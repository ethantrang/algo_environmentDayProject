[{"title": "PETA Won't Answer Some Very Basic Questions About Why It Kills So Many Shelter Animals", "text": "Last year, the nonprofit group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals euthanized more than 2,000 dogs and cats at its sole U.S. shelter -- and it's not at all clear how it made the decision to do so.The group has put down so many animals at its facility in Norfolk, Virginia, that in 2014 the state passed a law, SB 1381, that pointedly defined a private animal shelter as \"a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.\"PETA lobbied against that bill, and in a July email released to the public last week, a senior executive at the animal rights group argued to a Virginia lawmaker that there was no need for the legislation to exist at all.\"We have always found permanent adoptive homes for our adoptable animals, and will continue to do so,\" wrote Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of PETA, in a July 24 email to Virginia state Sen. Frank Wagner (R). \"No one disagrees that animal shelters -- private and public -- should have as a purpose finding permanent adoptive homes for adoptable animals. There is no need for a guidance document or additional regulations on this.\" (Emphasis in the original.)That PETA should have balked at increased regulatory attention comes as little surprise, given the group's preference for opacity over transparency in certain matters -- particularly the question of how it decides which animals to euthanize, and why it puts so many animals to death each year.Self-reported statistics filed with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services show that PETA's Norfolk shelter took in 1,606 cats in 2014, of which 1,536 were euthanized. Dogs fared a little better -- of the 1,025 taken in, 788 were euthanized.PETA doesn't dispute the figures. In fact, the group trumpeted them in a press release listing its 2014 accomplishments.But PETA has not been so forthcoming about what policies or processes it uses, if any, when making the decision to euthanize. Since the group's 2014 statistics were first reported in January, The Huffington Post has asked PETA multiple times for more information about how it actually determines which animals in its care will live and which will die. In each case, PETA has either declined to comment, failed to address the details of HuffPost's questions or failed to respond at all.PETA says its euthanasia figures reflect hundreds of humane killings, intended to end the suffering of animals who are -- in the words of a January press release -- \"elderly, feral, sick, dying, aggressive, and otherwise unadoptable.\" The group describes itself as a resource for animal owners of limited means.\"More than 500 [of these animals] were brought to PETA by destitute guardians desperate to alleviate their animals' suffering and others who had been turned away by 'no-kill' facilities that reject unadoptable animals in order to keep 'save rates' high,\" the release reads.The group's methods, however, are far from clear. There are few details available about how PETA workers reach the conclusion that a given animal is so aggressive, dying, feral or diseased that it can never be adopted. HuffPost has asked PETA whether it gives each animal a medical and behavioral exam, as is standard practice in many other shelters -- and how such exams, if they take place, inform PETA's decisions about euthanasia. The group has not provided that information.HuffPost posed these questions to PETA again last week, after the publication of Nachminovitch's letter. In response, Colleen O'Brien, the group's senior director of communications, replied as follows:Thank you for your e-mail. PETA has always served those in our community who have limited resources -- including those who can't afford veterinary care, even for euthanasia when their dogs and cats are suffering during old age or from sickness or injuries. We're there to take in the aggressive or feral animals rejected by other shelters for being unadoptable. We do so without appointments, waiting lists, fees, or restricted hours. And we save hundreds of lives every single day by preventing future homelessness with our fleet of clinics that spay and neuter more than 10,000 animals a year at no or low cost -- and close to 120,000 dogs and cats have been \"fixed\" so far in this area alone.\"The organization can certainly be its own worst enemy,\" reads the op-ed O'Brien cites, an unsigned editorial by the board of The Virginian-Pilot, a Norfolk newspaper. \"But PETA does a job no one else wants. Some of the region's other shelters have transitioned to 'no kill'; they euthanize no more than 10 percent of their animals and charge fees to those who drop one off. PETA fills a role that has been abandoned by other organizations ... The premise that PETA should simply be like other animal shelters and find homes for all the critters it takes in, regardless of their physical states, is unrealistic -- and unwise from a public policy perspective. As long as people abandon or surrender their pets, as long as other shelters choose to turn away injured, aggressive or feral animals, there'll be a need for PETA to do what it does.\"O'Brien did not respond to a request for further comment.'We never turn an animal away'PETA's many critics have described the group's kill rates as \"shocking\" and unnecessary.Robin Robertson Starr, chief executive officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Richmond, Virginia, told HuffPost in March that it was \"very troubling\" for PETA to continually repeat the claim that \"old, sick and injured animals\" couldn't find adoptive homes.\"Older animals are still very adoptable and age should not be seen as an impediment to adoption efforts,\" Starr said. \"It certainly is not at the Richmond SPCA, where we take in many senior pets and adopt them to lasting and loving homes.\"The Virginia legislature and governor seemed to share that view, passing and signing SB 1381 this spring over PETA's objections. A few months later, Nachminovitch wrote her email to the state senator, in which she cited PETA's record of taking in \"aggressive, dying, feral, diseased, and otherwise unadoptable animals.\"\"We never turn an animal away,\" Nachminovitch wrote. \"Of course our disposition outcome statistics are different from those of a private animal shelter that rejects animals precisely because they are unadoptable or difficult to place.\"The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has the authority to interpret and implement SB 1381. The law's sponsors predict that the legislation will force PETA to reduce its killing and increase its efforts to find homes for its animals.\"To an organization like PETA, whose average kill rate of companion animals taken into its 'shelter' exceeds 90 percent, this bill posed a threat,\" wrote the bill's sponsor, Virginia state Sen. Bill Stanley (R), in an opinion column in March. \"PETA does not operate a private animal shelter 'for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.'\"The law was supposed to go into effect on July 1, but VDACS is still drafting \"guidance documents.\" In an email last week, spokeswoman Elaine Lidholm told HuffPost to \"check back\" in three months on the status of the law.Meanwhile, in TexasWhile PETA is tight-lipped about its euthanasia practices, many other shelters readily share this information.\"Shelters are entrusted to care for the lost, stray, abandoned and abused animals,\" Steffen Baldwin, executive director for Top of Ohio Pet Shelter, a private shelter in rural Ohio, told HuffPost in an email. \"Any shelter that hides how that care is provided, including end of life decisions, is doing a disservice not only to the animals in their care, but to the sources of the funds to provide said care, as well as the public at large -- who trust our facilities and our staff to do right by each animal that comes through our doors.\"Many shelters simply post their behavioral and medical evaluation procedures online. Some also spoke with HuffPost directly.The Washington Humane Society is D.C.'s municipal shelter. Like PETA, WHS has an open-admission policy, meaning that it will take in any animal. As with PETA, this means WHS accepts many animals that have been rejected by smaller or limited-admission shelters -- \"animals that other groups won't or can't\" take in, as Stephanie Shain, the group's chief operating officer, put it.In 2014, WHS had a \"live release rate\" of 86.53 percent, meaning that more than 4 in every 5 animals left the shelter alive -- generally because they were adopted or reunited with their owners, or because an animal rescue group found a foster home for the animal and assumed care of it.Shain said that at WHS, before any decisions are made about euthanasia, animals receive a physical and behavioral evaluation. Animals with medical and behavioral issues \"routinely\" receive treatment, she said, including some with hard-to-treat conditions.Some animals found to have terminal or untreatable illnesses may get to live in an end-of-life foster home, where they will receive hospice care.\"These are for animals who aren't suffering but who have a condition that can't be treated,\" Shain said. \"Those animals won't likely be adopted, but we want the end of their life to be in a home and well cared for.\"But not every animal is saved.\"We do euthanize animals who have behavior problems we do not feel can be safely addressed or who have medical conditions that are beyond our ability to remedy,\" Shain said.Baldwin's organization, Top of Ohio Pet Shelter, was similarly forthcoming when asked about its policies and procedures.Baldwin said that his shelter takes in every stray dog, but not every cat, and not every dog given up by an owner. Last year, TOPS had a live release rate of over 90 percent.The animals that didn't make it were thoroughly evaluated before euthanasia was even considered as an option, Baldwin told HuffPost. Each of these animals received a medical exam performed by a veterinarian, as well as a formal behavioral evaluation akin to the ones developed by the ASPCA, supplemented with observations from shelter staff and volunteers.If it is determined that \"the animal is suffering beyond the point where medical care can end that suffering, or when the animal’s behavior is unsafe for us to place into the public and rehabilitation efforts with a reputable rescue have been exhausted,\" the animal will be put down, Baldwin said.The Austin Animal Center -- an open-admission city shelter in Austin, Texas, that takes in some 18,000 animals each year -- describes a similarly process. The shelter is known for maintaining a live release rate of at least 90 percent (though the office of the city auditor found earlier this year that AAC will need more resources to maintain that rate without overcrowding at the shelter).Kristen Auerbach, deputy chief animal services officer at AAC, said that \"animals receive initial and ongoing medical and behavioral assessments. We save the vast majority of animals that come into our shelter ... The only animals that are euthanized are ill and suffering with a poor prognosis or are unsafe to adopt.\"Both AAC and WHS will euthanize an animal if the owner comes in and asks for it. But neither facility will do this without first conducting an exam.\"When we have a pet surrendered for euthanasia, it is always examined by our vets prior to being euthanized to make sure the animal is suffering and truly needs to be euthanized,\" Auerbach said. \"We do not euthanize animals just because an owner requests they be euthanized.\"The roomIn March, a reporter from Religion News Services visited the PETA shelter in Norfolk, as Virginia was considering SB 1381 and as PETA was on a campaign to stop the legislation.The reporter, Lauren Markoe, saw the shelter's euthanasia room and seemed impressed with it, ending her story with these observations:The euthanasia clinic is on the ground floor. There is one small room, softly lit by a standing lamp. A poster is mounted above the padded surgical table where the animals receive their lethal injections. It shows three dogs that PETA staff have cared for, and reads:But if PETA's euthanasia room itself is dark and quiet, the path that leads to that room could use a bit more light.\"If PETA is truly operating a private shelter, as they claim and as defined under Virginia law, then they owe the public an explanation of the medical standards and veterinary analysis they apply before euthanizing a supposedly sick or injured animal,\" said Starr, the CEO of the Richmond SPCA. \"If they are in fact a euthanasia facility rather than a shelter, then they should acknowledge that honestly and not seek to come under the private shelter regulations.\"Last year, incidentally, VDACS data shows that the Richmond SPCA took in 2,189 cats and 1,670 dogs. Starr says many came in with bad illnesses or injuries. Each animal was given thorough medical evaluations, and, where needed, veterinary care.Seven of the dogs and one of the cats were euthanized.Hilary Hanson contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Pope Francis Hails Tech To Fight Climate Change In 'Our Common Home'", "text": "If Pope Francis' prayers are answered, humanity will devote more of its collective efforts toward cleaning up our planet instead of polluting it. How and where he thinks technological progress should play a role in those efforts is a more complicated question.President Barack Obama officially welcomed the pope to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. At the White House, Francis began his remarks by applauding the United States' history of immigration. He went on to say that climate change was an issue that must be addressed now.\"Mr. President, I find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution,\" the pope said, as Obama looked on.He continued:Accepting the urgency, it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. When it comes to the care of our \"common home,\" we are living at a critical moment of history. We still have time to make the changes needed to bring about “a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change” (Laudato Si’, 13). Such change demands on our part a serious and responsible recognition not only of the kind of world we may be leaving to our children, but also to the millions of people living under a system which has overlooked them.Video of the pope's full remarks is embedded below.The pope's recent focus on climate change has not been uncontroversial in the U.S., where the partisan divide over global warming remains as wide as ever, despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on the matter.According to the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of Americans believe global warming is occurring, but only 22 percent of Republicans say that it's because of human activity -- something that nearly all of the world's scientists agree to be the case. The hottest summer on record has done little to shift those views, much less galvanize the Republican-controlled Congress to take action. It seems unlikely that the Pope's address to the U.S. legislature on Thursday will alter the trajectory of that debate.Based on a generous reading of the encyclical that Francis wrote earlier this year, it seems like he would probably endorse the White House's use of open climate data in the hopes of increasing the resilience of the coastal cities where a majority of humanity will live in future decades, and enabling governors and mayors to protect hundreds of millions of people.After all, in a June letter to the Catholic Church, the pope laid out a moral case for fighting climate change grounded in the need to protect the poor from pollution and environmental degradation.In that letter, the pope embraced and supported the development of clean technology, including solar energy, to replace fossil fuels.But even as he heralded technology as a possible solution, he decried not only the role that industrialization has played in pollution but also a modern mindset that exalts the use of technology to manipulate the natural world.\"It can be said that many problems of today’s world stem from the tendency, at times unconscious, to make the method and aims of science and technology an epistemological paradigm which shapes the lives of individuals and the workings of society,\" he wrote.Given the Catholic Church's history with practitioners of the scientific method, we might be inclined to take that with a grain of salt, but in fairness the church has moved away from being an enemy of science in recent centuries.Pope Francis himself appears to have something of a love-hate relationship with technology. The 78-year-old pontiff, who holds a degree in chemistry, has supported the application of technology in various areas, including genetic modification in agriculture, and has called the Internet a \"gift from God.\" He's also urged young people not to waste time online or on smartphones, which almost all of us do.The man often described as the most influential world leader on Twitter uses social media to communicate with the public as @Pontifex, albeit not personally -- he has confessed to being a \"disaster with machines\" himself.The pope has also urged families to employ technology thoughtfully, using screen sense as well as common sense when it comes to incorporating devices into our lives.\"By growing daily in our awareness of the vital importance of encountering others, these 'new possibilities,' we will employ technology wisely, rather than letting ourselves be dominated by it,\" he wrote in January.The pope called attention in his climate change encyclical to the limits of taking an explicitly technocratic approach to a complex social, economic and environmental issue.\"Ecological culture cannot be reduced to a series of urgent and partial responses to the immediate problems of pollution, environmental decay and the depletion of natural resources,\" he wrote. \"There needs to be a distinctive way of looking at things, a way of thinking, policies, an educational programme, a lifestyle and a spirituality which together generate resistance to the assault of the technocratic paradigm.\"In his encyclical, Pope Francis expressed concern about the effects of technology on our capacity to make decisions and find space for creativity. More subtly, he wrote about the need to use technology in a moral and ethical way, one that makes change possible without abandoning our ideals of \"freedom and justice.\"But he also acknowledged that in many ways, technology has improved life in ways that would have once seemed impossible.\"We are the beneficiaries of two centuries of enormous waves of change: steam engines, railways, the telegraph, electricity, automobiles, aeroplanes, chemical industries, modern medicine, information technology and, more recently, the digital revolution, robotics, biotechnologies and nanotechnologies,\" the pope wrote. \"It is right to rejoice in these advances and to be excited by the immense possibilities which they continue to open up before us, for 'science and technology are wonderful products of a God-given human creativity.'\"Whether or not you agree with his views on technology -- and not everyone does -- the pope's focus on applying tech for public good, and his habit of calling attention to the ethical questions that disruptive technology can pose to society, are bringing more sunlight to issues that deserve it.I think that's a valuable public service, and it's one reason among many that I welcomed Pope Francis to Washington on Wednesday. Here's hoping that his presence brings about more connection, not more controversy."}, {"title": "Yoplait Yogurt Cups Have Been Killing Small Animals For Years", "text": "Laura Simon calls Yoplait yogurt cups a \"death sentence\" for skunks.Small animals will stick their heads inside all sorts of discarded food containers to consume scraps of food, but classic Yoplait yogurt cups -- the kind that have a tapered shape and foil lid -- pose a special risk. They include an inside rim that makes it easy for an animal to stick its head into the cup, but nearly impossible to pull it out.\"This is really a terrible source of peril,\" Simon, a Connecticut-based wildlife ecologist and skunk specialist with the Humane Society of the United States, told The Huffington Post.General Mills, the marketer of Yoplait in the U.S., has known since at least 1998 that the yogurt cups have been killing wildlife, but the company has done little to alter the deadly design, Simon and other animal advocates say.Animals happen upon the cups when people cast them aside as litter, but even those that have been safely thrown away can pose a problem, as animals can break into dumpsters or rip open bags of trash left outside.The design is especially problematic for skunks, which have paws that are not designed for the grasping action necessary to pull off the cup. Additionally, the Yoplait cup’s distinct structure -- narrow at the top and wider at the base -- is the perfect shape to trap a skunk’s wedge-shaped head. Squirrels also fall victim to the containers, Simon said, though not as frequently.Skunks trapped in yogurt containers sometimes appear in viral videos showing benevolent police officers rescuing the animals, but the cute clips belie a serious, often deadly, problem.Police in Rochester, Michigan, confirmed the skunk in this August video was stuck in a Yoplait cup (story continues below):Once an animal's head is stuck inside the cup, Simon explained, they're likely doomed to death from suffocation, or worse, from dehydration after days of not being able to drink. Sometimes animals that have their heads stuck in the cups will run blindly into roadways, which also poses a danger to drivers who swerve to avoid them.Simon ran a national wildlife help hotline for 18 years, and currently handles national information requests for HSUS. She says she receives at least one call a month about a small wild animal, typically a skunk, that has its head stuck inside a Yoplait yogurt container. In the spring and summer, when more people are spending time outside, she says she generally fields multiple calls of that nature, up to a dozen, each month.Other animal advocates are also familiar with the issue.\"I’ve pulled them off skunks’ heads before,\" said Shirley Zindler, an animal control officer in Sonoma County, California. She said she only gets a couple of calls each year about skunks, but both Zindler and Simon said they suspect there are far more cases that people either never see, or simply don’t report. There's no official estimate on how many animal fatalities the cups cause each year.General Mills is aware of the issue. Camilla Fox, founder and executive director of nonprofit animal protection group Project Coyote, fought to get the company to change the cup design in 1998. At that time, Fox was with the Animal Protection Institute, a national animal advocacy group that teamed up with HSUS to generate thousands of letters to General Mills, culminating in a meeting with higher-ups at the company. Fox noted that other wildlife activists had conducted previous campaigns to get the design changed as well.The effort had two outcomes: General Mills added an outside edge to the base of Yoplait cups, ostensibly to give animals leverage in pushing the cups off their heads, and added a small warning that reads: \"Protect Wildlife Crush Cup Before Disposal.\"When asked about the cups’ threats to wildlife, Mike Siemienas, General Mills brand relations manager, told The Huffington Post in an email:Because wildlife will try to eat from containers of all shapes and sizes, we do urge consumers to crush containers before disposal. We also encourage consumers to dispose of all containers properly. We print the message \"protect wildlife crush before disposal\" on our cup for that reason.\"Frankly, that just doesn’t cut it,\" said Simon, noting that the added edge doesn’t do much to assist skunks. The warning, she points out, is so small many people never see it, and it doesn’t explain how the cups actually pose a threat to wildlife. Moreover, compressing the cup is fairly difficult.\"I’ve tried crushing it,\" she said. \"It’s hard to do, and then it just resumes its shape if you don’t really pound it. It’s not a good solution at all.\"Siemienas did not have further comment on follow-up questions about why General Mills has not addressed the cup’s inside rim, or whether the company has any plans to further modify the cup’s design.Fox, however, said that in her previous communication with the company, General Mills expressed concerns about the costs involved in making certain changes, which would mandate altering their factory machinery. But amending the cup's design is the only way to fix the issue for good, according to Fox.\"Until they change the shape of that container, this is going to be an ongoing problem,\" she said.If yogurt consumers aren’t willing to boycott Yoplait, Simon said, she advises them to thoroughly wash the cup with hot water before cutting it into pieces and putting them in the trash.If people encounter a skunk or other small creature with its head stuck in a Yoplait cup, she suggests they place a milk crate, upside-down laundry basket or similar object over the animal to keep it in place until help arrives -- by the time officers can respond to about three-quarters of the calls she receives, she said, the skunk has already run off. She noted that skunks won't spray something they can't see.Rebecca Dmytryk, president of Wildlife Emergency Services, an animal rescue service in Moss Landing, California, is behind an online petition pressuring General Mills to change the container designer. Dmytryk said that she’s heartened by the number of people who take the time to assist animals trapped in the container.\"When people come across an animal that’s in this condition, how do you walk away from that?\" she asked.Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.comAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "More Than 1 Million Malaria Cases Per Year Due to African Dams, Study Finds", "text": "I didn't feel well during my visit to India's Narmada Valley, where the Sardar Sarovar Dam was flooding the homes of poor farmers, in 2001. I stayed with affected villagers and joined their protests, but after a while came down with persistent fevers and diarrhea. By the time I reached the closest city, I was so weak and dehydrated that my friends checked me into a hospital. I had contracted malaria, the doctors found.The connection between dams and malaria has long been known. The stagnant water of reservoirs and the puddles along their shorelines create perfect conditions for the Anopheles mosquito, which transmits malaria, to breed. Yet until now, the problem has never been comprehensively examined. In a new study under the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems, Solomon Kibret and four co-researchers closed this gap. Combining databases on dams, malaria and population densities, they systematically analyzed how the incidence of malaria increases around African reservoirs.The researchers identified 723 dams that are located in Sub-Saharan areas where malaria prevails. Close to 15 million people live within 5 kilometers of their reservoirs -- the maximum distance that Anopheles mosquitoes can fly. The researchers found that these people suffer more than 1.1 million additional malaria cases per year due to the reservoirs. In other words, one out of thirteen people in the vicinity of such reservoirs suffers from dam-induced malaria -- year for year. The 442,000 people who live near the 60 proposed dam sites in Africa's malaria regions are expected to suffer an additional 56,000 malaria cases every year if the dams are built.The researchers acknowledge that the number of 1.1 million cases is certainly an underestimate. They could not find exact data for more than 800 other African dams, most of which are also located in malaria regions. Assuming they have similar impacts, the total number of African malaria cases due to reservoirs could well reach 2 million per year.I was privileged to have good health insurance when I picked up malaria along the Sardar Sarovar reservoir. For most people in rural Africa, malaria means extended suffering, entrenched poverty and occasionally even death. None of these impacts are addressed in the typical assessments of proposed dams. Likewise, afflicted people have no recourse to compensation for their suffering.Public health impacts need to be part of the equation when the costs and benefits of dams and other options such as wind and solar projects are compared. Dam operators should be required to set up trust funds from which malaria victims can be compensated. The authors of the new study also recommend that dams be operated in a way that minimizes the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Finally, public health measures such as the strengthening of local clinics and the distribution of mosquito nets should be part of any dam project that moves forward in a malaria-prone region.\"Whilst recognizing the importance of dams for economic development,\" Solomon Kibret and his co-authors conclude, \"it is unethical that people living close to them pay the price of that development through increased suffering and, in extreme cases, loss of life due to disease. Those building dams must invest effectively in measures to prevent malaria transmission.\"Solomon Kibret, Jonathan Lautze, Matthew McCartney, G. Glenn Wilson, Luxon Nhamo.

I summarized part of that trend in four words, \"Our Investors Require It.\" Now I'd like to offer another four-word business case.Most private sector money used to construct green buildings comes from mortgage lenders, not equity investors. So this time I want to focus on exciting, new demand for green buildings coming from the lending community.\"Our Lender Values It\"Equity investors seek to enhance their properties' long-term value. Simultaneously, their mortgage lenders are interested in reducing risk. A lender's primary risk is the borrower's inability to repay the mortgage or the potential to default on specific terms and conditions. Mortgage lenders evaluate debt-financing requests through this lens -- to mitigate risk, lenders look for a property to generate steady, positive cash flow over the loan term. Properties also need to withstand economic fluctuations, market competition and the natural \"aging\" or obsolescence of the property. With leading lenders around the globe, \"certified green collateral\" plays an important part when calculating mortgage risk.Now, as never before, green buildings are recognized as high-quality collateral and, therefore, an important variable to reducing risk. A new study from the University of Arizona makes this case with graphic clarity. Professors there mapped the \"relationship between sustainability property features and corresponding commercial mortgage default risk.\"Their findings reveal that commercial mortgage loans with collateral consisting of buildings certified as ENERGY STAR® have a lower likelihood of loan default when compared to non-ENERGY STAR buildings. Where the collateral is LEED-certified, default risk is significantly lower than non-LEED-rated buildings.This research echoes a working paper by Professor Nils Kok, with colleagues Piet Eichholtz, Rogier Holtermans and Erkan Yonder, that shows pricing advantages for both commercial mortgages and corporate bonds issued by U.S. REITs since 2000. There is also the 2013 University of North Carolina research report that found lower default rates for residential energy efficient buildings with an ENEGY STAR rating.And no less an authority than Fannie Mae recently announced that multifamily properties that are green building certified by third-party standards (including LEED and ENERGY STAR) will receive a 10-basis-point discount in mortgage rates. Even with mortgage rates at historically low levels, 10 basis points is real money. For example, a reduction of the interest rate from 5% to 4.9% on a $10 million multifamily loan would save almost $100,000 in interest payments over the life of the loan. Professor Kok points out that Fannie Mae's interest rate represents the \"first tangible pricing differentiation [he has] seen in the real estate market\" for green building certified properties. Put succinctly: Fannie Mae Multifamily associates green-building-certified properties with lower risk, and values that reduced risk by charging borrowers a lower interest rate.In this same great article, Kok notes: \"On the corporate bond side, the green bond market has made significant strides, and for real estate in particular we have seen five REITs/property companies issuing green bonds including Vasakronan, Regency Centers, Vornado, Unibail-Rodamco issue Land II, and Stockland.\" The proceeds from these general obligation bonds are being used to \"green up\" these portfolios through the construction and renovation of buildings to green standards - BREEAM, Green Star and LEED are all used by these green bond issuers. These kinds of developments were almost unimaginable just a few years ago.U.S.-based lenders have a history of catalyzing environmentally responsible borrower behavior. After the terrible hazardous waste spills that gave rise to the superfund law, lenders required borrowers to undertake a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment as a condition of funding. The assessments made more transparent the degree of environmental risk associated with collateral.Leading banks are now also assessing the positive environmental features of their properties--and of the borrower's entire enterprise. With the use of Environmental, Social and Governance metrics like GRESB on the rise coupled with the Appraisal Foundation's recent advisory on high performance building valuation, it seems reasonable to project that non-green building collateral or non-green real estate enterprises may be subject to different risk assessments by lenders based on their underlying asset and corporate-risk profiles.It's a good time to be in the green building industry. The four-word business case - \"Our Lender Values It\" - means that real estate investors and lenders need to ask a simple question: \"Can I afford the risk of not having a green property?\""}, {"title": "Shelter Pets Pose For Retro Yearbook Photos And It's Glorious", "text": "These back to school photos of shelter pets are giving us a really good education in adorableness.Extra credit for Barbara Hutcherson, acting director of the Fairfax County Animal Shelter in Northern Virginia, who came up with the A+ idea for these pics.\"In my previous life, I was a teacher and Back to School Night was always an important part of each new school year,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"Why not get the animals in on it?\"The cats and dogs didn't actually put on tuxes, or sit in front of lasers for these photos.

Procter and Gamble set its sights on a short-term goal for 30 percent renewable energy by 2020, while some companies, like financial services firm Voya International and furniture maker Steelcase, are closing in or have already reached a full reliance on renewable energy.That these Fortune 500 firms have thrown their significant weight behind RE100, a global campaign to cut down on CO2 emissions by turning to renewable sources of energy, suggests a major shift in corporations' awareness of their responsibility to lead their respective industries away from carbon.And companies are realizing the business boost gained by placing financial incentives on themselves to use renewable sources. A recent report by the environmental nonprofit CDP, which organizes RE100 in partnership with The Climate Group, found that the number of companies putting a price on their carbon emissions has tripled since last year.\"Lowering risk, protecting against price rises, saving millions and boosting brand is what shaping a low carbon economy is all about,\" Climate Group CEO Mark Kenber said in a statement.The corporate sustainability movement is gaining speed: RE100 launched last year with 13 members, including Ikea, H&M, Nestle, Unilever and Mars. That number has since grown to nearly 40, with groups joining from across various industries. Recent members include financial services provider UBS and Dutch sciences company Royal DSM. Ikea, everyone's favorite furniture go-to, has installed 700,000 solar panels on its buildings and last year generated renewal energy to match 42 percent of its total energy consumption. H&M, among the many retail outlets facing pressure for contributing to wasteful fast fashion, plans to cut its electricity usage by 20 percent by 2020.Companies are finding various ways to harness efforts to reduce their carbon footprint as an economic opportunity. Under The B Team, a nonprofit led by top business leaders, companies like Unilever and Virgin are seeking to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.And as part of a coalition to promote sustainable business practices, HP expects to hit its emissions target early after partnering with SunEdison to rely on wind power, while L'Oreal is expanding its use of solar panels at various facilities across the globe.

One of the latest TPP sales pitches from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and other TPP proponents is that the deal would help protect endangered wildlife like rhinos and elephants.Such promises about the supposed environmental benefits of trade pacts are not new. Time and again, we have been told that unpopular trade deals would reduce environmental degradation in trade partner countries. And time and again, as explained below, these promises have proven empty.Luckily, we have other policy tools that can and should be used immediately to help save endangered species from extinction. Here are four reasons that we should use those tools rather than relying on the TPP:1. TPP-like deals have repeatedly failed to live up to promises of environmental protection.Twenty-two years ago President Bill Clinton proclaimed the environmental side agreement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a \"force for social progress,\" claiming it would lead to \"better preservation of the environment.\" Instead, NAFTA facilitated the expansion of fossil-fuel-heavy agribusiness in the United States, incentivized a boom in environmentally destructive mining in Mexico, undermined the ability to regulate carbon-intensive tar sands in Canada, and empowered multinational firms to demand taxpayer compensation for environmental protections in all three countries.The legacy of using empty environmental promises to sell trade deals didn't stop with NAFTA. In 2007 USTR promised the U.S. - Peru trade deal would \"promote legal trade in timber products.\" The promise was based on the deal's detailed set of rules on forests that, unlike NAFTA's unenforceable environmental side agreement, were legally binding. Indeed, the pact required Peru \"to combat trade associated with illegal logging\" and specified a litany of reforms that Peru had to take to fulfill this requirement.But after more than six years of the U.S. - Peru trade deal, widespread illegal logging remains unchecked in Peru's Amazon rain forest. A 2014 study in Scientific Reports found that about 70 percent of Peru's supervised logging concessions are being used for illegal logging. The World Bank, meanwhile, estimates that eight out of ten logs exported by Peru have been cut illegally.For years, U.S. environmental groups have called on USTR to use the rules in the trade deal to counter Peru's extensive illegal logging. In 2012, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) formally petitioned USTR to take action under the deal to verify the legality of timber shipments from two Peruvian companies that were notorious for exporting illegally-cut logs to the United States. EIA's head of Peru programs stated at the time, \"It is the responsibility of the US Government to make sure that the US is not an accomplice in illegal logging activities.\"But USTR took no such action. To date, Peru has faced no formal challenges, much less penalties, under the trade pact, despite ample evidence that Peru has violated the pact's rules by illegally cutting Amazonian trees and exporting them to unwitting U.S. consumers. In June 2015, EIA concluded, \"Not only has no one been held accountable for past violations, but the U.S. is turning a blind eye to ongoing trade in timber that should be considered at high risk of illegality.\"Even more, just last year Peru explicitly rolled back an array of environmental protections in order to attract foreign investment - a clear violation of the supposedly enforceable terms of the U.S. - Peru trade pact. Sierra Club, EIA, CIEL and other leading U.S. environmental groups once again called on USTR to use the U.S. - Peru deal to reverse this weakening of environmental protections. Yet, once again USTR has failed to take action.The consistent track record of non-enforcement of environmental provisions of trade pacts hardly inspires trust in the all-too-familiar assertion that the latest trade deal - the TPP - would help protect wildlife. This promise is particularly doubtful given that...2. The TPP's environmental terms are expected to be weaker than the unenforced provisions of the Peru trade deal.A recent statement by U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman indicates that the TPP, like the U.S. - Peru trade deal, would commit signatory governments to \"combat\" illegal trade in endangered animals. The Sierra Club and many other U.S. environmental groups repeatedly called for stronger language to \"prohibit\" the trade, transshipment or sale of products taken or traded in violation of national laws or applicable foreign laws that protect wildlife. However, the final text is expected to stick with the weaker provision.Worse still, in a step backwards from the Peru trade deal, the TPP is not expected to spell out specific legal reforms and enforcement measures that TPP countries like Vietnam and Malaysia must undertake to \"combat\" illegal wildlife trade. This omission could open a large loophole for illegal trade in products like elephant tusks and rhino horns to continue. This is particularly concerning given that surging demand for rhino horns in Vietnam is helping to drive a spike in rhino poaching in South Africa.Even with the U.S. - Peru pact's stronger provisions against illegal logging, repeated efforts to push the U.S. government to use the trade deal to halt Peru's widespread illegal timber trade have fallen on deaf ears. If the Peru deal's stronger environmental enforcement terms have failed to halt illegal trade in timber in Peru, why should we expect the TPP's weaker provisions to be more successful in halting illegal trade in rhino horns in Vietnam?3. The TPP could exacerbate threats to endangered species by incentivizing wider destruction of their habitats.Beyond failing to protect endangered wildlife like elephants and rhinos, the TPP could actually contribute to the loss of their habitats, in part by expanding demand for destructive cash crops like oil palm (used to produce edible palm oil, cosmetics, detergents and other products). Studies have documented how oil palm plantations in TPP member Malaysia - the world's second largest palm oil producer - have contributed to the disappearance of habitats for endangered species.Indeed, the Sumatran rhino was just declared extinct in Malaysia, due in part to habitat loss driven by the expansion of oil palm plantations. And 14 rare pygmy elephants were recently found dead in Malaysia after apparent poisoning from pesticides used on oil palm plantations.The TPP is likely to encourage greater oil palm expansion in TPP countries like Malaysia by increasing demand for exports of palm oil. The TPP is widely expected to significantly reduce or eliminate most agricultural tariffs - that ostensibly includes the palm oil tariffs currently imposed by major palm oil importing TPP countries like Vietnam and Japan. If those tariffs would drop, palm oil exports - and thus, oil palm production - would be expected to rise in TPP countries like Malaysia. Expanding oil palm plantations would spell shrinking habitats for endangered animals, heightening the risk that they could face the same fate as Malaysia's extinct rhinos.In addition, the TPP would expand NAFTA rules that empower multinational corporations to go before private trade tribunals to challenge government policies that protect endangered species. This threat is not hypothetical - just a few months ago, a NAFTA tribunal ruled that Canada's rejection of a controversial open-pit mining project violated NAFTA's foreign investor protections despite the fact that a Canadian environmental review panel found that the project could have threatened the endangered North Atlantic Right Whale.4. We have alternative tools to reduce illegal wildlife trade - ones that have proven more effective and less risky than trade deals.To protect endangered species like elephants and rhinos, we do not need to rely on another unenforceable trade deal that may, in fact, pose threats to their habitats. Other more effective tools exist to reduce illegal wildlife trade - ones that are free of the TPP's threats to the environment.For example, all TPP member nations are among the 181 signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which places restrictions on trade in products from endangered species, including rhinos and elephants. While enforcement of CITES has been a challenge in some countries, the U.S. government has successfully used CITES in concert with a U.S. law called the Pelly Amendment to compel Taiwan to meaningfully reduce illegal trade in rhino horns. The Pelly Amendment authorizes the U.S. president to indefinitely ban the importation of \"any products\" from a country if U.S. agencies find the government to be in violation of CITES by allowing prohibited wildlife trade. EIA, the Animal Welfare Institute and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have formally petitioned the U.S. government to use the Pelly Amendment to push Vietnam to curtail its illegal rhino trade.And the Obama administration already has committed to using dozens of policy tools beyond the TPP as part of a recently-unveiled National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, which seeks to achieve such goals as \"a near‐total U.S. ban on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade.\" These tools include strengthening existing U.S. laws such as the Endangered Species Act, increasing the number of U.S. agents stationed abroad to investigate illegal wildlife trade, and working more closely with the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to dismantle illegal wildlife trade networks.Additionally, the United States can fully enforce the Lacey Act, a law that prohibits imports, sales and purchases of illegally-sourced plants and wildlife. This landmark law has been used for decades to crack down on trade in illegal wildlife products.Such tools hold greater potential than the TPP to reduce illegal wildlife trade, while avoiding the TPP's threats to critical habitats and environmental protections. We cannot afford another unenforceable trade deal that not only fails to reduce the threats endangered species face, but risks exacerbating them. To protect endangered animals, we need tools that actually work, which includes more effectively using the ones we already have.This post originally ran on the Sierra Club's blog, Lay of the Land."}, {"title": "Legacy Litmus Test", "text": "When the word \"legacy\" is mentioned in connection with President Obama's place in history, most Republican members of Congress go bananas. It's tantamount to waving a red flag in front of an apoplectic bull.Hence, Republican lawmakers have united in reflex fashion to oppose Obama's Affordable Health Care Act, the Iran Nuclear Pact, and major Administration environmental initiatives, all perceived cornerstones of his legacy.Indeed, Republican legislators on Capitol Hill are behaving as if determined to deny Obama any legacy whatsoever. It is this mindset that has become a litmus test for party loyalty. Failure to toe the line raises the prospect of a formidable Right Wing primary challenge that could end one's political career.Whether any of Obama's legacy-related initiatives would benefit the nation is irrelevant for Republicans in Congress' bitterly partisan atmosphere. Nor does it make any difference if Obama's ideas were borrowed from Republicans or were previously supported by the GOP. If they can be linked to his legacy, that is reason enough for repudiation.To make matters worse, congressional Republicans have been so preoccupied with impeding Obama's legacy that they have neglected to develop viable alternative policies. This is especially true of environmental problems. Cases in point are two major Obama initiatives--the curbing of carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and the protection of streams that are a source of drinking water for much of the nation. Republicans' patently false rebuttal is to insist that cleaning up the environment will destroy the economy.Fear of political reprisals has kept Republican lawmakers from breaking ranks. That is even the case when they find themselves at odds with the scientific consensus that global warming exists and demands a prompt corrective response. Every Republican House member recently voted to reject a resolution endorsing that consensus, even though one of their number confided that at least a third of his colleagues in private think otherwise.An occasional modest Republican attempt to demonstrate separation from the obsessive crusade against an Obama legacy has proven illusory. For example, a handful of GOP senators went on record that global warming was a legitimate concern, but thanks to intimidating party discipline, shied away from advocating that anything be done about it. Obama has made no secret of his hope that jumpstarting the transition to renewable energy will be an important part of his legacy. Because of the popularity of renewable energy, Republicans have not dared to discredit it directly. Instead, they have sought to sabotage Obama's grand design by dismissing renewable energy technology as insufficiently advanced and still much too expensive.Few actions have contributed more to the legacies of past presidents than the designation of conservation-oriented national monuments on public lands--and Obama is no exception. Predictably, congressional Republicans have sought to dilute this statutory executive authority, invoked by Obama's predecessors with little or no outcry from Congress.Congressional Republican majorities want to erase Obama's reign from the pages of history as much as possible. It's a fool's errand detracting from the GOP's ability to govern."}, {"title": "The Quest for Natural Intelligence in the World", "text": "Unplugged at the Root, so Makes Sense that We've Earth OvershootWe tap into central intelligence to assess trends, to make important decisions, and to launch sensitive missions. We pool our national intelligence from different agencies and resources to optimize our foreign relations and national security interests. We build artificial intelligence platforms, software, robotics to perform work faster, organize knowledge more efficiently, and even begin to create new knowledge. We encourage natural talent in different areas; like sports, medicine, music, philosophy, art, and science. But whatever happened in today's world to sourcing our inherent natural intelligence as I coin it here for solving intimately personal and globally shared challenges? Perhaps we have simply forgotten what natural intelligence means to us in our lives.Natural Intelligence refers to principles of life and to our lifestyle choices that respect the natural limits and boundaries of earth's resources.Natural Intelligence refers to an emotional impulse inherent in our universal myth that stimulates us to value and to protect the integrity of all living beings.Natural Intelligence refers to an intellectual quest to understand nature's survival strategies accumulated over 3+ billion years and etched into the DNA of circa 8.7 million species alive today in order to tool ourselves with tips, tricks, and strategic design traits for adapting to increasing rates of global change.Natural Intelligence refers to the celebration of our own unique natural wisdom, which we pass down through generations across cultures and time in art and story.Natural Intelligence refers to our intimate, interdependent connection to the larger web of life in the biosphere, whereas even in our physical bodies 80% of the biological DNA is foreign to our personal DNA. We are of earth.Natural Intelligence refers to our innate, universal quest to touch and to expand the brilliant and sacred nature of the living universe.Given the definition of natural intelligence, I want to be clear that in our quest to rediscover Natural Intelligence in our lives and in our world I am not suggesting a return to the romantic notion of the \"noble savage\". Rather, I am proposing that we resolve forward to increase the vibration of our pure and primal selves, so that we may again harmonize with the rest of the living planet, singing naturally together as an integral ecological choir. Given Pope Francis' Encyclical on the Environment, I imagine that will be his message to the world in his visit to the United States, celebrating also this International Day of Peace.Clearly, we are primed for a re-tuning as a global society. This past August 13th was Earth Overshoot Day for 2015. Each year the date moves father back into the heart of our Northern Hemisphere's hot and dry summer. It is aberrant that humanity (on average/as a whole) currently consumes 1.6 earth's worth of planetary natural resources per year. And, imagine that by 2030 we may even consume 2 earth's worth of resources per year if we continue on our current development track, as cautioned by the Global Footprint Network. How is it even possible that our global society has the capacity to produce an ecologic footprint so gigantic, so as to walk the knife's edge of biological bankruptcy and to create a nature debt overloaded with interest so high that our seventh generation future will surely struggle to re-pay it?Indeed, we may seek relief in Peter Diamandis' Abundance theory. Yes, advanced technologies, more efficient tools, naturally intelligent design solutions, and circular-service economic protocols help mitigate our heavy earth impact; stretching the value and use of our natural capital. But the truth is that we still live on a planet with finite resources and an ever-increasing demand on them. Imagine, we are 7.2 billion people strong and growing toward 9 billion in the next 20-30 years--every one of us with greater energy and resource needs leading into that next now future. Clearly, our ecological footprint will continue to grow on a linear trajectory... unless....We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children. --Native American ProverbOr... Unless we start course-correcting the tell tale signs of ecosystem collapse-- water shortages and extended drought (California, Mexico), dried underground aquifers thirty for recharge (Yemen, Qatar), expanding deserts across once biodiverse savannahs (northern Sahara), erosion of organic soils and increased salinity (Pacific, SE Asian islands), reduced cropland productivity (India, US), overgrazing (Eastern Europe, CA), deforestation (SE Asia, SA), rapid rates of species extinction (globally, as urban jungles expand), fisheries collapse (Nordic region), pollinators (bees, bats) at risk, and increased carbon concentration in the atmosphere (accounting now for more than 50% of our eco-footprint)--signs of ecological collapse in big, bright neon signs all around us.How on earth did we do that...right? How on earth did we ever become so disconnected at the root to have so grossly earth overshoot? We are a good people. We love our children, families, and friends. We work hard for companies and governments, mostly with the right intention to make the world a better place. We are social and communal creatures, who want to live a life of purpose in service to others. So clearly, somewhere in the midst of survival, progress, industry, and production we lost our way.\"A technological and economically developed world which does not leave in its wake a better world and an integrally higher quality of life one can not be considered progress.\" Pope FrancisMoving so laser-net fast across a myriad of smart and mobile platforms, relating to one another in our physical world behind virtual screens, playing war games in violent alternate realities that skew our perceptions of reality itself, constructing modern life into sky cities so distant from our indigenous earthen roots, rocketing off planet to explore new stars when the one we inhabit already uniquely supports the narrow requirements of life, manufacturing even more stuff for transient human use from minerals now mined on meteors, knitting global economies together so deep and so intimate, yet paper-thin...we risk having viscerally, virtually, vitally unplugged from the life force of planet earth. And this is our home!There is no other place in the infinitely vast star-studded space that we've yet found, traveling to distant galaxies 120 light years away, that is close enough or comfortable enough for us to realistically consider colonizing today or tomorrow. There is no Plan B here and now for inhabiting any other planet anywhere else in the universe. There is no Second Earth. And even if there was, there is no second human+nature again because more than 80% of the biological DNA in our bodies is comprised of DNA from organisms foreign to our personal DNA. Fascinating and scary at the same time... right?\"Humans are like dust devils, which swirl up from the elemental earth, dance on the surface for a time, then fall back into dust. We are of the earth. \" Kim Stanley RobinsonSo we better start treating our Eikos (home) as if we intend to stay... lest the natural evolutionary levers that pull species in and out of their time-space earthly existence...may force a permanent eviction.Depressed? Oh no. Now is NOT the time to fear and fret! It's the time to be fierce and fast moving! It's the time to \"turn on\" our creative brilliance and regenerate the planet. It's the time to chime into a global innovation dance ... that has already begun.Homo sapiens...we are a special species. When 100,000 years ago we set out from the Horn of Africa to bugle and battle and build our way into every living biome on every continental shelf and in every corner of the earth; we innovated and adapted by tuning into our communal nature and honing creative design teams comprised of unique, unrelated others. We invented and healed. We became heroes and explorers and adventurists. Over the millennia we expanded our intellectual horizons, our collective boundaries of being... and when given right motivation and right Apollo 13 Mission...we met our future head on with brilliant solutions to our global challenges. Like Uber in mobility, Apple in the world of IT, Google in the universe of knowledge, NREL in renewables research, MIT in robotics design, Stanford in medical, and Space X in... well, space ...we are constantly disrupting the past and inventing the future. So, as ecological overshoot is only possible for a limited time, we better get on NOW with building bold and brilliant solutions to our Climate-Development Mission Possible Challenge. Why wait and risk hitting \"more\" ecological tipping points that trigger irreversible feedback loops (already happening with the melting of Himalayan glaciers, Arctic sea ice, and Siberian permafrost)... set earth evolution on a different future trajectory that may not support humanity, and watch biomes crash with our grandchildren?This future scenario is fast becoming our reality, so it's time!It's time to rediscover our connection to the natural world and to reclaim our primary nature- our Natural Intelligence. It's time to be heroic actors in the design of a future that celebrates and preserves our natural existence. It's time to better understand our stewardship role in the biosphere. It's time to intensely study nature's strategies for survival and create a playbook for humanity's future \"thrival\". It's time to learn to live together generously and regeneratively (not just sustainably) in a way that respects nature's finite resource limits and perceives our happy and healthy existence tied to that of others--all others. It's time to LIVE those transformative stories that reinforce the ethics, values, and virtues of being in harmony and balance with the Nature that sustains us. It's time to really ACT--to finance, to design, to engineer, and to construct the Next Now Future that not only regenerates Nature, but also regenerates our peaceful, prosperous, passionate nature.

Mazzant in Sherman Texas, a Dallas suburb, recently sentenced Thomas W. Lucas Jr., 35, to 17 ½ years in prison for criminal fraud and lying to the FBI. Lucas had dishonestly taken money from 280 people who thought they were buying land to be used in a new Disney Park. Judge Mazzant, who also ordered Lucas to pay $8.4 million in restitution, said upon sentencing that Lucas \"caused a lot of damage to a lot of people.\" True, for sure.Lucas committed a \"little personal crime\" and thus gets personal punishment. If Lucas had committed a \"big corporate crime,\" however, he would still be free and the likely penalty would be some public shaming, a fine paid by his stockholders, and maybe some civil lawsuits against the corporation. Prison time would have been off the negotiating table.Viewed from a different perspective, federal prosecutors' de facto policy for crimes by big corporations -- \"big crimes\" -- is to bargain away executives' jail time for big corporate fines paid into the U.S. Treasury. Thus, federal prosecutors are now a major source of federal revenues.Prime examples of this \"corporate crimes pay\" policy are the five top U.S. banks whose criminal acts crashed the world economy 7 years ago. All paid billions in fines and not a single bank executive was jailed, let alone indicted. Indeed, none of these banks or their officials even admits any wrongdoing. They do, however, regularly get invitations to State Dinners at the White House, along with Congressional leaders from both Parties.U.S. policy on big crime, therefore, is secondarily about deterrence and increasingly about the federal government receiving big revenues through negotiated fines and candidates for federal office receiving massive PAC donations. In any other context, the practice would be called a \"shakedown.\"The pattern is clear. Consider these recent cases in the auto industry.1. Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors Corporation, which are part of the Hyundai Motor Group, one of the world's largest automakers, were fined a $100 million civil penalty in 2014 to resolve their Clean Air Violations on more than 1 million vehicles sold in the U.S. Executives of these companies had certified that these vehicles met EPA standards when they do not -- a criminal act.According to the EPA, these vehicles will collectively spew into the U.S. atmosphere an excess of 4.75 million metric tons of greenhouse gasses.Punishment consisted of the $100 million fine, forfeiture of Greenhouse gas emission credits, and a consent agreement in which the corporations promised not to repeat such criminal activity. No corporate executives were indicted.2. Toyota paid the federal government a $1.2 billion fine in 2014 to resolve its criminal act of concealing from safety regulators about engineering defects in various 2009 and 2010 models that experienced sudden acceleration and are linked to 5 deaths. Again, no corporate executives were indicted.3. In the summer of 2015, General Motors admitted that for a decade it had knowingly defrauded customers when it marketed as safe millions of vehicles that had a defective ignition switch. The defect led to the deaths of at least 120 people and injuries to more than 1,385. GM knowingly concealed this default from federal officials and filed false documents -- both of which are criminal acts.The Justice Department settled with GM for a $900 million fine. GM pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department also announced it had filed criminal charges against GM, but they would be dismissed in 36 months if the corporation \"fixed\" its recall processed. Yet again no GM executives were indicted for what was a decade of deadly criminal acts.4. Now comes Volkswagen. In late September 2015, Volkswagen acknowledged that it had committed diesel fraud in 11 million cars worldwide, including more than 500,000 in the United States. VW installed software in its engines that would detect emissions tests and rig the outcomes to appear in compliance with environmental laws. In reality, the VW engines were emitting 10 to 40 times the amount of gasses permitted under U.S. law. As with the other cases described herein, VW's deception, false reporting, and scheming to conceal its acts are criminal violations. Fines, shaming, and civil lawsuits are almost certain for VW. So too is the probability -- indeed almost certainty -- that no VW executive will ever serve a day of jail time for massively polluting the world and U.S. atmospheres.The lesson here is that \"little crime\" carries a personal liability while \"big crime\" does not. Any reform of the U.S. criminal justice system needs to correct this inequity.More to the point, the prospect of 17 ½ years in jail, as with Mr. Lucas, just might carry more of a deterrent effect with corporate leaders than a massive fine paid by their stockholders."}, {"title": "Name the Only Jaguar in the U.S. - Cast Your Vote", "text": "Forget Trump and Carson and Hillary and Bernie for a few minutes.

This week, leaders from business, government and society are meeting in New York City as part of Climate Week NYC to discuss what we as a country must do to reduce climate change, and preserve and empower our environment.   The ideas and commitments that emerge throughout Climate Week will shape the global dialogue taking place in Paris later this fall, during which there is hope to reach an international agreement on how to more positively inhabit our planet. No matter the specifics, a commitment at all levels - globally, nationally and even from individuals like you and me - is needed to ensure conversations yield actions and meaningful results.   For more than 30 years I have studied and worked with plants, and I am advocating that they be a key component of both domestic and global conservation policies. Even without my years of experience, it's easy to understand why plants are a critical piece of the climate puzzle.   Quite simply, we can't live without plants. Food, medicine, fiber, and fuel are just a few of the essentials plants provide. They also improve the quality of our lives. From the saguaro cacti of the Sonoran Desert, to the twisted pine trees of Poland's Crooked Forest, and the grass trees dotting the Australian bushland, plants are the heart of native landscapes that provide not only beauty, but also a sense of place.   This natural heritage is important for recreation, reflection, and spiritual enrichment. However, the ongoing impact of climate change is putting plant species at risk. Already, many are getting \"left behind,\" as they are unable to adjust their distribution fast enough to overcome the changing environment. But, plants are not optional. To avoid their destruction, they must be part of our climate conversation.   Whether human inflicted or natural disaster, when plant communities are destroyed, it can have devastating effects on the environment. It is essential to initiate restoration projects and begin replanting native plant seeds that provide endless benefits, including flood and erosion control, air and water purification, and carbon storage, among others. To meet these needs, the U.S. Department of the Interior recently released the \"National Seed Strategy for Rehabilitation and Restoration.\" It's a simple vision that will have critical impact: use the right seed in the right place at the right time to protect and restore our native habitats.   Although the Strategy represents a much-needed step to improve plant restoration on both public and private lands, we must now take it from idea to action - engaging a nationwide network of seed collectors and restoration ecologists to make this vision a reality.   Similarly, we must take our broader climate conversations from word to action by engaging leaders at the national and international levels, and with help from citizen scientists like you. One of the coolest aspects of plants is that they're accessible to everyone, and it's easy for nearly anyone to make a difference. There are many ways you can help, for example, by:  • Monitoring plants and recording your findings. Project BudBurst is a national campaign co-managed by Chicago Botanic Garden and the National Ecological Observatory Network. People of all ages and abilities can get involved with the program by documenting their observations of the leafing, flowering, and fruiting phases of plants throughout all four seasons. Participants then share their findings in a public record that is accessible to scientists and educators who use the data to learn more about how plants respond to climate changes.  • Volunteering to help plan and restore native habitats. The United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service offers many initiatives where volunteers help agency personnel plan and accomplish restoration projects and other important types of conservation work.   Open, forward thinking, such as the examples I've outlined here, are exactly the types of ideas we need to continue to embrace in the U.S. and at a global level. If we can drive policy and action that encourage national and international collaboration, engages citizen scientists, and puts the focus on Mother Nature's natural defenses, such as plants, we can help make a greener and cleaner future a reality."}, {"title": "Obama Outlines What Success At Paris Climate Conference Would Look Like", "text": "President Barack Obama is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the prospect of a global climate agreement emerging from negotiations in Paris at the end of this year.Heading into the conference, he said in an interview with Rolling Stone's Jeff Goodell published Wednesday, \"we're now in a position for the first time to have all countries recognize their responsibilities to tackle the problem, and to have a meaningful set of targets as well as the financing required to help poor countries adapt.\"World leaders will meet in Paris in December to continue negotiations toward an international climate pact. More than 60 countries have already offered individual emission reduction targets as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but the Paris summit is expected to be where countries will finalize and formalize a binding international agreement.Obama said he recognizes the targets individual countries have offered so far aren't strong enough, but he believes they are a starting point.\"[T]he science keeps on telling us we're just not acting fast enough,\" he said. \"My attitude, though, is that if we get the structure right, then we can turn the dials as there's additional public education, not just in the United States but across the world, and people feel a greater urgency about it and there's more political will to act.\"\"[T]he key for Paris is just to make sure that everybody is locked in, saying, 'We're going to do this,'\" Obama continued. \"Once we get to that point, then we can turn the dials. But there will be a momentum that is built, and I'm confident that we will then be in a position to listen more carefully to the science -- partly because people, I think, will be not as fearful of the consequences or as cynical about what can be achieved. Hope builds on itself. Success breeds success.\"Goodell sat down with Obama during the president's trip to Alaska last month, which the writer describes as \"mostly a calculated and well-crafted presidential publicity stunt\" but one that the administration used to call attention to climate change, an issue it sees as imperative to Obama's legacy.Obama described the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks, which had also been expected to yield an international climate accord, as \"a disorganized mess.\" After two weeks of negotiations, leaders still had not come to any agreement.\"I still remember flying in that last day, and nothing was happening, and I literally had to rescue the entire enterprise by crashing a meeting of the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India and China] and strong-arming them into coming up with at least a document that could build some consensus going into the future,\" Obama said.Six years later, there's more hope that leaders will finally reach a formal agreement. Obama said much has changed since then, citing bilateral work with China, India and Brazil. Obama is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping again later this week, and climate change is expected to be a top topic for the leaders of the world's two biggest emitters.In the wide-ranging interview, Obama also touches on the failures of cap-and-trade, why his administration approved Arctic drilling, and his outlook on the prospects of stopping catastrophic climate change.Read the full interview in Rolling Stone."}, {"title": "No, The 'Blood Moon' Doesn't Mean Doomsday Is Here", "text": "Here's some welcome news for anyone who is worried--as some fundamentalists might be--that the upcoming \"blood moon\" means the world is coming to an end:It isn't.Astronomically speaking, \"there is no such thing as a 'blood moon,'\" Dr. Jay Pasachoff, an astronomer at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., told The Huffington Post in an email. People who use that term are either \"misguided or malicious,\" he added.The moon will look reddish for a brief time on the night of Sept. 27-28. But that's only because the moon will be cast into shadow as the Earth passes between it and the sun--in other words, we're set to see a lunar eclipse.In the U.S., the eclipse will begin at 9:07 p.m. E.T. and will last for more than three hours. What astronomers call \"totality\"--when the moon is fully enveloped within the Earth's shadow--will begin at 10:11 p.m. and last for 72 minutes.Fair enough. But why exactly will the moon take on that crimson cast?In a new video (above) posted on its website, NASA suggests a simple thought experiment can make it all clear:Using your imagination, fly to the Moon and stand inside a dusty lunar crater. Look up. Overhead hangs Earth, nightside facing you, completely hiding the sun behind it. The eclipse is underway. You might suppose that the Earth overhead would be completely dark. After all, you're looking at the nightside of our planet. Instead, something amazing happens. When the sun is located directly behind Earth, the rim of the planet seems to catch fire! The darkened terrestrial disk is ringed by every sunrise and every sunset in the world, all at once. This light filters into the heart of Earth's shadow, suffusing it with a coppery glow. Back on Earth, the shadowed Moon becomes a great red orb.In more scientific terms, the moon looks red during a lunar eclipse because of Rayleigh scattering. That's a phenomenon in which sunlight--essentially a mash-up of all the different colors of light--is scattered by Earth's atmosphere. Since blue light is scattered more than red light, it's essentially \"filtered out\" as it passes through the atmosphere--leaving red light to reach the moon.You don't need any special equipment to see a lunar eclipse. But watching the action unfold with a telescope or binoculars will add to the fun. As astronomer Phil Plait wrote recently on Slate, \"The moon can take on an odd three-dimensional appearance when you use binoculars during an eclipse, and it's pretty cool to see.\"This is the last total lunar eclipse until 2018, according to Sky & Telescope. So enjoy the show!Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the relative positions of the Earth, moon, and sun that occur during a lunar eclipse."}, {"title": "Selfie Accidents Have Killed More People Than Sharks This Year", "text": "Selfie-related accidents have killed more people worldwide this year than shark attacks have, and they’ve killed at least twice as many if you include only “unprovoked,” confirmed shark attacks.Conde Nast Traveler reported on Sept. 16 that 11 people had died during selfie accidents, while eight people worldwide were killed in shark attacks. The story picked up steam with the recent death of a tourist who fell down the stairs at the Taj Mahal while trying to snap a selfie, bringing the tally up to 12. Mashable created an infographic to illustrate how much deadlier careless selfies are compared to shark attacks.Conde Nast Traveler got its figures from the Shark Attack Survivors news archives, but, George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said those archives don't take the circumstances of shark encounters into consideration.Burgess said that only six, rather than eight, fatal shark attacks should be counted in the tally, because in one of the incidents it's not clear if the shark may have been \"provoked,\" and the other may not have even been a shark attack.Burgess classifies one of the attacks in the SAS news archives as \"provoked\" because it involved a diver carrying a bag of scallops, which worked as bait to attract a shark. He also pointed to another alleged attack, which was actually a case of a man who disappeared at sea. Though his body showed up later with wounds consistent with shark bites, it wasn't clear if he died in a shark attack, or whether sharks had scavenged on his body after he died.Though the Conde Nast Traveler and Mashable articles don't detail the 12 selfie-related deaths, they are listed on Wikpedia:1. An American woman fell to her death while taking a selfie with her boyfriend on a cliff in South Africa.There is, however, some evidence that there may be other selfie-related deaths that we don't know about because they didn't make international headlines. Yelena Alexeyeva, an aide to the Russian interior minister, told the Agency France-Presse in July that there have been “dozens of selfie-related deaths” in Russia alone.According to Burgess, the media’s focus on shark attacks gives the public a warped idea of how dangerous they really are, since every time a shark attack happens, it’s a major news story -- unlike fatalities resulting from more common tragedies, such as car accidents.“I see it as a problem for our understanding of society and understanding sharks and the natural environment,” he said.Burgess noted that whether shark attacks have killed six or eight people this year, or whatever the hard numbers on selfie-related deaths may be, the real story is that sharks should be much more worried about humans than the other way around.“The fact of the matter is we’re killing between 30 and 70 million sharks a year in fisheries,” Burgess said. “The real aggressor in this relationship isn’t the shark, it’s the human.”Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.comAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "An Open Letter to Ellen DeGeneres: Please Remember Animals", "text": "Dear Ellen,As a teenager, I looked up to you as an example of a media figure who put good into the world and made it your mission to embody positive values in our culture. Attitudes around LGBT rights were beginning to shift, and you served as the jovial but unapologetic face of equality. You made people smile and posed necessary, sometimes uncomfortable, questions that forced America to evaluate its deeply held prejudices. (Who can forget the exchanges you had with Sen. John McCain and Caitlyn Jenner about marriage equality?)Your brand included an acknowledgement that equality extended beyond the bounds of species. You became a vegan and quickly took it upon yourself to let others know that exploiting animals was, without exception, an unacceptable option. You used your website, talk show and even wedding to forward the values of animal rights. \"They're all in pain. They're all treated badly [...] I saw the reality and I couldn't ignore it anymore [...] Every time you think of what's on your plate, what it was, you just can't do it,\" you told Katie Couric in a sit-down about animal rights.

Fans are bewildered by your abandonment of what they thought were deeply-held personal values.\"Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin,\" you're quoted as saying on the ED by Ellen website. I couldn't agree more. I'd like to echo People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and ask you: \"Whose skin are you in?\" I explain in my petition, which I hope reaches your desk:\"Cows used for leather are castrated, burned, dehorned and generally tortured. Pigs have their tails cut off, ears mutilated and testicles cut out. All of these awful procedures happen without painkillers, not that any of them would be okay either way.The exploitation of animals for food, clothing, entertainment, testing and other totally unnecessary forms of consumption is something that each of us should categorically reject. And we vote for or against animals each time we go to the grocery store or purchase a new addition to our wardrobes.To fully realize equality, we must first ask ourselves if the way we're treating the most vulnerable among us reflects a dedication to the respect of sentient life. Our speciesist attitudes are a symptom of the same misguided instincts that have caused us to enslave and exploit members of the human species.We have a responsibility to become the change we want to see in the world. Those of us who take our values seriously can't allow anyone to co-opt the language of advocates to forward their own interests while hypocritically profiting from the very exploitation they've paid lip-service to condemning.

Pope Francis's first visit to the United States marks a spiritual moment that brings an intense focus to the world's neediest people. His arrival comes just as the new Sustainable Development Goals are about to be formalized. Then, in just three months, the world will likely unite around the first-ever global climate agreement in Paris.When we look back at this time, perhaps we'll see this as the moment when previously unacknowledged connections became crystal clear: our moral responsibility to take care of the poor dovetails precisely with the need to care for our planet. Both, in turn, are part of our spiritual journey here on Earth.That's the main theme of the pope's message to the U.S. Congress, the United Nations and millions of others -- to Roman Catholics and far beyond.The pope's encyclical letter on the environment, Laudato Si, makes the case for \"the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet\" and speaks of the pope's conviction that \"everything in the world is connected.\"\"The human environment and the natural environment deteriorate together; we cannot adequately combat environmental degradation unless we attend to causes related to human and social degradation,\" Pope Francis says in the encyclical. At his White House speech on September 23, he built on this theme, speaking of our need to invest in our \"common home\". Failure to protect God's good creation for future generations is a sign of moral and social failure. In an earlier post, I describe these issues in more detail.The pope is addressing the UN just two days before the final approval of the SDGs and just 10 weeks before the Paris climate summit. Both the new SDGs and the growing momentum on climate change center on the idea that economic growth and environmental protection are inextricably linked; they are in essence two sides of a coin.The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 stretch targets for the period 2015-2030. Unlike the Millennium Development Goals they replace, they cover all countries, not just the developing world, and recognize that the old model of one-way assistance - following from developed governments to developing ones - has outlived its usefulness. All countries have responsibilities in this globalized world, and the private sector and civil society are recognized as a central part of progress.The SDGs seek to integrate economic, social and environmental issues. Thus, for example, they call for universal access to electricity for all by 2030, which will be enabled by a doubling of the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and a massive increase in renewable energy. They call for a new urban paradigm, in which people rather than automobiles will be the focus of investment, creating more compact, connected and resilient cities, which will in turn help address climate change and promote economic competitiveness. They call for a halving of food waste, which will improve food security for the poor, take pressure off forests and help close the carbon gap. They call for landscape restoration, which will bring carbon back down to Earth, in turn bringing improved agricultural yields, higher incomes for poor farmers, and greater resilience.These goals are naively optimistic. They will require a shift in the allocation of resources, rather than a massive injection of new financial resources. Many of these measures - such as a new approach to urbanization -- will save trillions of dollars in investment over the next 15 years. Many others - energy, landscape restoration, etc. - will require increased up-front resources, but will pay for themselves quickly.If the SDGs were implemented fully, climate change would be largely solved, even though climate would not be the primary motivator. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (of which the World Resources Institute in the managing partner), has shown that there is a path forward that will enable us to move from today's high carbon/low efficiency world economy to tomorrow's low carbon/high efficiency economy in a manner that promotes both societal and economic benefits.These ideas are slowly taking root, and the next few weeks are critical. We are on the verge of a great opportunity. And leaders of governments, corporations, cities, communities and religions have a historic opportunity to shift behavior and forge a better future."}, {"title": "Why Is Managing Fish in the World's Oceans Like an Episode of <i>I Love Lucy</i>?", "text": "Fish scientist Jason Link says he often feels like he's living the classic chocolate factory episode of the 1950s TV show I Love Lucy, in which Lucy and Ethel can't wrap candies as fast as the conveyor belt spits them out.\"It's analogous to fisheries management,\" says Link, whose mission at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) is to improve how ocean resources are regulated. \"We're trying to keep up with rules on individual species whose populations are frequently changing. Our conveyor belt is moving faster and faster.\"Jason Link (left) and Peter Auster, science director at Northeast Underwater Research Technology & Education Center at the University of Connecticut, hold barndoor skates while on the research vessel Albatross IV during a scientific mission on Georges Bank, off the New England coast.Link's job--similar to mine at The Pew Charitable Trusts--is to advocate for a more effective, efficient approach to setting fishing rules, one that takes a big picture view. Instead of establishing catch limits on one species at a time, Link and I want decision-makers to focus on the ecosystem and consider what fish eat, what eats them, their habitat needs, and other conditions that affect fish populations. Our mission is to persuade people that a method called ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is the way to go.\"We've been managing fisheries on a species-by-species basis. We haven't been looking at the way that fish and other marine life interact with one another and the impacts on the broader system of removing one or more species from the mix,\" said Link, whom I've known for 10 years. \"It's really clear we're missing information that could improve the way we're managing ocean ecosystems. The oceans are constantly changing. We need adaptive management tools to be able to handle these shifts, particularly climate change.\"Link became interested in the ocean as a child when he found it fun to memorize the scientific names of sea creatures. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in biology from Central Michigan University and a doctorate in biological sciences from Michigan Technological University.After graduation, he debated whether to pursue a career in academia or a more hands-on scientific path. His choice became a little clearer after he attended both an academic conference and a fisheries meeting. At the conference, he engaged in research talk and was handed a pass for a wine and cheese reception followed by a ballet performance. The fisheries meeting featured on-the-water stories and a casual happy hour.And so the down-to-earth outdoorsman chose what felt right. He's been with NOAA Fisheries for nearly 20 years, now in a position focused solely on promoting and researching ecosystem-based management. From his base at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he spreads his message across the country to fishing groups, fishery leaders, academics, conservationists, scientists, and anyone else who will listen. He reports that most people agree that we need to shift to EBFM--but have questions on how to get it done.Jason Link stands on the research vessel Gloria Michelle after docking in Woods Hole, Mass.\"The perception is that the technical basis for doing EBFM is beyond us. However, there are actually tools and methods that can allow us to implement it,\" says Link, who spent many years working on computer models that map out food webs to show how predators and prey interact. Link, who moves fluidly from discussing dense science with experts to using simpler language to carry his message, recently teamed up with a colleague to identify other misconceptions about EBFM in an article in the journal Fisheries, \"Myths That Continue to Impede Progress in Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management.\" It may not have been this summer's sizzling beach read, but in fish circles this was hot stuff.1. Myth: No one knows what EBFM is or how to get it done. Fact: The concept is getting more traction and is already in practice in some places. For example, protecting habitat or fish spawning sites are ways to implement EBFM.2. Myth: The existing fishery management system has to change dramatically to incorporate EBFM. Fact: More than 90 federal rules already allow for EBFM, and there is nothing to stop fish managers from incorporating it.3. Myth: There's not enough scientific information on the ecosystem to know how to manage fisheries in a way that minimizes impacts to the environment. Fact: It's not necessary to know every detail. The key is to consider more factors about the ecosystem--beyond just the status of one species--when setting fishing rules.4. Myth: EBFM means fishermen will be allowed to catch fewer fish. Fact: EBFM will improve the health of ecosystems, leading to more catch and stability in regulations and the economy.5. Myth: This management theory is a naive attempt to steward fisheries in a contentious, political, and complex system. Fact: EBFM is pragmatic because it helps managers meet objectives of multiple parties through an improved system of balancing trade-offs and the needs of all parties.6. Myth: There aren't enough resources to make EBFM happen. Fact: There is evidence to suggest that EBFM may actually reduce administrative complexity and the costs of fisheries management.Put simply, Link says, EBFM should help address fishery issues that are only growing more complicated.Taking the I Love Lucy comparison further he explains the importance of seeing the big picture. \"Maybe chocolate isn't the only thing to worry about. Maybe we also have to deal with licorice or gum drops. And the room is warming. And the chocolate is melting, and there are more people coming into the room to eat it.\"It's food analogies like this that help Link connect with his audiences. He's feeding his EBFM message to people far and wide. And I hope everyone is hungry to learn, because ecosystem-based fisheries management can help conserve our ocean resources while providing abundant fishing opportunities and seafood for generations to come."}, {"title": "Leading Special Forces for Sustainability: How Peter Bakker and the WBCSD Isolate, Take Action, and Deliver Measurable Impacts on 9 Global Priorities, Part 1", "text": "Part 1 - Leading Special Forces for Sustainability, A Conversation with Mr. Peter Bakker, President and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development\"I saw the limitations of one company,\" Peter Bakker reflected when asked about what drives his passion to align global business leaders toward creating a better world.Mr. Bakker, who has for the past three and a half years served as President and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), understands well the contradiction of power and humility felt by so many CEOs.\"Doom and gloom simply is not part of my persona,\"he remarked. \"Humanity is running out of time. The science on global climate and ecosystem change has progressed a great deal and we now know it's undeniable that humanity needs to act swiftly. As a problem-solver I've always been driven by asking, what are the solutions business can deliver? what barriers need to be circumvented? how can global business concerns be scaled-up to deliver solutions, drive measurable impacts, and in collaboration with multilateral organizations and stakeholders. This is a systems-challenge, one that requires unwavering commitment and leadership. I've always felt compelled to take this challenge head-on.\"It takes a unique kind of leader, thinker, and doer to have the personal will to immerse themselves into large-scale global issues and simultaneously lead with impact. In my recent conversation with Mr. Bakker he revealed how the WBCSD is creating action-oriented teams of committed CEOs who are, as he was a few years ago, eager to extend their reach, leverage their resources, and act upon complex global challenges with the fervor of a Special Forces team.More than 17% of the world's population, some 1.3 billion people, have no access to electricity. Think about that for a moment in the context of your daily life. Every text message, Tweet, Facebook like, Instagram post, sip of java, late night snack, and trip to the grocery store requires electricity -- and a lot of it. Electricity not only jolts our fast paced lifestyle, it also powers facilities, infrastructure, and systems critical to the health and wellbeing of billions of people worldwide.Developed nations have come to rely heavily on electricity as a lifeline, a ubiquitous commodity valued as a common, just like the air and water which enable life. Yet as billions of bytes of data change hands every second in the developed world, a very significant portion of the world's population lives in relative darkness, unconnected and unable to access electricity, a commodity now considered by a majority of humanity to be essential to basic survival.Earlier this month, Johannesburg, South Africa stood as the backdrop as the WBCSD formally launched its innovative microgrids program, an integral component of their Low Carbon Technology Partnerships initiative (LCTPi). The WBCSD's microgrids program is designed to accelerate the scaled-up deployment of low-carbon microgrid solutions by offering customers localized, clean, reliable and proven energy generation and systems.Placing emphasis on achieving scale, collaboration, and action, the WBCSD will be launching additional programs within their LCTPi throughout the world in the next few weeks. The targeted effort, known as the Action2020 Climate Dialogues, has been designed to mobilize resources and provide a clear framework for businesses to take action on region-specific sustainable development priorities around the world.For example, the LCTPi, which is supported by the French Presidency of COP21 (the UN's climate conference), is being put into action by the WBCSD, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The LCTPi initiative is laser-focused on establishing the policy and financial instruments that need to be in place to accelerate the diffusion of existing, low-carbon technologies while also nurturing relationships to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy (RDD&D) new technologies through public-private partnerships (PPPs).In advance of the upcoming COP21 Paris negotiations, the WBCSD is taking swift effort to rally leaders of consequence and character to collaborate on the development of low-carbon solutions that can address the impacts of climate change now.Mr. Bakker stated, \"the Action2020 initiative lays out nine key priorities that require urgent attention. The WBCSD worked with more than 800 scientists to define these priorities, and assign outcome-based and measurable opportunities for engaging business to address these global challenges.\"The nine priorities defined by Action2020 include: climate change, release of nutrient elements, ecosystems, exposure to harmful substances, water, basic needs and rights, skills and employment, sustainable lifestyles, and food, feed, fibre, and biofuels. Under Peter Bakker's leadership the WBCSD, its members, and partners are creating action plans for each of these nine areas.Mr. Bakker noted, \"in the Action2020 Climate Dialogs we are hosting a series of global roundtables, in India, Brazil, China, Australia, the U.S., and elsewhere, garnering representation from key stakeholder groups to discuss the action plans developed for LCTPi, aiming to have each action plan signed-off by CEOs who are committed to take action and see the plan through.\"During our conversation Mr. Bakker provided further insight to the WBCSD's LCTPi and microgrid program recently launched in Johannesburg. In particular, he emphasized the strategy his team is implementing to empower and engage world business leaders to collaborate on market-based solutions for sustainable development. He revealed that leaders from ABB, Alstom, EDF, Engie, Eskom, First Solar, and Schneider Electric have assembled a microgrids working group to specifically address the sustainable energy needs of countries like South Africa.This level of commitment and accountability is hopeful, particularly since attaining sustainability has been, at best, a winding journey for some, and an elusive and empty goal for most, governments and businesses.Mr. Bakker further pointed out, \"the converging issues are very complex. When you look at serving the needs of 7.3 billion people while impacting issues such as climate, it's outright overwhelming. Even those with significant resources and intellect struggle on where to begin. This is where the WBCSD and our Action2020 initiative has fit in. We are working with business leaders to self-select those solutions they can bring to scale across the nine priorities and have clear, measurable impact.\""}, {"title": "This Octogenarian Took In Dozens Of Abandoned Dogs And Built Them A Mini-Train", "text": "Eugene Bostick may have officially retired about 15 years ago, but in some ways that was when his most impactful work began.Not long after, he embarked on a new career path of sorts — as a train conductor for rescued stray dogs."}, {"title": "The Pope Smokes Out Congress on Climate Change", "text": "The funniest line of the last few days came from Arizona's Republican Congressman Paul Gosar.Resentful that Pope Francis might blaspheme the sacred chamber of the World's Greatest Deliberative Body with some inconvenient truth about global warming, Gosar announced he would boycott the Holy Father's visit to Capitol Hill. He then declared, \"If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time.\"Now that's funny. Not intentionally funny because this is a member of the House of Representatives who says many silly things and actually means them. Like the time earlier this year when he told a town hall that the cash from Social Security and other government benefits that undocumented immigrants allegedly were sending home made up the second largest component of Mexico's gross domestic product. Who told the White Mountain Apache tribe, \"You're still wards of the federal government.\" A man who, though Catholic, won't give the pope the time of day but once accepted the endorsement of controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio and drove to Nevada to declare his support for right-wing lawbreaker and racist Cliven Bundy.Also, I wonder, what exactly does Rep. Gosar imagine the pope usually does with \"his personal time?\" Catch up on his Netflix? Chow down at Olive Garden with his Never Ending Pasta Pass? Head to the rifle range for some target practice?Instead, I'm guessing thoughtful prayer and meditation. (And come to think of it, what personal time?)You can argue that a joint session of Congress is an inappropriate speaking venue for a world religious leader, violation of church and state and so forth. And many of us have big, big issues with the Roman Catholic Church. As journalist and climate activist Wen Stephenson writes in the current issue of The Nation:However sincere and compassionate he may be (and he appears to be both), in his role as the pope he's a politician, a world leader at the head of a rich, powerfully influential, and entirely human -- that is, deeply fallible -- global institution. And he presides over a conservative theological tradition whose teachings on gender, sexuality, marriage, contraception, and abortion are, to many of us, and women in particular, not only wrong but oppressive. For these and other reasons, his ability to single-handedly reshape climate politics, especially in this country, is limited, to say the least...Frankly, despite the separation of church and state argument, this is no time for business -- or politics -- as usual. And months before his Capitol Hill address, the pontiff demonstrated that he had Congress' number. \"We lack leadership capable of striking out on new paths and meeting the needs of the present with concern for all and without prejudice towards coming generations,\" he wrote in his June encyclical Laudato si' (On Care for Our Common Home). \"The failure of global summits on the environment make it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected.\"Example: last week's revelations from the Pulitzer Prize-winning website Inside Climate News. Their eight-month investigation, including extensive interviews and access to internal documents demonstrates that as early as 1977, Exxon Corporation was warned that \"carbon dioxide from the world's use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.\"The petrochemical giant \"assembled a brain trust that would spend more than a decade deepening the company's understanding of an environmental problem that posed an existential threat to the oil business.\" They seem to have been decent corporate citizens -- especially compared to today. The head of theoretical sciences at Exxon Corporate Research Laboratories even wrote, in 1982, that their \"ethical responsibility is to permit the publication of our research in the scientific literature. Indeed to do otherwise would be a breach of Exxon's public position and ethical credo on honesty and integrity.\"And so they did publish, but then, according to the Inside Climate News investigative team:Toward the end of the 1980s, Exxon curtailed its carbon dioxide research. In the decades that followed, Exxon worked instead at the forefront of climate denial. It put its muscle behind efforts to manufacture doubt about the reality of global warming its own scientists had once confirmed. It lobbied to block federal and international action to control greenhouse gas emissions. It helped to erect a vast edifice of misinformation that stands to this day.And so it goes. \"The alliance between the economy and technology ends up sidelining anything unrelated to its immediate interests,\" the pope wrote in his climate encyclical. \"Consequently the most one can expect is superficial rhetoric, sporadic acts of philanthropy and perfunctory expressions of concern for the environment, whereas any genuine attempt by groups within society to introduce change is viewed as a nuisance based on romantic illusions or an obstacle to be circumvented.\"An obstacle to be circumvented -- which brings us back around to the GOP of Paul Gosar and his ilk. Just two weeks ago, Politico's Andrew Restuccia reported:Top Republican lawmakers are planning a wide-ranging offensive -- including outreach to foreign officials by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office -- to undermine President Barack Obama's hopes of reaching an international climate change agreement that would cement his environmental legacy.It is not for nothing that since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the gas and oil industry has contributed more than $1.8 million to McConnell (and it's not for nothing that in the short time since 2010, when he was first elected to the House, Paul Gosar has collected nearly $200,000 from the energy and natural resources sector).Joe Romm of the indispensable Climate Progress blog wrote:McConnell's actions end the pretense that the GOP leadership has any interest whatsoever in trying to globally address the gravest preventable threat America faces... I'm not sure a major political leader has ever pursued a strategy that is so directly counter to the health and well-being of all Americans, their children, and the next 50 generations.It is cynical, hypocritical, mercenary and willfully destructive: many things this pope seems not to be. By all means, let him speak to Congress. When it comes to climate change, he will be a breath of fresh, unpolluted air."}, {"title": "A Week That Builds Momentum for Bold Climate Action", "text": "We are at a moment of important progress in the fight against climate change. From Pope Francis' speech in Congress to President Obama's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders are focused on climate action. And tens of thousands of people will show their support by rallying both in DC and New York.Confronting climate change is a marathon race, but we are at a moment of acceleration.This burst of energy couldn't come soon enough. Scientists just reported the summer was the hottest on record. Soaring temperatures intensified drought, left farmers struggling to keep crops alive and fueled deadly wildfires. Extreme heat also contributed to smoggier air, putting people at risk of asthma attacks and other health hazards.Climate change is threatening our communities right now, yet many Republican leaders in Congress ignore the crisis. They claim America shouldn't act on climate alone and they are attempting to undermine the upcoming international climate talks in Paris. But the truth is that America is not acting alone - we are part of a wave of strong climate action around the world from China to India and from national leaders to mayors, businesses and citizens.This week re-confirms that GOP leaders are on the wrong side of history. They risk alienating the vast majority of Americans who support government measures to clean up carbon pollution (demonstrated in poll after poll after poll).Most people are looking for climate leadership and four events this week will help deliver it.The Pope Addresses Leaders: In speaking to Congress and the UN General Assembly, Pope Francis is building on his Encyclical where he laid out our moral obligation to shield people from the ravages of climate change, especially the most vulnerable among us. The pope has criticized politicians for their slow response to the climate threat and called on them to be \"courageous\" and look beyond \"the mindset of short-term gain.\" Just this morning at the White House, Pope Francis said, \"Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation. To use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King, we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it.\"Citizens Rally for Climate Action: When the pope speaks to Congress on Thursday, tens of tens of thousands will gather on the Mall to show the broad support for climate action and climate justice. People of all faiths and all walks of life will join the rally, and many leaders will speak to the crowd, including my terrific NRDC colleague Aliya Haq who will make a strong case for U.S. leadership and the power of citizen action. Similarly tens of thousands are expected in New York to honor the Pope's call for climate action.Presidents of US/China Talk Climate Change: President Obama will host President Xi Jinping at the White House to discuss issues including climate change. Despite what Republican leaders claim, China is already taking strong climate action. It has committed to reducing the carbon intensity of its economy by roughly 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and is halfway there. China also plans to increase its share of non-fossil-fuel energy to 15 percent by 2020. As a part of the Paris climate agreement they will commit to do even more including peaking its carbon dioxide no later than 2030. And China is already reducing its coal consumption and has twice as much solar online as we do in the United States.World Leaders Gather at the UN: Climate change will be a central focus of the General Assembly in New York later this week. Delegates will adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals, which include clean energy and climate mitigation targets. And they will clarify elements of the forthcoming Paris agreement. Several countries will likely announce commitments for reducing their own carbon pollution. Already nations accounting for more than 60 percent of emissions--including China and the US--have announced post-2020 targets, and the remaining big emitters, such as India, are expected to do so soon.These and other developments set the stage for a strong agreement and commitments from cities, states, businesses and organizations worldwide to come out of Paris. They keep the drumbeat going for steady progress and hope for our future."}, {"title": "Volkswagen May Never Recover From This Mess", "text": "It took Volkswagen years to build its reputation in the United States as a hip, countercultural brand -- so cool that an ad for the company is used in an episode of \"Mad Men\" to signal the fast-changing advertising landscape.That carefully cultivated brand quickly lost its magic after the Environmental Protection Agency charged the automaker with purposefully designing software for Volkswagen diesel vehicles that skirted environmental regulations.On Wednesday, chief executive Martin Winterkorn announced he would step down from the company in the wake of the scandal. \"As CEO I accept responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines,\" he said in a statement. \"Volkswagen needs a fresh start -- also in terms of personnel. I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation.\"Volkswagen’s brand perception plummeted into negative territory this week -- meaning more people are hearing bad things about the automaker than good things -- for the first time in six years, according to new data from YouGov's BrandIndex, which tracks consumers views on various companies.Though automakers have a long history of trying to skirt environmental regulations -- indeed, VW was fined in 1973 for installing cheat devices, notes The New York Times -- the large scale of the issue this time and the brazen failure of the company to live up to its environmentally savvy reputation could be devastating.\"If VW gets its reputation back, it will be clawing up the side of a very high mountain,\" said Thomas Donaldson, a professor of business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, referring to the scandal as a \"corporate Watergate.\" When a company openly admits to the buying public -- a group it is trying to build trust with -- that it’s been cheating, that’s difficult to come back from.The costs to the company may far exceed the approximately $7 billion its set aside to pay for its mistake. So far, its stock price has plummeted. But the big issue is future sales. VW just this year surpassed Toyota as the world’s largest automaker by sales -- but this scandal is clearly going to cost them customers.\"I’ll never entertain another Volkswagen again,\" said Tom Farmer, who lives in the Seattle area and leases a diesel Jetta partly because of its environmental credentials. He’s counting down the months until his lease runs out, he told The Huffington Post, echoing a chorus of betrayed VW owners.Kevin Foster loved his 2013 Beetle, his first diesel, so much that he named it Beatrice. \"I believe in global warming and I thought I was doing my part to help succeeding generations,\" Foster, an engineer who lives in northern Tennessee, told HuffPost. \"And it has all been a lie.\"It’s not clear if the automaker will ever recover its good name. A longtime company insider and the highest-paid CEO in Germany, the 68-year-old Winterkorn is known to be extremely attentive to details; his organization was run in a very top-down, centralized manner.\"I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part,\" Winterkorn said during his statement on Wednesday.We don’t know if that's true or if he knew about the cheat devices -- but in the end, it did not matter.\"You may not have known about the iceberg, but you still need to be looking for it,\" Donaldson said.Winterkorn dutifully delivered his apology the day before he stepped down. \"I’m very sorry, I’m utterly sorry,\" he said in a video statement, a stunning acknowledgement that the automaker had knowingly cheated its customers.\"Manipulation at VW must never happen again,\" Winterkorn said on Tuesday. \"I am endlessly sorry that we betrayed the trust. I apologize profusely to our clients, to the authorities and the entire public for the wrongdoing.\"Volkswagen said on Tuesday that as many as 11 million vehicles were installed with the cheat software. The program was engineered to sense when emissions were being tested. When there was no testing going on, emissions of nitrogen oxide were 40 times the legal limit. The chemical leads to smog, which is connected with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, as HuffPost's Jo Confino reported Monday.For much of 2014, VW officials told regulators that the emissions issues with the diesel cars were just a glitch, according to The Wall Street Journal.A New York Times graphic explains how it worked:The device appears to be relatively simple, but the fallout is going to be exceedingly complex. The New York State attorney general, along with his peers in other states, are investigating; the Federal Trade Commission, too, may begin an inquiry. Customers are looking for payback.The German government has also launched an investigation into VW, and YouGov found that the company's perception has suffered even more in its home country.A task force led by an external investigator is also prepared to look into the case, VW announced Wednesday.Still, automakers have proven to be a resilient group. It took Toyota a little more than a year to recover its brand perception after it faced a huge cover-up scandal over cars that suddenly accelerated, killing passengers, said a representative from YouGov.In the end, the VW situation may actually be worse than Toyota's, which didn't intentionally design vehicles to fail, Donaldson said.But buyers have been through this before, and some won't be put off by this scandal -- sticking by a company with a reputation for making safe, quality cars.\"When a company says to the people it is trying to build trust with that it's been cheating,\" that's particularly egregious, Donaldson said. \"What takes years to cultivate can be destroyed in the blink of an eye.\""}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders Really Likes What Pope Francis Is All About", "text": "Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) can't seem to hold back his excitement about Pope Francis, the Catholic leader widely heralded for his commitment to social issues.Though Sanders' praise of Pope Francis is nothing new, he's taken many opportunities to reiterate his support since the pope's arrival to the United States Tuesday afternoon. In a floor speech that took place just as the pope was landing in Washington, the senator and Democratic presidential hopeful lauded Pope Francis for \"speaking out with courage and brilliance about some of the most important issues facing our world.\" The speech went on for 11 minutes.Later Tuesday, in an interview with with MSNBC's Chris Hayes, Sanders said he believed Pope Francis \"has played just an extraordinary and brilliant and courageous role on this planet over the last several years.\"\"He's dealing with issues that very few people in Congress are prepared to deal with,\" Sanders said.The senator admitted that he disagrees with Pope Francis on women's right to choose and marriage equality, but said the pope's stance on climate change has been \"hugely important.\" He referenced Pope Francis' 192-page encyclical on the environment in which the pontiff called climate change the Earth's response to the “irresponsible use and abuse of the goods that God placed in her.”\"That is a profound statement which I see already having a significant impact on the debate,\" he told Hayes.Sanders continued his praise Wednesday morning in a CNN interview prior to the pope's arrival at the White House, saying the the Catholic leader has reached beyond the church \"to people all over the world, and with an incredibly strong message of social justice.\"\"He is saying that as a planet, as a people we have got to do better,\" Sanders said, touting the pope's progressive agenda.\"He's looking in the eyes of the wealthiest people of this country... and he's saying, 'You know what, you cannot continue to ignore the needs of the poor, you cannot continue to ignore the needs of the sick.'\"The support mounted in a Wednesday Facebook post, in which Sanders said Pope Francis' contributions go beyond his push for climate action and addressing economic inequality.\"He is asking us to become a different kind of person, where our happiness and well-being comes from serving others and being part of the human community,\" Sanders wrote."}, {"title": "Toddler Tries To Take 80-Pound Dog For A Walk, Failure Ensues", "text": "Dogs and kids make excellent cuddle buddies, but when it comes to getting up and walking around, they may not be so well matched.This adorable video shows an 11-month-old boy attempting to take his English bulldog Bernie for a walk.

As we made our way along the back roads of the Champlain Valley over the next few days, our numbers began to swell. By the time we reached Burlington, over a thousand people had joined the march -- a practical revolution in our small state, and enough to convince every candidate running for federal office to sign onto our demand to cut carbon \"80% by 2050.\"I have many fond memories from the march, but one of the most meaningful is of a sermon that Bill gave at a church in Charlotte, Vermont on the second to last day of our journey. As an agnostic kid from Cambridge, Massachusetts, churches weren't something I was very familiar with. I couldn't recite a single bible verse, didn't know the right way to cross myself, or even if these were the sort of church people that did that sort of thing. But I'd learned enough in my few years of college activism to recognize when a crowd was fired up, and to sense that special energy that's generated when a community gets together around a common purpose.That morning in church, I could feel my skin crawl with the static electricity in the air. Bill started his sermon by talking about the Book of Job and how it could serve as a parable of man's changing relationship with nature, and by extension, the divine. (You can read the whole sermon here). The sermon was funny, poetic, and revealing. But the thing that really stood out to me was the way faith could infuse activism with a whole new sense of energy.Standing up the pulpit, Bill implored the audience to join the fight against climate change, \"If you care about social justice. If you care about the injunctions that Jesus over and over again tells us to love our neighbor. If that matters to you, then this is the issue that matters most of all because we've never figured out any way to impoverish and wreck the lives of marginal people around the world more effectively than to destroy the basic physical stability on which those lives depend.\"Yes, this was Vermont and he was preaching to the choir (literally) but I'd rarely seen people respond in such a way to the topic of global warming. This choir suddenly didn't want to just sing a lament for the planet--they were ready to march out of the church and fight for it. Bill went on to speak about the particular role that faith communities could play in the fight for climate justice:One of our problems in our society and our economy is that we can't imagine anything other than more anymore. As President Clinton infamously said during his election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well communities of faith, churches and synagogues and mosques are the last institutions in our society that can really posit some reason other than accumulation for existence. That have some idea about why it isn't just more that's the place where we're headed. And that gives them potentially enormous power to do what the work of the church is, which is to be subversive - to be countercultural - to run contrary to the dominant currents of the world in which we live. And that's beginning to happen, you can sense its power in a lot of ways.   Now, nine years later, the sermon seems remarkably prescient. Since our walk across Vermont, I've worked nearly nonstop with Bill and a growing group of friends and colleagues around the world. Together, as 350.org, we've tried to help build a movement that can stand up to the dominant forces that are destroying our climate, namely the fossil fuel industry, and posit a different direction for our economy and society.That work took on special force when we got involved with the fossil fuel divestment movement back in 2012. At the time, a small handful of colleges like Swarthmore were running divestment campaigns. Since then, the effort has spread to thousands of universities, foundations, and churches around the world. Yesterday, we announced that more than 400 institutions representing $2.6 trillion in capital have made some form of divestment commitment: a 50 fold increase in commitments since just last year. Oxford University has called the effort the fastest growing divestment campaign in history.A lot of people ask me what I think accounts for the movement's success. I think the secret can be found back in that church in Vermont. The divestment campaign is rooted in a clear moral truth: if it's wrong to wreck the planet, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage. When we're making the case for divestment, we speak the language of financial returns, carbon bubbles, and economic impact, but the real power of the campaign, the argument that our targets can't avoid, is the moral one.That's probably why faith institutions have been such a powerful force in the divestment fight. Dozens of religious institutions have joined the campaign over the last three years, including the World Council of Churches, which represents half a billion Christians in 150 countries. This May, the Church of England announced it had sold £12m in thermal coal and tar sands. In June, Georgetown, one of the largest Catholic universities in the country, divested from coal (students are now pushing for full divestment). A month later, Islamic leaders endorsed divestment and called for a rapid phase out of fossil fuels in a declaration on climate change.And now there's the Pope. While this June's encyclical didn't include the word \"divestment,\" Pope Francis' message couldn't have been more clear: unless we can change the underpinnings of our economy, we won't be able to confront the climate crisis that threatens humanity.A few days after the encyclical dropped, the New York Times published an article, \"Papal Encyclical Heartens Proponents of Fossil-Fuel Divestment.\" The piece quotes our friend Bob Massie, wrote a book about the movement to divest from apartheid South Africa and has become a leading proponent of fossil fuel divestment. \"For activists who have been laboring for decades to elicit a courageous response from the world's governments and leading institutions, the pope's statement is a godsend,\" he told the paper. In a separate statement, Massie wrote, \"At a vital moment in world history, [Pope Francis] is calling on us to halt our wanton destruction of people and planet and move decisively to a global economy that is just, compassionate, and sustainable.\"This week, Pope Francis is visiting the United States. He's scheduled to make a number of major speeches, including one on the floor of Congress, where he's expected to make a strong case for climate action. I'm not sure if the Pope will say anything about divestment, but in a way, it's irrelevant: his moral call to action is so clear that there is no doubt in my mind he supports the effort. His presence alone will help electrify the divestment movement here in the US.Whether or not the Pope can get his own house in order and convince the notoriously shady Vatican Bank to divest is another story. More than 40,000 people have signed onto a petition urging the Vatican to take action. The call has been especially strong from Catholic leaders across the Global South, including from the Philippines, where faith communities have to respond to climate disaster after disaster over the past few years. While the Pope may be a champion for progressive change, he's up against an institution that practically defines the term \"intransigent.\"No matter what happens, it's clear that climate change is having a moral moment. The case for action has never been clearer, and with major mobilizations like last year's People's Climate March, there's hope that the movement for climate justice is finding its stride. Global warming is no longer a wonky, scientific issue that may affect some polar bears somewhere. It's one of the leading moral causes of our time.Bill closed his sermon that day in Vermont by reflecting on how our fossil fuel based economy doesn't just degrade the planet, but degrades the bonds we share with one another. \"The erosion of that community is a tragedy because it's that community that we were called to by God,\" he said. \"That is the hallmark of our species from the start, this need to be with each other in community. It's the greatest gift that we've been given and the one we've spurned in our culture most completely. We were built to cling to each other and remembering that is our salvation in every way.\"Looking back nearly a decade later, it feels like that community is coming back together. This sprawling, growing, tumultuous climate movement now spans all around the world. And while we may not be able to pack into a church or mosque or synagogue or community hall or bar together every weekend, we can still feel the bond that connects each and everyone of us. We can still feel that special electricity that comes when you're working together for change."}, {"title": "80-Year-Old Man's Train For Stray Dogs Is The Sweetest Ride Ever", "text": "Everyone deserves a little fun in life, even stray dogs.Eugene Bostick, an 80-year-old retiree, has a horse barn on a dead-end street in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Dodo.

He also wanted to take them on trips outside the farm.\"One day I was out and I seen this guy with a tractor who attached these carts to pull rocks. I thought, 'Dang, that would do for a dog train,'\" Bostick told the Dodo.

In a rare break with protocol President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden greeted him from the plane at Andrews Air Force Base. Today he will meet with the President at the White House and tomorrow he will be the first Pope to ever address the US Senate and House of Representatives in a Joint Session of Congress. The address will be watched by more than 40,000 people on TVs erected on the West Lawn of the Capitol and by millions throughout the world. The day after his address to Congress, Friday the 25th September, Pope Francis will formally address the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. His visit takes place during Climate Week, with less than three months to go before world leaders meet in Paris for the COP21 climate summit.At his election the Pope adopted the name of St. Francis of Assisi, who he described as \"the man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation;\" the world, as he says, \"with which we don't have such a good relationship.\" His visit to America is his most significant apostolic journey and could prove to be his greatest challenge.ENCYCLICAL On the 18th of June the Pope released his ground breaking Encyclical \"Laudato Si (Praise Be), On the Care of Our Common Home\", which called for action on climate change. The Encyclical provides desperately needed leadership. The Pope appealed to our unique place as human beings in the world, our relationship to our surroundings, and the need to put the common good before profit. The Pope spoke of the \"unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem\" and warned that failure to act would have \"grave consequences for all of us\". He urged world leaders to heed \"the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor\" and to take \"decisive action, here and now\" to save the planet from environmental ruin.In his Encyclical, the Pope also appealed, \"for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.\"Since the release of the Encyclical the Pope has been traveling the world delivering his environmental message. At a meeting of political, economic and civic leaders in Quito, Ecuador he said: \"As stewards of these riches which we have received, we have an obligation toward society as a whole, and toward future generations.\" He also called for the protection of the rainforest and its inhabitants.As well as warning of the imminent threat of catastrophic climate change Pope Francis has criticised consumerism and humanity's exploitation of natural resources. At a speech in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, during his visit to South America in July he said, \"Our common home is being pillaged, laid waste and harmed with impunity. Cowardice in defending it is a grave sin.\"Pope Francis meets with children in Bolivia Image Credit: Photographic Service L'Osservatore RomanoADDRESS TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES John Boehner, a representative from Ohio and Speaker of the House of Representatives, is a member of the Republican Party and the House's most senior Catholic. He has been inviting Popes to speak before Congress for more than twenty years. He sent invitations to John Paul II and Benedict XVI. They were declined. Tomorrow, Boehner's patience will finally pay off. It is ironic, however, that it is Pope Francis who accepted the invitation, a Pope \"so clearly at odds with the priorities of the Republican Party and with the priorities of the current House of Representatives\", according to James Weiss, Professor in Catholic Church History at Boston College. It is expected that the Pope will raise his environmental concerns before Congress tomorrow and address poverty and inequality. Time magazine report that in his address he will speak about \"bilateral relations and multinational relations as a sign of progress and coexistence.\" John Carr, Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University predicts an \"appeal to our hearts and souls\" on the issue of immigrants. Pope Francis may also mention divisive topics such as abortion and climate change. I hope he will address the issue of the death penalty.Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois is optimistic that the Pope's address will make climate change a less partisan issue, commenting, \"if he inspires us to consider policy, that will be a very successful effort.\" President Obama's advisor Charles Kupchan has said the Pope's \"essential messages will resonate very much with the President's agenda\".The Pope's climate change mission has divided opinion, along both religious and party lines. Representative Steve King, a Catholic Republican from Iowa said, \"There is no theology about global warming that exists in the Old or New Testament, so to be advocating along those lines I think dilutes the message from the spiritual perspective that we need to hear\". Republican Paul Gosar, who represents Arizona, is boycotting the address because the Pope will \"act and talk like a leftist politician\". To add fuel to the fire, Pope Francis arrives into the US following his visit to Cuba, where he met with Fidel Castro to discuss the common problems of humanity, including environmental degradation. Detractors have not forgotten the role he played in restoring diplomatic relations between the two states.UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADDRESS Pope Francis' environmental message may be more enthusiastically received in New York on Friday, when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly. Dozens of streets will be closed for his arrival and flyers have already been dropped in New York calling on people to \"rally with Pope Francis in the call to moral action for climate justice\".Ahead of the COP21 climate summit in Paris in December the need for a successful outcome is more urgent than ever. The Pope's address to the UN may prove a galvanising force. With his guidance and moral leadership there is hope that we may get a comprehensive and legally binding global climate change agreement needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, with provisions for the poorest and most vulnerable which would protect the rights of local communities and indigenous people.The Pope has criticised the lack of leadership on climate change and the \"failure of global summits\" to produce meaningful agreements. In his Encyclical he said, \"There are too many special interests, and economic interests [that] easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected.\" I fear Pope Francis is right.CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE UNFCCC What can we expect from COP21 in Paris? I have been attending the climate change conferences since COP13 in Bali in 2007. Each of them has failed to produce what is required to prevent catastrophic climate change. The International Energy Agency has already issued its bleak outlook for the climate summit in Paris, reporting, \"It is well known that the [greenhouse gas reductions pledges] will fall well short of what is needed to be on a path to the 2°C goal.\" There is, unfortunately, enough reason to be sceptical about this year's outcome.Miguel Cañete, the EU Commissioner for Climate Action, who will lead the EU's 28 member states at the COP21 negotiations has warned, \"There is no plan B if agreement is not reached in Paris. Nothing will follow. This is not just on-going UN discussions. Paris is final.\"Will world leaders realise that COP21 is the end of the line and seize this opportunity to address the threat of catastrophic climate change or will they continue to procrastinate?For decades, scientists have been warning us about the effects of climate change and its impact on the world. How tropical and subtropical regions in Africa, South Asia and Latin America will heat up more and more, with temperatures becoming increasingly intolerable. How rising sea levels will endanger between 147 and 216 million people, particularly those in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives as well as people in Tokyo, Shanghai, New York and London. How melting glaciers will flood river valleys and then, when they have disappeared, unprecedented droughts will occur, affecting large parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report finds that land and ocean surface temperatures have increased globally by nearly 1 degree Celsius since 1901. It is important to note that in parts of Africa, Asia, North America and South America surface temperatures have already risen by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius.Earlier this year, world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen, published a study outlining a scenario of rapid sea level rise combined with more intense storm systems. In the study Hansen and 16 other experts on ice sheets warn that the reality exceeds worse case scenarios and even limiting average global temperatures to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius is \"highly dangerous.\" They conclude: \"that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.\"The Antarctic's Ross Ice Shelf Image Credit: Michael Van Woert, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA.To avoid catastrophic climate change world leaders need to reach an agreement that keeps carbon dioxide levels below 350 parts per million (ppm). According to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California in San Diego the current CO2 levels of 398.82 ppm are the highest they have been in the last 800,000 years, with the average annual rate increasing by 2.11 ppm. A few months ago I spoke at the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto. To the west of the city are the vast mountain glaciers of the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Seventy per cent of those glaciers will disappear by 2100, if climate change is not slowed. Some 140,000 species of animal live in Canada, only half of which has been identified and never will be if their habitats are destroyed. On the opposite side of the world, the Antarctic ice cap is melting at its fastest rate since records began. A Princeton University study, published in May 2015 in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters journal found that more than 92 billion tons of Antarctic ice melted every year between 2003 and 2014 and that the rate of melting is accelerating. This is very alarming - if this ice were stacked on the island of Manhattan, that amount of ice would be a mile high, more than five times the height of the Empire State Building. One of the report's researchers, Christopher Harig said: \"[Melting Antarctic ice has the] potential to be a runaway problem. It has come to the point that if we continue losing mass in those areas, the loss can generate a self-reinforcing feedback whereby we will be losing more and more ice, ultimately raising sea levels by tens of feet.\" OUR COMMON FUTURE CONFERENCE, PARIS  Between the 6th and the 10th of July 2015, nearly 2,000 climate change experts gathered in Paris at the Our Common Future Under Climate Change conference. The aims of the conference were to: • Provide state-of-the-art scientific knowledge on climate change, one year after the release of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report • Explore ways to combine climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sustainable development • Assess the potential for evidence-based solutions to climate change challenges The delegates recognised the need to act with even greater urgency - because a two-year UN scientific review concluded that even limiting the rise of the earth's temperature to 2 degree Celsius from pre-industrial levels is inadequate and that the goal must be to limit the increase below 1.5 °C. According to this review, \"in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5 °C.\" The same study found that \"not only are we not on track to meet the long-term global goal, but the current emission rate is accelerating... emissions need to be cut significantly and immediately.\" The Conference's Outcome Statement found \"a two in three probability of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less will require a budget that limits future carbon dioxide emissions to about 900 billion tons, roughly 20 times annual emissions in 2014. To limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, emissions must be zero or even negative by the end of the 21st century... The window for economically feasible solutions with a reasonable prospect of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less is rapidly closing... Every nation has a role. Bold action in 2015 can be decisive in assuring a common future of sustainable, robust economies, equitable societies, and vibrant communities.\" In July 2015 a group of 24 British institutions (including the British Academy, the Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institution of Civil Engineers) issued a joint letter calling for immediate action to be taken by governments to avert the worst impacts of climate change. They said that tackling climate change now would drive economic progress, benefit the health of millions by cutting air pollution and improve access to energy, water and food.INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDCs) Under the current UN process, pledges by individual countries to cut emissions, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, will largely determine whether in the short term, and possibly in the longer term, we succeed, or fail in limiting global temperature rise beyond acceptable levels. As the World Resources Institute states, \"The INDCs will largely determine whether the world achieves an ambitious 2015 agreement and is put on a path toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.\"COP21 is less than 3 months away and 64 countries have submitted their INDCs. Key states, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey are yet to submit their pledges. Without these pledges it is difficult to assess whether the INDCs will be enough.After the climate negotiations in Bonn at the beginning of September (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action ADP 2.10) Climate Action Tracker published a joint statement from its four European research groups (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Climate Analytics, NewClimate Institute and Ecofys) reporting that current INDC emission cuts ahead of COP21 are insufficient and will lead to average warming of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels.Economist Lord Stern agrees that commitments already made by world governments to cut carbon emissions are not enough to keep global warming below the crucial 2 degree Celsius target - but, he thinks a strong deal is still possible in Paris.COP21 is our last chance. If negotiations fail the world will be a dramatically different place. We are at a critical crossroads and the world needs every country to be ambitious, bold, and uncompromising with its greenhouse gas emissions reduction pledges.THE HOPE FOR COP21 - A LEGALLY BINDING CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT  World leaders must do everything in their power to produce an agreement based on scientific facts, not on political expediency and vested interests. At COP21 they must deliver a comprehensive, just and legally binding climate agreement, with provision for the transfer of technology to developing countries, adequate adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and implementation mechanisms, with safeguards throughout for communities and indigenous peoples' rights.The current draft text of the agreement that is working its way towards Paris in December contains much to be commended but it is not enough. It is imperative that the Final Draft includes clauses on indigenous rights and land use. While these terms appear in the current draft, they must be given prominence near the top of the operative paragraphs in order that they can guide subsequent paragraphs relating to mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. This would ensure the rights of indigenous people throughout the world receive adequate protection.As the Pope said in his Encyclical it \"is essential to show special care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others, but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their land, they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless, in various parts of the world, pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture.\"I would like to add to the Pope's eloquent comments, that mega dams are also putting pressure on indigenous people. In the Amazon basin 412 dams are being built, with 242 of these in Brazil alone.President Obama at COP15 in Copenhagen, 2009 Image Credit: Official Whitehouse PhotoCONCLUSION It has been over 23 years since the UNFCCC treaty was established to \"stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". We have endured years of COP negotiations, promises, distant targets and shattered hope.On the road to Paris I am reminded of the expectations of COP15 in Copenhagen, 2009. Our hopes were high, and they were dashed. World leaders failed to deliver a comprehensive, legally binding, global climate change treaty. We can't let this happen again when world leaders meet in Paris in December. Paris is our last chance, the final opportunity to address the greatest threat of our time.At this critical juncture in history world leaders should reflect on Winston Churchill's address to Parliament on the eve of the Second World War: \"The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\"I hope that world leaders attending COP21 will listen to Pope Francis, act with courage and conviction and emerge from the conference with an agreement that, in the words of the Pope, \"protects our common home\" and \"brings the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development\", to preserve \"resources for present and future generations\"."}, {"title": "Here's How To Beat The Heat -- Fight Forest Fires With Fire", "text": "Thanks to the brutal fires raging in states like Washington and California, 2015 will go down as one of the most destructive years from wildfires.Compared with the last 10 years, when there were more than 57,000 fires on average by this point in the year, there have been only 47,000 fires in 2015, according to the Forest Service. But this year's fires have devoured 8.9 million acres, compared with 6.1 million acres on average. This year stands out even more, because 2014 and 2013 were relatively quiet, with below-average numbers of fires and acres burned.“So far, by some measures, it’s been one of the worst fire seasons we’ve had,” said Tom Harbour, Forest Service director of fire and aviation management. Harbour, a 45-year veteran of the Forest Service, added: “Fire season is never over anymore. It’s year-round.”There seems to be smoke everywhere in the West. More acres have burned in Washington state than ever, thanks to enormous fires like the North Star fire, which blackened 218,000 acres through Tuesday. Alaska is emerging from a record-setting season that saw 5.1 million acres go up in smoke. The Valley and Butte fires in northern California destroyed more than 1,000 homes.Climactic factors are largely to blame, scientists say. Trees, shrubs and other fuel are ready to burst into flames because of higher temperatures and prolonged periods of drought. California’s been hit with pervasive drought for four years. Who knows which region will next have to pray for rain?“There’s a future where it looks like we’re going to have an increasing number of large fires that pose a threat to our communities,” said Harbour.Extinguishing every fire is a strategy that carries enormous costs. This summer, the Forest Service spent $200 million a week battling fires, Oregon TV station KGW reported.The Forest Service has reshaped itself as fires have become more severe and more frequent. In 1985, 16 percent of its budget went to fighting fires. This year, fires ate up 52 percent of the budget. Fire personal made up about 25 percent of Forest Service employees in 1990. Today, they are more than half the workforce.“They do a great job in fire suppressions. They’re trying to keep people as safe as possible, which is quite remarkable,” said University of California, Berkeley, professor Scott Stephens. He co-authored an article entitled “Reform forest fire management” in Science magazine last week that warned of what would happen if officials didn’t balance fire suppression with controlled burns and thinning dense areas of growth.”We’re going to be chasing forest fires in cycles forever,” Stephens said, unless forest fire managers integrate controlled burns and systematic thinning of forests into their repertoire.To a certain extent, those policies are on the books. They’re just overlooked in favor of suppression, experts said.It’s not all bad news. Scientists point to strategies that should be emulated across the board. As dire as this year has been, some officials had the foresight to plan for a hot and dry 2015.Cal Fire, California’s forest fire department, staffed up with additional firefighters earlier than usual this year, thanks to emergency drought measures enacted by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) last year. The department also brought in extra helicopters and other firefighting equipment.“It’s allowed us to be able to meet the increase in fires,” said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant. “Without a doubt it’s been an extremely busy year.”Some cities and towns set among tinderbox conditions have taken matters into their own hands as they seek long-term precautions, said the Nature Conservancy’s Christopher Topik.Several fires over Labor Day 2011 devastated Austin, Texas. To avoid a repeat, the city and surrounding area are trying clear wood that would fuel fires and to eliminate other hazards.Ashland, Oregon, sits on the edge of a vast forest where fires are frequent. Officials there inform residents of the risks by making door-to-door visits to distribute material and answer questions.Prescribed burns, or intentionally set fires, are an underused tool for rejuvenating forests, according to fire experts. Many officials worry about losing control of a blaze, though fire managers in the South apparently aren’t as jittery about letting go of a fire. The Ozark National Forest in Arkansas boasts diverse flora, according to Topik, because of success there with controlled burns.“They never lost the culture of burning,” said Topik, Nature Conservancy’s director of restoring America’s forests. “It’s like a reference on what we want.”There’s a real risk of, course, that something could go wrong when you’re literally playing with fire.An infamous example was the 2000 Cerro Grande fire, a controlled burn that ran amok in New Mexico and damaged hundreds of homes. It heightened fears as it burned faculties at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which houses nuclear material. Luckily, no radiation leaked.There are actually too many trees these days, according to scientists. Parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains, which are plagued by fires, have 400 big trees per acre, according to Stephens, of UC, Berkeley. A hundred years ago, there were to 50 to 60. Fires spread slower and over less territory in conditions like that. Thinning dense growth ought to be a priority, Stephens and others researchers said.The Science article writers didn’t acknowledge that these suggestions already formed Forest Service policy, Harbour said. Over the last 10 years, the Forest Service has treated 25 million acres via prescribed burns and restorations to make them more fire-resistant. That’s out of approximately 200 million acres under Forest Service protection -- a drop in the bucket, according to critics.“There are restoration programs going on, but the scale of it is quite limited relative to the need,” said Jerry Franklin, a University of Washington professor and co-author of the Science article.An unusual controversy broke out after the publication of the article, and the Forest Service distanced itself from the paper, even though it was co-written by Malcolm North, one of their own ecologists.The Forest Service disapproved of North making policy recommendations. Science added a disclaimer saying the article didn’t reflect official Forest Service positions. The Forest Service didn’t make North available for an interview with The Huffington Post.This used to be the time of year where federal, state and local firefighters could count on cooler temperatures to help bring raging fires back under control. In a few weeks, higher elevations may even start seeing snow. But the burning season extends deeper into the fall each year.“We need to prevent the new normal from being even worse,” said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California. “We’re dealing with a very different situation.”"}, {"title": "PETA Won't Answer Some Very Basic Questions About Why It Kills So Many Shelter Animals", "text": "Last year, the nonprofit group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals euthanized more than 2,000 dogs and cats at its sole U.S. shelter -- and it's not at all clear how it made the decision to do so.The group has put down so many animals at its facility in Norfolk, Virginia, that in 2014 the state passed a law, SB 1381, that pointedly defined a private animal shelter as \"a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.\"PETA lobbied against that bill, and in a July email released to the public last week, a senior executive at the animal rights group argued to a Virginia lawmaker that there was no need for the legislation to exist at all.\"We have always found permanent adoptive homes for our adoptable animals, and will continue to do so,\" wrote Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of PETA, in a July 24 email to Virginia state Sen. Frank Wagner (R). \"No one disagrees that animal shelters -- private and public -- should have as a purpose finding permanent adoptive homes for adoptable animals. There is no need for a guidance document or additional regulations on this.\" (Emphasis in the original.)That PETA should have balked at increased regulatory attention comes as little surprise, given the group's preference for opacity over transparency in certain matters -- particularly the question of how it decides which animals to euthanize, and why it puts so many animals to death each year.Self-reported statistics filed with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services show that PETA's Norfolk shelter took in 1,606 cats in 2014, of which 1,536 were euthanized. Dogs fared a little better -- of the 1,025 taken in, 788 were euthanized.PETA doesn't dispute the figures. In fact, the group trumpeted them in a press release listing its 2014 accomplishments.But PETA has not been so forthcoming about what policies or processes it uses, if any, when making the decision to euthanize. Since the group's 2014 statistics were first reported in January, The Huffington Post has asked PETA multiple times for more information about how it actually determines which animals in its care will live and which will die. In each case, PETA has either declined to comment, failed to address the details of HuffPost's questions or failed to respond at all.PETA says its euthanasia figures reflect hundreds of humane killings, intended to end the suffering of animals who are -- in the words of a January press release -- \"elderly, feral, sick, dying, aggressive, and otherwise unadoptable.\" The group describes itself as a resource for animal owners of limited means.\"More than 500 [of these animals] were brought to PETA by destitute guardians desperate to alleviate their animals' suffering and others who had been turned away by 'no-kill' facilities that reject unadoptable animals in order to keep 'save rates' high,\" the release reads.The group's methods, however, are far from clear. There are few details available about how PETA workers reach the conclusion that a given animal is so aggressive, dying, feral or diseased that it can never be adopted. HuffPost has asked PETA whether it gives each animal a medical and behavioral exam, as is standard practice in many other shelters -- and how such exams, if they take place, inform PETA's decisions about euthanasia. The group has not provided that information.HuffPost posed these questions to PETA again last week, after the publication of Nachminovitch's letter. In response, Colleen O'Brien, the group's senior director of communications, replied as follows:Thank you for your e-mail. PETA has always served those in our community who have limited resources -- including those who can't afford veterinary care, even for euthanasia when their dogs and cats are suffering during old age or from sickness or injuries. We're there to take in the aggressive or feral animals rejected by other shelters for being unadoptable. We do so without appointments, waiting lists, fees, or restricted hours. And we save hundreds of lives every single day by preventing future homelessness with our fleet of clinics that spay and neuter more than 10,000 animals a year at no or low cost -- and close to 120,000 dogs and cats have been \"fixed\" so far in this area alone.\"The organization can certainly be its own worst enemy,\" reads the op-ed O'Brien cites, an unsigned editorial by the board of The Virginian-Pilot, a Norfolk newspaper. \"But PETA does a job no one else wants. Some of the region's other shelters have transitioned to 'no kill'; they euthanize no more than 10 percent of their animals and charge fees to those who drop one off. PETA fills a role that has been abandoned by other organizations ... The premise that PETA should simply be like other animal shelters and find homes for all the critters it takes in, regardless of their physical states, is unrealistic -- and unwise from a public policy perspective. As long as people abandon or surrender their pets, as long as other shelters choose to turn away injured, aggressive or feral animals, there'll be a need for PETA to do what it does.\"O'Brien did not respond to a request for further comment.'We never turn an animal away'PETA's many critics have described the group's kill rates as \"shocking\" and unnecessary.Robin Robertson Starr, chief executive officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Richmond, Virginia, told HuffPost in March that it was \"very troubling\" for PETA to continually repeat the claim that \"old, sick and injured animals\" couldn't find adoptive homes.\"Older animals are still very adoptable and age should not be seen as an impediment to adoption efforts,\" Starr said. \"It certainly is not at the Richmond SPCA, where we take in many senior pets and adopt them to lasting and loving homes.\"The Virginia legislature and governor seemed to share that view, passing and signing SB 1381 this spring over PETA's objections. A few months later, Nachminovitch wrote her email to the state senator, in which she cited PETA's record of taking in \"aggressive, dying, feral, diseased, and otherwise unadoptable animals.\"\"We never turn an animal away,\" Nachminovitch wrote. \"Of course our disposition outcome statistics are different from those of a private animal shelter that rejects animals precisely because they are unadoptable or difficult to place.\"The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has the authority to interpret and implement SB 1381. The law's sponsors predict that the legislation will force PETA to reduce its killing and increase its efforts to find homes for its animals.\"To an organization like PETA, whose average kill rate of companion animals taken into its 'shelter' exceeds 90 percent, this bill posed a threat,\" wrote the bill's sponsor, Virginia state Sen. Bill Stanley (R), in an opinion column in March. \"PETA does not operate a private animal shelter 'for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals.'\"The law was supposed to go into effect on July 1, but VDACS is still drafting \"guidance documents.\" In an email last week, spokeswoman Elaine Lidholm told HuffPost to \"check back\" in three months on the status of the law.Meanwhile, in TexasWhile PETA is tight-lipped about its euthanasia practices, many other shelters readily share this information.\"Shelters are entrusted to care for the lost, stray, abandoned and abused animals,\" Steffen Baldwin, executive director for Top of Ohio Pet Shelter, a private shelter in rural Ohio, told HuffPost in an email. \"Any shelter that hides how that care is provided, including end of life decisions, is doing a disservice not only to the animals in their care, but to the sources of the funds to provide said care, as well as the public at large -- who trust our facilities and our staff to do right by each animal that comes through our doors.\"Many shelters simply post their behavioral and medical evaluation procedures online. Some also spoke with HuffPost directly.The Washington Humane Society is D.C.'s municipal shelter. Like PETA, WHS has an open-admission policy, meaning that it will take in any animal. As with PETA, this means WHS accepts many animals that have been rejected by smaller or limited-admission shelters -- \"animals that other groups won't or can't\" take in, as Stephanie Shain, the group's chief operating officer, put it.In 2014, WHS had a \"live release rate\" of 86.53 percent, meaning that more than 4 in every 5 animals left the shelter alive -- generally because they were adopted or reunited with their owners, or because an animal rescue group found a foster home for the animal and assumed care of it.Shain said that at WHS, before any decisions are made about euthanasia, animals receive a physical and behavioral evaluation. Animals with medical and behavioral issues \"routinely\" receive treatment, she said, including some with hard-to-treat conditions.Some animals found to have terminal or untreatable illnesses may get to live in an end-of-life foster home, where they will receive hospice care.\"These are for animals who aren't suffering but who have a condition that can't be treated,\" Shain said. \"Those animals won't likely be adopted, but we want the end of their life to be in a home and well cared for.\"But not every animal is saved.\"We do euthanize animals who have behavior problems we do not feel can be safely addressed or who have medical conditions that are beyond our ability to remedy,\" Shain said.Baldwin's organization, Top of Ohio Pet Shelter, was similarly forthcoming when asked about its policies and procedures.Baldwin said that his shelter takes in every stray dog, but not every cat, and not every dog given up by an owner. Last year, TOPS had a live release rate of over 90 percent.The animals that didn't make it were thoroughly evaluated before euthanasia was even considered as an option, Baldwin told HuffPost. Each of these animals received a medical exam performed by a veterinarian, as well as a formal behavioral evaluation akin to the ones developed by the ASPCA, supplemented with observations from shelter staff and volunteers.If it is determined that \"the animal is suffering beyond the point where medical care can end that suffering, or when the animal’s behavior is unsafe for us to place into the public and rehabilitation efforts with a reputable rescue have been exhausted,\" the animal will be put down, Baldwin said.The Austin Animal Center -- an open-admission city shelter in Austin, Texas, that takes in some 18,000 animals each year -- describes a similarly process. The shelter is known for maintaining a live release rate of at least 90 percent (though the office of the city auditor found earlier this year that AAC will need more resources to maintain that rate without overcrowding at the shelter).Kristen Auerbach, deputy chief animal services officer at AAC, said that \"animals receive initial and ongoing medical and behavioral assessments. We save the vast majority of animals that come into our shelter ... The only animals that are euthanized are ill and suffering with a poor prognosis or are unsafe to adopt.\"Both AAC and WHS will euthanize an animal if the owner comes in and asks for it. But neither facility will do this without first conducting an exam.\"When we have a pet surrendered for euthanasia, it is always examined by our vets prior to being euthanized to make sure the animal is suffering and truly needs to be euthanized,\" Auerbach said. \"We do not euthanize animals just because an owner requests they be euthanized.\"The roomIn March, a reporter from Religion News Services visited the PETA shelter in Norfolk, as Virginia was considering SB 1381 and as PETA was on a campaign to stop the legislation.The reporter, Lauren Markoe, saw the shelter's euthanasia room and seemed impressed with it, ending her story with these observations:The euthanasia clinic is on the ground floor. There is one small room, softly lit by a standing lamp. A poster is mounted above the padded surgical table where the animals receive their lethal injections. It shows three dogs that PETA staff have cared for, and reads:But if PETA's euthanasia room itself is dark and quiet, the path that leads to that room could use a bit more light.\"If PETA is truly operating a private shelter, as they claim and as defined under Virginia law, then they owe the public an explanation of the medical standards and veterinary analysis they apply before euthanizing a supposedly sick or injured animal,\" said Starr, the CEO of the Richmond SPCA. \"If they are in fact a euthanasia facility rather than a shelter, then they should acknowledge that honestly and not seek to come under the private shelter regulations.\"Last year, incidentally, VDACS data shows that the Richmond SPCA took in 2,189 cats and 1,670 dogs. Starr says many came in with bad illnesses or injuries. Each animal was given thorough medical evaluations, and, where needed, veterinary care.Seven of the dogs and one of the cats were euthanized.Hilary Hanson contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Toddler Tries To Take 80-Pound Dog For A Walk, Failure Ensues", "text": "Dogs and kids make excellent cuddle buddies, but when it comes to getting up and walking around, they may not be so well matched.This adorable video shows an 11-month-old boy attempting to take his English bulldog Bernie for a walk.

As we made our way along the back roads of the Champlain Valley over the next few days, our numbers began to swell. By the time we reached Burlington, over a thousand people had joined the march -- a practical revolution in our small state, and enough to convince every candidate running for federal office to sign onto our demand to cut carbon \"80% by 2050.\"I have many fond memories from the march, but one of the most meaningful is of a sermon that Bill gave at a church in Charlotte, Vermont on the second to last day of our journey. As an agnostic kid from Cambridge, Massachusetts, churches weren't something I was very familiar with. I couldn't recite a single bible verse, didn't know the right way to cross myself, or even if these were the sort of church people that did that sort of thing. But I'd learned enough in my few years of college activism to recognize when a crowd was fired up, and to sense that special energy that's generated when a community gets together around a common purpose.That morning in church, I could feel my skin crawl with the static electricity in the air. Bill started his sermon by talking about the Book of Job and how it could serve as a parable of man's changing relationship with nature, and by extension, the divine. (You can read the whole sermon here). The sermon was funny, poetic, and revealing. But the thing that really stood out to me was the way faith could infuse activism with a whole new sense of energy.Standing up the pulpit, Bill implored the audience to join the fight against climate change, \"If you care about social justice. If you care about the injunctions that Jesus over and over again tells us to love our neighbor. If that matters to you, then this is the issue that matters most of all because we've never figured out any way to impoverish and wreck the lives of marginal people around the world more effectively than to destroy the basic physical stability on which those lives depend.\"Yes, this was Vermont and he was preaching to the choir (literally) but I'd rarely seen people respond in such a way to the topic of global warming. This choir suddenly didn't want to just sing a lament for the planet--they were ready to march out of the church and fight for it. Bill went on to speak about the particular role that faith communities could play in the fight for climate justice:One of our problems in our society and our economy is that we can't imagine anything other than more anymore. As President Clinton infamously said during his election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well communities of faith, churches and synagogues and mosques are the last institutions in our society that can really posit some reason other than accumulation for existence. That have some idea about why it isn't just more that's the place where we're headed. And that gives them potentially enormous power to do what the work of the church is, which is to be subversive - to be countercultural - to run contrary to the dominant currents of the world in which we live. And that's beginning to happen, you can sense its power in a lot of ways.   Now, nine years later, the sermon seems remarkably prescient. Since our walk across Vermont, I've worked nearly nonstop with Bill and a growing group of friends and colleagues around the world. Together, as 350.org, we've tried to help build a movement that can stand up to the dominant forces that are destroying our climate, namely the fossil fuel industry, and posit a different direction for our economy and society.That work took on special force when we got involved with the fossil fuel divestment movement back in 2012. At the time, a small handful of colleges like Swarthmore were running divestment campaigns. Since then, the effort has spread to thousands of universities, foundations, and churches around the world. Yesterday, we announced that more than 400 institutions representing $2.6 trillion in capital have made some form of divestment commitment: a 50 fold increase in commitments since just last year. Oxford University has called the effort the fastest growing divestment campaign in history.A lot of people ask me what I think accounts for the movement's success. I think the secret can be found back in that church in Vermont. The divestment campaign is rooted in a clear moral truth: if it's wrong to wreck the planet, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage. When we're making the case for divestment, we speak the language of financial returns, carbon bubbles, and economic impact, but the real power of the campaign, the argument that our targets can't avoid, is the moral one.That's probably why faith institutions have been such a powerful force in the divestment fight. Dozens of religious institutions have joined the campaign over the last three years, including the World Council of Churches, which represents half a billion Christians in 150 countries. This May, the Church of England announced it had sold £12m in thermal coal and tar sands. In June, Georgetown, one of the largest Catholic universities in the country, divested from coal (students are now pushing for full divestment). A month later, Islamic leaders endorsed divestment and called for a rapid phase out of fossil fuels in a declaration on climate change.And now there's the Pope. While this June's encyclical didn't include the word \"divestment,\" Pope Francis' message couldn't have been more clear: unless we can change the underpinnings of our economy, we won't be able to confront the climate crisis that threatens humanity.A few days after the encyclical dropped, the New York Times published an article, \"Papal Encyclical Heartens Proponents of Fossil-Fuel Divestment.\" The piece quotes our friend Bob Massie, wrote a book about the movement to divest from apartheid South Africa and has become a leading proponent of fossil fuel divestment. \"For activists who have been laboring for decades to elicit a courageous response from the world's governments and leading institutions, the pope's statement is a godsend,\" he told the paper. In a separate statement, Massie wrote, \"At a vital moment in world history, [Pope Francis] is calling on us to halt our wanton destruction of people and planet and move decisively to a global economy that is just, compassionate, and sustainable.\"This week, Pope Francis is visiting the United States. He's scheduled to make a number of major speeches, including one on the floor of Congress, where he's expected to make a strong case for climate action. I'm not sure if the Pope will say anything about divestment, but in a way, it's irrelevant: his moral call to action is so clear that there is no doubt in my mind he supports the effort. His presence alone will help electrify the divestment movement here in the US.Whether or not the Pope can get his own house in order and convince the notoriously shady Vatican Bank to divest is another story. More than 40,000 people have signed onto a petition urging the Vatican to take action. The call has been especially strong from Catholic leaders across the Global South, including from the Philippines, where faith communities have to respond to climate disaster after disaster over the past few years. While the Pope may be a champion for progressive change, he's up against an institution that practically defines the term \"intransigent.\"No matter what happens, it's clear that climate change is having a moral moment. The case for action has never been clearer, and with major mobilizations like last year's People's Climate March, there's hope that the movement for climate justice is finding its stride. Global warming is no longer a wonky, scientific issue that may affect some polar bears somewhere. It's one of the leading moral causes of our time.Bill closed his sermon that day in Vermont by reflecting on how our fossil fuel based economy doesn't just degrade the planet, but degrades the bonds we share with one another. \"The erosion of that community is a tragedy because it's that community that we were called to by God,\" he said. \"That is the hallmark of our species from the start, this need to be with each other in community. It's the greatest gift that we've been given and the one we've spurned in our culture most completely. We were built to cling to each other and remembering that is our salvation in every way.\"Looking back nearly a decade later, it feels like that community is coming back together. This sprawling, growing, tumultuous climate movement now spans all around the world. And while we may not be able to pack into a church or mosque or synagogue or community hall or bar together every weekend, we can still feel the bond that connects each and everyone of us. We can still feel that special electricity that comes when you're working together for change."}, {"title": "80-Year-Old Man's Train For Stray Dogs Is The Sweetest Ride Ever", "text": "Everyone deserves a little fun in life, even stray dogs.Eugene Bostick, an 80-year-old retiree, has a horse barn on a dead-end street in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Dodo. He noticed that people would go to the area to abandon their dogs. Bostick and his brother decided to take them in, giving them shelter and food. He also wanted to take them on trips outside the farm.\"One day I was out and I seen this guy with a tractor who attached these carts to pull rocks. I thought, 'Dang, that would do for a dog train,'\" Bostick told the Dodo. He uses the makeshift train to take the dogs through the streets, to a nearby forest or creek. \"Whenever they hear me hooking the tractor up to it, man, they get so excited. They all come running and jump in on their own. They're ready to go.\"Photos of Bostick and his buddies recently surfaced on social media.A video of him and his dogs was posted on YouTube back in 2013. In the 20-second clip, he can be seen driving the tractor while the pups bark from their seats behind.Last year, they even made it onto the local news after taking a ride through the Sycamore Creek Golf Course. Corky, Eugene's brother, told NBC's Dallas/Fort-Worth station the rides, which last an hour and a half, are not only great for the dogs, but also for their family.\"Well I’ve been feeding the wildlife for over 30 years here, and I’m going to live another 30,\" he said. \"I’m only 86! My wife said if I didn’t get up and do this I’d be dead. And I really would.\""}, {"title": "Pope Francis' Historic Visit to the U.S. and the Chance to Spur Action on Climate Change", "text": "In his most significant apostolic journey Pope Francis will be calling for action on climate changePope Francis greeting the crowds Image Credit: Photographic Service L'Osservatore RomanoINTRODUCTION Yesterday, Pope Francis landed in Washington to begin a historic US visit. In a rare break with protocol President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden greeted him from the plane at Andrews Air Force Base. Today he will meet with the President at the White House and tomorrow he will be the first Pope to ever address the US Senate and House of Representatives in a Joint Session of Congress. The address will be watched by more than 40,000 people on TVs erected on the West Lawn of the Capitol and by millions throughout the world. The day after his address to Congress, Friday the 25th September, Pope Francis will formally address the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. His visit takes place during Climate Week, with less than three months to go before world leaders meet in Paris for the COP21 climate summit.At his election the Pope adopted the name of St. Francis of Assisi, who he described as \"the man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation;\" the world, as he says, \"with which we don't have such a good relationship.\" His visit to America is his most significant apostolic journey and could prove to be his greatest challenge.ENCYCLICAL On the 18th of June the Pope released his ground breaking Encyclical \"Laudato Si (Praise Be), On the Care of Our Common Home\", which called for action on climate change. The Encyclical provides desperately needed leadership. The Pope appealed to our unique place as human beings in the world, our relationship to our surroundings, and the need to put the common good before profit. The Pope spoke of the \"unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem\" and warned that failure to act would have \"grave consequences for all of us\". He urged world leaders to heed \"the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor\" and to take \"decisive action, here and now\" to save the planet from environmental ruin.In his Encyclical, the Pope also appealed, \"for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.\"Since the release of the Encyclical the Pope has been traveling the world delivering his environmental message. At a meeting of political, economic and civic leaders in Quito, Ecuador he said: \"As stewards of these riches which we have received, we have an obligation toward society as a whole, and toward future generations.\" He also called for the protection of the rainforest and its inhabitants.As well as warning of the imminent threat of catastrophic climate change Pope Francis has criticised consumerism and humanity's exploitation of natural resources. At a speech in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, during his visit to South America in July he said, \"Our common home is being pillaged, laid waste and harmed with impunity. Cowardice in defending it is a grave sin.\"Pope Francis meets with children in Bolivia Image Credit: Photographic Service L'Osservatore RomanoADDRESS TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES John Boehner, a representative from Ohio and Speaker of the House of Representatives, is a member of the Republican Party and the House's most senior Catholic. He has been inviting Popes to speak before Congress for more than twenty years. He sent invitations to John Paul II and Benedict XVI. They were declined. Tomorrow, Boehner's patience will finally pay off. It is ironic, however, that it is Pope Francis who accepted the invitation, a Pope \"so clearly at odds with the priorities of the Republican Party and with the priorities of the current House of Representatives\", according to James Weiss, Professor in Catholic Church History at Boston College. It is expected that the Pope will raise his environmental concerns before Congress tomorrow and address poverty and inequality. Time magazine report that in his address he will speak about \"bilateral relations and multinational relations as a sign of progress and coexistence.\" John Carr, Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University predicts an \"appeal to our hearts and souls\" on the issue of immigrants. Pope Francis may also mention divisive topics such as abortion and climate change. I hope he will address the issue of the death penalty.Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois is optimistic that the Pope's address will make climate change a less partisan issue, commenting, \"if he inspires us to consider policy, that will be a very successful effort.\" President Obama's advisor Charles Kupchan has said the Pope's \"essential messages will resonate very much with the President's agenda\".The Pope's climate change mission has divided opinion, along both religious and party lines. Representative Steve King, a Catholic Republican from Iowa said, \"There is no theology about global warming that exists in the Old or New Testament, so to be advocating along those lines I think dilutes the message from the spiritual perspective that we need to hear\". Republican Paul Gosar, who represents Arizona, is boycotting the address because the Pope will \"act and talk like a leftist politician\". To add fuel to the fire, Pope Francis arrives into the US following his visit to Cuba, where he met with Fidel Castro to discuss the common problems of humanity, including environmental degradation. Detractors have not forgotten the role he played in restoring diplomatic relations between the two states.UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADDRESS Pope Francis' environmental message may be more enthusiastically received in New York on Friday, when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly. Dozens of streets will be closed for his arrival and flyers have already been dropped in New York calling on people to \"rally with Pope Francis in the call to moral action for climate justice\".Ahead of the COP21 climate summit in Paris in December the need for a successful outcome is more urgent than ever. The Pope's address to the UN may prove a galvanising force. With his guidance and moral leadership there is hope that we may get a comprehensive and legally binding global climate change agreement needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, with provisions for the poorest and most vulnerable which would protect the rights of local communities and indigenous people.The Pope has criticised the lack of leadership on climate change and the \"failure of global summits\" to produce meaningful agreements. In his Encyclical he said, \"There are too many special interests, and economic interests [that] easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected.\" I fear Pope Francis is right.CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE UNFCCC What can we expect from COP21 in Paris? I have been attending the climate change conferences since COP13 in Bali in 2007. Each of them has failed to produce what is required to prevent catastrophic climate change. The International Energy Agency has already issued its bleak outlook for the climate summit in Paris, reporting, \"It is well known that the [greenhouse gas reductions pledges] will fall well short of what is needed to be on a path to the 2°C goal.\" There is, unfortunately, enough reason to be sceptical about this year's outcome.Miguel Cañete, the EU Commissioner for Climate Action, who will lead the EU's 28 member states at the COP21 negotiations has warned, \"There is no plan B if agreement is not reached in Paris. Nothing will follow. This is not just on-going UN discussions. Paris is final.\"Will world leaders realise that COP21 is the end of the line and seize this opportunity to address the threat of catastrophic climate change or will they continue to procrastinate?For decades, scientists have been warning us about the effects of climate change and its impact on the world. How tropical and subtropical regions in Africa, South Asia and Latin America will heat up more and more, with temperatures becoming increasingly intolerable. How rising sea levels will endanger between 147 and 216 million people, particularly those in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives as well as people in Tokyo, Shanghai, New York and London. How melting glaciers will flood river valleys and then, when they have disappeared, unprecedented droughts will occur, affecting large parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report finds that land and ocean surface temperatures have increased globally by nearly 1 degree Celsius since 1901. It is important to note that in parts of Africa, Asia, North America and South America surface temperatures have already risen by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius.Earlier this year, world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen, published a study outlining a scenario of rapid sea level rise combined with more intense storm systems. In the study Hansen and 16 other experts on ice sheets warn that the reality exceeds worse case scenarios and even limiting average global temperatures to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius is \"highly dangerous.\" They conclude: \"that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.\"The Antarctic's Ross Ice Shelf Image Credit: Michael Van Woert, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA.To avoid catastrophic climate change world leaders need to reach an agreement that keeps carbon dioxide levels below 350 parts per million (ppm). According to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California in San Diego the current CO2 levels of 398.82 ppm are the highest they have been in the last 800,000 years, with the average annual rate increasing by 2.11 ppm. A few months ago I spoke at the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto. To the west of the city are the vast mountain glaciers of the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Seventy per cent of those glaciers will disappear by 2100, if climate change is not slowed. Some 140,000 species of animal live in Canada, only half of which has been identified and never will be if their habitats are destroyed. On the opposite side of the world, the Antarctic ice cap is melting at its fastest rate since records began. A Princeton University study, published in May 2015 in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters journal found that more than 92 billion tons of Antarctic ice melted every year between 2003 and 2014 and that the rate of melting is accelerating. This is very alarming - if this ice were stacked on the island of Manhattan, that amount of ice would be a mile high, more than five times the height of the Empire State Building. One of the report's researchers, Christopher Harig said: \"[Melting Antarctic ice has the] potential to be a runaway problem. It has come to the point that if we continue losing mass in those areas, the loss can generate a self-reinforcing feedback whereby we will be losing more and more ice, ultimately raising sea levels by tens of feet.\" OUR COMMON FUTURE CONFERENCE, PARIS  Between the 6th and the 10th of July 2015, nearly 2,000 climate change experts gathered in Paris at the Our Common Future Under Climate Change conference. The aims of the conference were to: • Provide state-of-the-art scientific knowledge on climate change, one year after the release of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report • Explore ways to combine climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sustainable development • Assess the potential for evidence-based solutions to climate change challenges The delegates recognised the need to act with even greater urgency - because a two-year UN scientific review concluded that even limiting the rise of the earth's temperature to 2 degree Celsius from pre-industrial levels is inadequate and that the goal must be to limit the increase below 1.5 °C. According to this review, \"in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5 °C.\" The same study found that \"not only are we not on track to meet the long-term global goal, but the current emission rate is accelerating... emissions need to be cut significantly and immediately.\" The Conference's Outcome Statement found \"a two in three probability of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less will require a budget that limits future carbon dioxide emissions to about 900 billion tons, roughly 20 times annual emissions in 2014. To limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, emissions must be zero or even negative by the end of the 21st century... The window for economically feasible solutions with a reasonable prospect of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less is rapidly closing... Every nation has a role. Bold action in 2015 can be decisive in assuring a common future of sustainable, robust economies, equitable societies, and vibrant communities.\" In July 2015 a group of 24 British institutions (including the British Academy, the Royal Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institution of Civil Engineers) issued a joint letter calling for immediate action to be taken by governments to avert the worst impacts of climate change. They said that tackling climate change now would drive economic progress, benefit the health of millions by cutting air pollution and improve access to energy, water and food.INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDCs) Under the current UN process, pledges by individual countries to cut emissions, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, will largely determine whether in the short term, and possibly in the longer term, we succeed, or fail in limiting global temperature rise beyond acceptable levels. As the World Resources Institute states, \"The INDCs will largely determine whether the world achieves an ambitious 2015 agreement and is put on a path toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.\"COP21 is less than 3 months away and 64 countries have submitted their INDCs. Key states, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey are yet to submit their pledges. Without these pledges it is difficult to assess whether the INDCs will be enough.After the climate negotiations in Bonn at the beginning of September (Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action ADP 2.10) Climate Action Tracker published a joint statement from its four European research groups (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Climate Analytics, NewClimate Institute and Ecofys) reporting that current INDC emission cuts ahead of COP21 are insufficient and will lead to average warming of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels.Economist Lord Stern agrees that commitments already made by world governments to cut carbon emissions are not enough to keep global warming below the crucial 2 degree Celsius target - but, he thinks a strong deal is still possible in Paris.COP21 is our last chance. If negotiations fail the world will be a dramatically different place. We are at a critical crossroads and the world needs every country to be ambitious, bold, and uncompromising with its greenhouse gas emissions reduction pledges.THE HOPE FOR COP21 - A LEGALLY BINDING CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT  World leaders must do everything in their power to produce an agreement based on scientific facts, not on political expediency and vested interests. At COP21 they must deliver a comprehensive, just and legally binding climate agreement, with provision for the transfer of technology to developing countries, adequate adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and implementation mechanisms, with safeguards throughout for communities and indigenous peoples' rights.The current draft text of the agreement that is working its way towards Paris in December contains much to be commended but it is not enough. It is imperative that the Final Draft includes clauses on indigenous rights and land use. While these terms appear in the current draft, they must be given prominence near the top of the operative paragraphs in order that they can guide subsequent paragraphs relating to mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. This would ensure the rights of indigenous people throughout the world receive adequate protection.As the Pope said in his Encyclical it \"is essential to show special care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others, but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their land, they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless, in various parts of the world, pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture.\"I would like to add to the Pope's eloquent comments, that mega dams are also putting pressure on indigenous people. In the Amazon basin 412 dams are being built, with 242 of these in Brazil alone.President Obama at COP15 in Copenhagen, 2009 Image Credit: Official Whitehouse PhotoCONCLUSION It has been over 23 years since the UNFCCC treaty was established to \"stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\". We have endured years of COP negotiations, promises, distant targets and shattered hope.On the road to Paris I am reminded of the expectations of COP15 in Copenhagen, 2009. Our hopes were high, and they were dashed. World leaders failed to deliver a comprehensive, legally binding, global climate change treaty. We can't let this happen again when world leaders meet in Paris in December. Paris is our last chance, the final opportunity to address the greatest threat of our time.At this critical juncture in history world leaders should reflect on Winston Churchill's address to Parliament on the eve of the Second World War: \"The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\"I hope that world leaders attending COP21 will listen to Pope Francis, act with courage and conviction and emerge from the conference with an agreement that, in the words of the Pope, \"protects our common home\" and \"brings the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development\", to preserve \"resources for present and future generations\"."}, {"title": "Here's How To Beat The Heat -- Fight Forest Fires With Fire", "text": "Thanks to the brutal fires raging in states like Washington and California, 2015 will go down as one of the most destructive years from wildfires.Compared with the last 10 years, when there were more than 57,000 fires on average by this point in the year, there have been only 47,000 fires in 2015, according to the Forest Service. But this year's fires have devoured 8.9 million acres, compared with 6.1 million acres on average. This year stands out even more, because 2014 and 2013 were relatively quiet, with below-average numbers of fires and acres burned.“So far, by some measures, it’s been one of the worst fire seasons we’ve had,” said Tom Harbour, Forest Service director of fire and aviation management. Harbour, a 45-year veteran of the Forest Service, added: “Fire season is never over anymore. It’s year-round.”There seems to be smoke everywhere in the West. More acres have burned in Washington state than ever, thanks to enormous fires like the North Star fire, which blackened 218,000 acres through Tuesday. Alaska is emerging from a record-setting season that saw 5.1 million acres go up in smoke. The Valley and Butte fires in northern California destroyed more than 1,000 homes.Climactic factors are largely to blame, scientists say. Trees, shrubs and other fuel are ready to burst into flames because of higher temperatures and prolonged periods of drought. California’s been hit with pervasive drought for four years. Who knows which region will next have to pray for rain?“There’s a future where it looks like we’re going to have an increasing number of large fires that pose a threat to our communities,” said Harbour.Extinguishing every fire is a strategy that carries enormous costs. This summer, the Forest Service spent $200 million a week battling fires, Oregon TV station KGW reported.The Forest Service has reshaped itself as fires have become more severe and more frequent. In 1985, 16 percent of its budget went to fighting fires. This year, fires ate up 52 percent of the budget. Fire personal made up about 25 percent of Forest Service employees in 1990. Today, they are more than half the workforce.“They do a great job in fire suppressions. They’re trying to keep people as safe as possible, which is quite remarkable,” said University of California, Berkeley, professor Scott Stephens. He co-authored an article entitled “Reform forest fire management” in Science magazine last week that warned of what would happen if officials didn’t balance fire suppression with controlled burns and thinning dense areas of growth.”We’re going to be chasing forest fires in cycles forever,” Stephens said, unless forest fire managers integrate controlled burns and systematic thinning of forests into their repertoire.To a certain extent, those policies are on the books. They’re just overlooked in favor of suppression, experts said.It’s not all bad news. Scientists point to strategies that should be emulated across the board. As dire as this year has been, some officials had the foresight to plan for a hot and dry 2015.Cal Fire, California’s forest fire department, staffed up with additional firefighters earlier than usual this year, thanks to emergency drought measures enacted by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) last year. The department also brought in extra helicopters and other firefighting equipment.“It’s allowed us to be able to meet the increase in fires,” said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant. “Without a doubt it’s been an extremely busy year.”Some cities and towns set among tinderbox conditions have taken matters into their own hands as they seek long-term precautions, said the Nature Conservancy’s Christopher Topik.Several fires over Labor Day 2011 devastated Austin, Texas. To avoid a repeat, the city and surrounding area are trying clear wood that would fuel fires and to eliminate other hazards.Ashland, Oregon, sits on the edge of a vast forest where fires are frequent. Officials there inform residents of the risks by making door-to-door visits to distribute material and answer questions.Prescribed burns, or intentionally set fires, are an underused tool for rejuvenating forests, according to fire experts. Many officials worry about losing control of a blaze, though fire managers in the South apparently aren’t as jittery about letting go of a fire. The Ozark National Forest in Arkansas boasts diverse flora, according to Topik, because of success there with controlled burns.“They never lost the culture of burning,” said Topik, Nature Conservancy’s director of restoring America’s forests. “It’s like a reference on what we want.”There’s a real risk of, course, that something could go wrong when you’re literally playing with fire.An infamous example was the 2000 Cerro Grande fire, a controlled burn that ran amok in New Mexico and damaged hundreds of homes. It heightened fears as it burned faculties at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which houses nuclear material. Luckily, no radiation leaked.There are actually too many trees these days, according to scientists. Parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains, which are plagued by fires, have 400 big trees per acre, according to Stephens, of UC, Berkeley. A hundred years ago, there were to 50 to 60. Fires spread slower and over less territory in conditions like that. Thinning dense growth ought to be a priority, Stephens and others researchers said.The Science article writers didn’t acknowledge that these suggestions already formed Forest Service policy, Harbour said. Over the last 10 years, the Forest Service has treated 25 million acres via prescribed burns and restorations to make them more fire-resistant. That’s out of approximately 200 million acres under Forest Service protection -- a drop in the bucket, according to critics.“There are restoration programs going on, but the scale of it is quite limited relative to the need,” said Jerry Franklin, a University of Washington professor and co-author of the Science article.An unusual controversy broke out after the publication of the article, and the Forest Service distanced itself from the paper, even though it was co-written by Malcolm North, one of their own ecologists.The Forest Service disapproved of North making policy recommendations. Science added a disclaimer saying the article didn’t reflect official Forest Service positions. The Forest Service didn’t make North available for an interview with The Huffington Post.This used to be the time of year where federal, state and local firefighters could count on cooler temperatures to help bring raging fires back under control. In a few weeks, higher elevations may even start seeing snow. But the burning season extends deeper into the fall each year.“We need to prevent the new normal from being even worse,” said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California. “We’re dealing with a very different situation.”"}, {"title": "Here Are A Few Things We Can Call Climate Change Deniers, Since AP Wants A New Term", "text": "The Associated Press style guide is followed by major news organizations around the world and helps shape the contours of political debate in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, the AP Stylebook is the subject of fierce of lobbying by partisans of every imaginable issue. On Tuesday, it succumbed to pressure from the climate change denial movement and announced it will no longer refer to deniers as \"deniers\" or \"skeptics.\"\"Scientists who consider themselves real skeptics -- who debunk mysticism, ESP and other pseudoscience, such as those who are part of the Center for Skeptical Inquiry -- complain that non-scientists who reject mainstream climate science have usurped the phrase skeptic. They say they aren’t skeptics because 'proper skepticism promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims,'\" Stylebook editors Sally Jacobsen, Dave Minthorn and Paula Froke explained. \"But those who reject climate science say the phrase denier has the pejorative ring of Holocaust denier so The Associated Press prefers climate change doubter or someone who rejects mainstream science.\"Skeptic, indeed, has never been a good term. It was always an attempt to be polite to people outright denying the science by giving them some patina of thoughtfulness. But it was never really true; skeptics, overall, were simply denying that climate change was happening or, more recently, since it's now obvious to anybody alive, denying that people are causing it. So kudos to AP for discarding skeptics.But the motivation behind shedding the term denier is a deeply strange one: Because it hurts their feelings?To call them \"doubters,\" though, is almost always simply false. It presumes knowledge of somebody's state of mind, but more often is just inaccurate. Take Exxon: We learned just recently that Exxon has known for a scientific fact since 1982 that fossil fuels were driving catastrophic climate change. Exxon's scientists did not \"doubt\" this fact. Nor did its executives who were read in on the science. Rather, they spent a fortune to -- I'm trying to find the right word here -- say that what was true was not actually true.AP's deference to the deniers is all the more strange for how it would sound in a different context. Would we talk about gravity doubters? What about people who doubt the link between smoking and lung cancer? In no other circumstance would the complete rejection of science be treated so gently. And it is only being done because, over the past decade, under intense pressure, an entire political party has embraced denialism. (Even a decade ago, climate change was broadly accepted within the GOP. Remember Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi on the couch?)So if doubters is wrong, what can we offer AP instead?Folks on Twitter variously suggested Armageddon advocates, drought enthusiasts, Canadian land speculators, climate itsallrightists, death cult members, grandchildren haters, slowcooking specialists, reality challenged and a variety of other phrases that would probably be seen as pejorative.At HuffPost, we'll continue to call people who deny science \"deniers\" (when we're being charitable). But if you have other ideas, feel free to share them with The Associated Press. They have a Twitter handle that's pretty easy to remember: @AP.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Associated Press Stops Calling Those Who Deny Climate Change 'Deniers'", "text": "The Associated Press, which sets editorial guidelines followed by media outlets around the world, ruffled a few feathers on Tuesday when it announced it would no longer call those who reject climate change \"deniers\" or \"skeptics.\"New guidance in its official AP Stylebook is to use \"climate change doubters\" or \"those who reject mainstream climate science.\" The wire service explained on its blog that the change was made to appease both those who question climate change's existence and scientists who identify themselves as skeptical of actual unsupported scientific claims.Some background on the change: Scientists who consider themselves real skeptics -- who debunk mysticism, ESP and other pseudoscience, such as those who are part of the Center for Skeptical Inquiry -- complain that non-scientists who reject mainstream climate science have usurped the phrase skeptic. They say they aren’t skeptics because “proper skepticism promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims.” That group prefers the phrase “climate change deniers” for those who reject accepted global warming data and theory. But those who reject climate science say the phrase denier has the pejorative ring of Holocaust denier so The Associated Press prefers climate change doubter or someone who rejects mainstream science.The Center for Skeptical Inquiry, which lobbied for media outlets to drop \"skeptic\" in a letter signed by Bill Nye and other prominent scientists because it says the term only applies to those who use \"reason and evidence to reach conclusions,\" applauded AP's change, but didn't support replacing it with \"doubter.\"\"The AP's journalism is read throughout the world, and heavily influences the public's understanding of crucial issues such as climate change,\" Ronald A. Lindsay, president and CEO of the Center for Skeptical Inquiry, said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. \"Referring to deniers as 'doubters' still imbues those who reject scientific fact with an intellectual legitimacy they have not earned. The general public, we fear, will still not get a clear picture of which public figures are basing their positions on reality, and which are not.\"The center did endorse the use of AP's second, wordier suggestion, \"those who reject mainstream climate science.\"Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for the environmental group 350.org, told HuffPost that the word \"doubt\" gives climate change deniers too much credit.\"Defying 90+% of scientific consensus on something isn't a well-reasoned act of 'doubt' -- it's an irrational act of 'denial,'\" Ganapathy wrote in an email. \"Doubt seems to imply a lack of clarity -- and there is a lack of clarity on some things, like what the ideal solution to climate change is, but there's zero lack of clarity on whether or not it's happening.\"Greenpeace spokesman Joe Smyth had a similar view.\"The explanation for why the phrase 'climate deniers doesn't fit is unconvincing,\" he told HuffPost. \"It basically seems to boil down to that it hurts some climate science deniers' feelings.\"Several journalists, including some who might be expected to abide by the new language in their newsrooms, snarked at the change.\"In this case ... they have succumbed to a specious argument that the term 'denier' can’t be paired with another term without tinging it with Holocaust implications,\" columnist Erik Wemple wrote in The Washington Post. \"Seems like a dicey precedent.\""}, {"title": "A Key Element for the Forthcoming Paris Climate Agreement", "text": "The upcoming Paris climate negotiations will constitute a critical step in the ongoing international process to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The question of whether the Paris outcome will be sufficiently ambitious to put the world on a path towards limiting global average warming to 2 C, as agreed in Cancun, can be answered now. It will not, because that target, while possibly useful as an aspirational goal, is not achievable, as the most recent report of Working Group III of the IPCC documented. What is clear, however, is that greater ambition is more easily realized when costs are low. Market-based mechanisms are an important element in the portfolio of actions that can lead to cost-effective solutions. Linkage — between and among market and non-market systems for reducing GHG emissions — is a closely-related key element.In an article just published in Climate Policy, \"Facilitating Linkage of Climate Policies through the Paris Outcome,\" my co-authors — Daniel Bodansky of Arizona State University, Seth Hoedl of Harvard Law School, and Gilbert Metcalf of Tufts University — and I examine how the Paris outcome, and more generally the ongoing climate negotiations, can allow for and advance linked systems.Brief BackgroundIn the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2011, the parties agreed to develop a \"protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties,\" for adoption at COP-21 in December, 2015, in Paris. It is likely that the Paris outcome will reflect a hybrid climate policy architecture — one that combines top-down elements, such as for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV), with bottom-up elements, including \"Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\" (INDCs), describing what a country intends to do to reduce emissions, based on domestic political feasibility and other factors. This outcome will be embodied in a core agreement, which likely will be legally binding, as well as ancillary instruments such as annexes, national schedules, and COP decisions.The ability to link regional, national, and sub-national climate policies will be essential to enhancing the cost-effectiveness of such a system — and thus the likelihood of achieving significant global emissions reductions. By \"linkage\", we mean formal recognition by a GHG mitigation program in one jurisdiction (a regional, national, or sub-national government) of emission reductions undertaken in another jurisdiction for the purposes of complying with the first jurisdiction's requirements.First Necessity for Paris: Do No HarmThe minimum requirement for the Paris agreement in regard to linkage is to do no harm. Silence on linkage could possibly accomplish that. But any provisions in the agreement that would require nations to achieve their respective INDCs exclusively within their own borders — a constraint that has been favored by the ALBA countries — would, in effect, prohibit not only international carbon markets but any sort of meaningful linkage (and would thereby greatly drive up costs).Common Definitions of Key TermsIf linkage is to play a significant role in a hybrid international policy architecture, then several categories of design elements merit serious consideration for inclusion in the Paris outcome, either directly or by establishing a process for subsequent international negotiations. In general, effective linkage requires common definitions of key terms, including particularly the units to be used for compliance purposes. This will be particularly important for links between heterogeneous systems, and it is an area where a model rule could be particularly helpful (more about this below).Registries and TrackingLinkage requires registries and tracking mechanisms, whether the systems being linked are homogeneous or heterogeneous. Indeed, a key role for the top-down part of a hybrid architecture that allows for international linkage of national policy instruments will be the tracking, reporting, and recording of allowance unit transactions.International compliance units would make the functioning of an international transaction log more straightforward and reduce the administrative burden of reconciling international registries with national registries. Minimum standards for approving and measuring offsets may be important. Market oversight and monitoring may increase confidence in the system, although in some cases, national and international institutions that can provide oversight already exist and may need only relatively minor additional capacity to assume these functions.Too Much of a Good Thing Can be BadIncluding detailed linkage rules in the core agreement is not desirable as this could make it difficult for rules to evolve in light of experience. Instead, minimum standards to ensure environmental integrity should be elaborated in COP decisions, or by other means; for example, the COP could establish minimum requirements for national monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV), registries, and crediting mechanisms.In terms of linkage, the function of the core agreement might be confined to articulating general principles relating to environmental integrity, while also authorizing the COP or another organization to develop more detailed rules. Whatever minimum standards are adopted, oversight of compliance will be important to ensure the integrity both of the Paris outcome and of linked national systems.The Utility of Default or Model RulesMany elements of GHG linkage can be addressed through default or model rules from which nations are free to deviate at their discretion. Rules that may benefit from this approach are typically concerned with the details of linking two regulatory systems. For example, nations interested in linking their cap-and-trade systems would have to consider rules for market coverage, cost containment, banking and borrowing, compliance periods, allocation methods, and the treatment of new emitters and emitter closures. Additional rules may be needed for linking of heterogeneous systems.Developing uniform rules to address all of these issues is unrealistic. Instead, a degree of harmonization could be achieved through default rules that facilitate linkage by providing a common framework for nations to use when developing their own linkage agreements. Although there is no need for the core agreement itself to elaborate harmonized linkage rules, it might authorize the COP to develop default linkage rules that nations can use in negotiating bilateral linkage agreements.Less is MoreIn our Climate Policy article, Dan Bodansky, Seth Hoedl, Gib Metcalf, and I conclude that the most valuable outcome of Paris regarding linkage might simply be the inclusion in the core agreement of an explicit statement that parties may transfer portions of their INDCs to other parties and that these transferred units may be used by the transferees to implement their INDCs. Such a statement would help provide certainty both to governments and private market participants. This minimalist approach will allow diverse forms of linkage to arise, among what will inevitably be highly heterogeneous INDCs, thereby advancing the dual objectives of cost effectiveness and environmental integrity in the international climate policy regime."}, {"title": "GRAPHIC: Diver Attacked By Shark Takes Gruesome Selfie", "text": "Braxton Rocha was badly wounded by a shark two days ago, but that didn't stop him from posting a very graphic selfie of the wound.The 27-year-old was spearfishing in waters 60 yards off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island on Sunday when a 13-foot tiger shark bit his left leg, according the the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.Rocha reportedly swam back to shore after the attack and a friend called for help.

I think it's important to start out by letting you know that I was not one of the people opposed to you getting a second chance. I was also not one of the people who called for a boycott of the NFL.My wife and I did adopt one of the dogs that was rescued from your Virginia property back in 2007 though. The rescuers named him Hector, and he was featured in media across the country. I did my best not to talk out against you throughout the process because I was hoping that you would learn that what you did was wrong, why it was wrong, and become one of the best advocates for the cause.Photo: Printz PhotographyI knew it was going to be a media circus at first, and figured you would do what you needed to do in order to get your life back. In the meantime, I felt it was very important for at least one of the dogs to succeed to help others in the future. Fortunately, many were given that chance and went on to do amazing things.I'm thankful to have been a part of that success by adopting Hector, who became a Certified Therapy Dog within a year of coming to live with us. He brought smiles to people staying in hospitals and nursing homes. He loved kids, and was a great friendly demo dog for when we would visit schools and talk to the children about dog bite prevention. He was always a trooper with people putting cameras in his face, even though he had no clue what any of it was about.Despite the scars from his previous life, Hector lived happily integrated in our multi-dog household, and had many other canine friends as well. He was truly an amazing dog and I feel grateful to all the people involved in his rescue for giving us the chance to have him as part of our family.Photo: Joshua GrenellYou did your time, and got your second chance. I recognize that you've done some good things since getting out of prison, and according to your first interview after your release you now feel horrible about the situation. However, unanswered questions still remain that I feel deserve to be resolved. Why have you not reached out to the people who stepped up to clean up your mess in the first place?The organizations who initially fought for the dogs to get a chance at a better life, and the people like me and my wife who took the dogs into our homes to make sure they never had to go through that again? Why did you refuse the opportunity to meet with some of your former dogs when it was offered to you in a controlled environment that would have satisfied all the legal issues at the time? You used the legal issues as an excuse, but those don't apply anymore, and you still have yet to show any interest in reconciliation.Also, when you were legally allowed to own a dog again, why did you want to buy a Malinois instead of rescue a pit bull to help undo the horrific acts that you took part in and others continue to do today? The fact that these questions have legitimacy and remain unanswered is why a lot of people still don't like or respect you. It's not because they don't want you to play football anymore, or because they're all a bunch of crazy people who are out to get you. It's because these people know that for one reason or another you haven't found the courage to reconcile with the actual situation that caused all of this in the first place.I have no doubt that Hector would have walked up to you with his tail wagging, but that can't happen anymore. After approximately two years on your property and seven years of a better life, he passed away last October. At the end of his life, he battled health issues we believe were brought on by his time with you.A number of the other dogs have recently passed away from similar issues as well. But maybe this is what you're waiting for. For all the dogs to pass away in hopes that everything will start to fade away. I hope not, and I don't really see that happening anyway. The Internet will keep their stories alive and well long after their bodies are gone.Regardless, the dogs deserve your respect, and you have yet to show it. They are the victims that overcame this situation, not you. They were the ones who truly had no choice, not you. You can continue to spin things and brush it all under the rug with a well-paid PR firm, but until you face those involved with the actual situation, you'll continue to be a coward who's simply running away from his victims.Sincerely,Andrew \"Roo\" YoriP.S. -- Since Hector's passing, thousands of people have donated at least $7 to the Hector Fund for Wallace the Pit Bull Foundation to help abused, neglected, and homeless dogs get the chance at a better life. I invite you to join them. I think it would be a good place for you to start to make amends with the actual situation.

In 2015, civil society's ideas, talents and passion are needed more than ever.The 2015 NGO Conference at the United Nations harnessed civil society's energy while celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the UN. The three-day conference stayed true to its theme: Honoring the Past, Recognizing the Present, and Imagining the Future. International civil society constituencies and NGO stakeholders gathered to celebrate their successes and leaders over the years, and provide an opportunity to build civil society's capacity to implement the UN's post-2015 agenda of the new sustainable development goals (SDGs). I learned a great deal from each and every speaker and panel.It was truly a privilege to speak at this important convening of minds; about my father, Ted Turner's, legacy and his continuing support of the United Nations through the years, as well as the ambitious and achievable 2030 SDGs.On August 2, 2015, after a negotiating process that spanned more than two years and featured unprecedented participation of civil society, governments united behind an agenda that features 17 SDGs that aim to end poverty, combat inequalities and promote prosperity while protecting the environment by 2030. I believe this plan for collective action will transform the fate of humanity by addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, striving to stay in harmony with our planet, and meeting the universal need for development that works for all people. It will foster peaceful and just societies, amplify voices around the world, and require communication and participation of all governments, stakeholders and people.My dad has long believed that communication is essential to bring people to higher levels of cooperation and understanding, to elevate people's voices and to advance humanity. That's why in 1997, he announced a one billion dollar gift to the UN and created the United Nations Foundation. At the conference, I had the great honor of presenting a dear family friend, and the Chairman of the Global Partnerships Forum, Amir Dossal, with an award for his many years of public service and partnership building. Amir has served as the UN's Chief Liaison for my father's donation, which involves 450 programs and projects in the areas of children's health, women and population, climate change and biodiversity. Since joining the UN in 1985, Amir has led a number of global initiatives aiding the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which included eradicating extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, and fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS. Amir also served as the executive director for the UN Office for Partnerships from 2005-2010. My family is deeply grateful for his many years of service and we consider it a blessing to be in his circle of friends.The conference also cast an eye to the future by recognizing the importance of the bright, innovative minds of younger generations and how we must pass on leadership to our youth. We heard from Girl Rising and Half the Sky ambassador Hadia Sheerazi, who discussed gender equality and the vital role the 1.8 billion youth around the world play and whose voices are not often heard in the General Assembly. I also (proudly!) shared the podium with my son, John R., who spoke to his experience working for the UN Foundation and his thoughts on how technology and youth will play critical roles in advancing the 2030 SDGs. John R. cited the innovative Charity Miles app which makes it easy for everyone to become an everyday philanthropist and give back.Jonathan Granoff, President of the Global Security Institute, moderated a panel titled: Showcasing Successes and Lessons Learned: Celebrating 70 Years of Civil Society at the UN. Jonathan argued that it's existential that we protect the climate, our oceans' acid and PH balance and our rainforests, and reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. These are not lifestyle options, but great threats to the survival of humanity which cannot be solved without global cooperation. His points were particularly poignant, and capture the focus of the conference well.\"And those of you working in human rights, and those of you working in gender equality, and those of you working on poverty elimination, and those of you working on the abolition of nuclear weapons, and those of you working on balancing the climate,\" said Jonathan. \"All of these issues come down to the application of the golden rule: states must treat other states as they want to be treated. The issues will not be led by states. There have to be global advocates. And who are the global advocates?

The AQICN map, which automatically updates every 15 minutes, compiles verified data from official environmental protection agencies about 1,000 locations, and displays each site's air quality index on the map. Users can see a full report and breakdown of a location’s air quality and pollution forecast by clicking on one of the flags.The indices are based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index scale, which measures five major air pollutants (ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide) to calculate a location's air quality and the possible health effects. Each site is color-coded to display its current level of pollution according to the scale, which can be seen below.The data is by no means complete, however. Most of Central Asia and almost all of sub-Saharan Africa lack information on air quality. However, AQICN aims to increase its station coverage by 10 to 20 percent a year, according to the group's website.AQICN's new map launches as international researchers sound louder alarms about air pollution's profound health effects in China -- where 4,400 people die from air pollution each day, according to an August 2015 study by the U.S. nonprofit Berkeley Earth.

The DC service will focus specifically on climate change, according to Rabbi Arthur Waskow, who founded The Shalom Center and organized the event with Rabbi Mordechai Liebling, director of the Social Justice Organizing Program at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.\"We'll be atoning for the way in which the human race has treated the Earth, especially in the last hundred years or so,\" Waskow told The Huffington Post.While the service is happening, Pope Francis will be making appearances around the city and gearing up for his address to Congress on Thursday, Sept. 24. The Catholic leader's visit comes at an important time for faith communities working on climate justice, Waskow said.\"The fact that the pope has spoken out so powerfully and so clearly [on climate change], and the fact that he is going to be speaking at the UN and Congress and meeting with the president, means that the work many of us have been doing for years is on the front page,\" Waskow told HuffPost.Climate change is an issue close to Waskow's heart. The rabbi was one of seven Jewish leaders across denominations who wrote a statement on the climate crisis earlier this year to coincide with the release of the pope's encyclical on the environment. More than 400 rabbis had signed the declaration as of late August, according to the Shalom Center.\"We call for a new sense of eco-social justice – a tikkun olam that includes tikkun tevel, the healing of our planet,\" the statement read. \"We urge those who have been focusing on social justice to address the climate crisis, and those who have been focusing on the climate crisis to address social justice.\"The Yom Kippur service at Lincoln Memorial will weave in not only passages from this rabbinic statement on climate change, but also portions of the pope's encyclical, Waskow said.\"Just as we developed the rabbinic letter, many different religious and spiritual communities are developing out of their own theology and tradition positions and views which come out to be fairly similar,\" Waskow told HuffPost. The pope's unwavering emphasis on caring for creation \"takes the work we're doing it and gives it front and center place in people's consciousness.\"The service will include the traditional Kol Nidre prayer, sung at the start of Yom Kippur, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Wednesday's portion will begin at 10 a.m. and include Torah readings and commentary.

Clinton has been tight-lipped about it on the campaign trail, saying she would wait for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry's decision before weighing in.But last week, Clinton said she was going to make an announcement \"soon.\"\"I'm putting the White House on notice,\" the former secretary of state said at the time. \"I'm going to tell you what I think soon, because I can't wait.\"An aide to the Clinton campaign told The Huffington Post on background that Clinton had refrained from making her position public because, as the former secretary of state, \"she is in a unique position compared to other candidates.\"\"As she has said previously, she wanted to respect the president's timetable for making a decision and give her successor, Secretary Kerry, the space to conduct a thorough process,\" said the aide. \"However, when she launched her campaign earlier this year, she expected a decision would have been made before now. Now Clinton feels she owes it to the American people to make it clear where she stands on this issue, as she has heard from Americans across the country who care deeply about this issue and who want to know the opinions of the candidates running for office.\"The aide said that the Clinton campaign briefed the White House on her position before she came out publicly.Clinton said in her Tuesday speech that she will offer a \"plan for a North American approach to fighting climate change and clean energy\" in the coming days.\"For me, we need to be transitioning from fossil fuels,\" she said, but added that it will \"take time\" to transition to renewable energy. \"That's why I led with my two big proposals: I want to see us in my first term install a half a billion solar panels, and in my second term have enough clean power to run all the homes in America,\" she said.Fellow Democratic candidate Sen.

Vermont is too far away. Plus, we don't hear words like \"refugee\" or \"IDP\" in reference to the thousands of Americans displaced by the California fires. We generally save the language of climate crisis and social upheaval for more far away places.But those Californian families whose homes were destroyed by the Valley Fire are \"internally displaced people.\" These \"refugees\" seek refuge. Maybe they haven't traveled far, but they know something about the words \"migrant\" and \"crisis.\"Eventually we'll use this vocabulary in new ways in our conversations about this country's experience of climate change. And I imagine that eventually lots of people will be displaced, seek refuge, and migrate even to Vermont, where I live. The ground is still high. The trees are still green. Winter still comes.I recently traveled from Vermont to California, to attend a wedding in a Calistoga vineyard not far from where the Valley Fire now roars. The day before the ceremony I played golf with the groom-to-be at the course by the fairgrounds and racetrack. No golfer, I shanked a few, including at least one ball that shot off into the Calistoga Speedway. It's in that racetrack where we can now see the homeless gathered, families whose homes are now in ashes. In one news clip, the fire chief tells the displaced people at the racetrack that the cause of the fire is still under investigation.That's what I remember Channel 8 News saying about other fires when I was there in August.\" The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\"Before we went to wine country for the wedding, we spent a few days in creek-less Walnut Creek. I'd go jogging in the morning among the houses, along the dry streambeds. Many people continue to water their lawns daily. From the porches of homes with the greenest lawns American flags waved in defiant drought-be-damned nationalism.After the wedding, my wife drove us down the freeway and I read Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything. I heard the News 8 anchor in my head. \"The cause of the fire is under investigation.\" Oh please, I thought. The cause is waving flags and watering lawns back there by the non-creek.

Napa vineyards burn and grapes come to Vermont pastures. It's bizarre. But climate change is like that.Vermont Pinot. Californian refugees. And I wonder what the future IDP situation will be like here on the east coast. Will Vermont need to make room for sea rise refugees from Boston, Bridgeport, Brooklyn? How many? When? Hard to predict. Climate change is like that.And the ticks. Climate change is terrifying - and it's also annoying. I worry about ticks on my boys' ankles when they go play in the field - I mean, future vineyard. When I was growing up in central Vermont we didn't have to worry about ticks.

Coupled with the \"Arab Spring\" the region seemed to be experiencing a promising time; young and old were revolting for democracy and justice. While the other countries ousted their violent dictators, Syria found itself trapped in a bloodbath. The last four and a half years have left thousands displaced and hundreds of thousands dead. Now we are witnessing the largest refugee migration since World War II.When considering the timeline of events, it is quite possible that what is happening can be linked back to one important factor -- access to fresh water.Reporters and Middle East experts have made links between the Syrian civil war and dry farmlands - some noting that those who would have had their hands in the dirt are now left with no opportunity than to put their hands on guns. Now, nearly five years later, we are witnessing a massive migration of refugees fleeing their bloodstained nation, seeking safety and refuge in Europe and beyond.Water wars are not a new conflict. Climate change is not causing water wars, but climate change could increase the frequency in which we experience conflict and displacement because of widespread, long-term droughts.If drought does have something to do with Syria's incredibly devastating war and mass migration, we must wonder if other drought stricken regions are at risk of increased violence and displacement.From Syria, to California, to São Paulo - a lack of access to fresh water is becoming all too common across the globe. The state of São Paulo, with a population of 44 million, is experiencing its most significant drought in 80 years. People are already protesting water rationing and lack of government oversight. Civil unrest is bound to take hold in São Paulo as taps continue to run dry and the government turns to military involvement to control the situation.Meanwhile, California is a tinderbox that has not seen this level of dryness for 500 years. Porterville, a predominately Latino area that was once flourishing farmland, is home to more than a thousand residents without running water. Local drought centers are offering communal showers, and many residents have to pay for gallons of bottled water. This is not a long-term, sustainable solution. Eventually, they will have no choice but to pack up their bags and leave.With trends toward increased populations, sprawling cities, water guzzling industries, and expanded military operations, there is a dire need for policymakers to assess these unpredictable, volatile situations that are displacing people in record numbers.If drought is intensifying mass displacement and civil unrest, what are the solutions?"}, {"title": "This Landlord Will Only Rent To Tenants Who Have Pit Bulls", "text": "Kara Montalbano is looking for some new tenants for her quiet three-bedroom home in Providence, Rhode Island.

He said officials are planning to improve control over the area to avoid a similar situation in the future.With its black volcanic sand, Ostional Wildlife Refuge is one of the world's most important nesting sites for the olive ridley sea turtle -- one of the few sea turtles that synchronize nesting behaviors en masse. Over the course of a five-day arribada, adult turtles leave up to 10 million eggs on the beach of Ostional.While listed as a vulnerable species, the olive ridley sea turtle is considered the most abundant sea turtle in the world. An estimated 800,000 females nest annually, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

It contains deposits of nearly 865,000 varieties of seeds buried within a mountain in case of catastrophe. Due to Syria's civil war, it will now allow a withdrawal of its contents for the first time in its existence.The request to take out a small amount of the millions of total seeds from within the Svalbard Global Seed Vault comes from another gene bank, the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, which is currently based in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, but was previously headquartered in Syria.One reason gene banks exist is to provide breeders, scientists and farmers with seed varieties to improve crop growth and yields in the face of changing climates. Amid Syria's brutal civil war, however, ICARDA has struggled to provide this function.As it's become more and more difficult for the organization to handle requests for seeds from its former headquarters in Aleppo, spokesman Brian Lainoff of the Crop Trust that runs the Global Seed Vault explained that ICARDA has requested to get some of its deposits back from Svalbard.\"ICARDA has worked extremely hard and with extreme dedication to try and do their best during this time,\" Lainoff told The WorldPost.ICARDA's requested seeds won't go back to Syria, but to a safer location outside of the country.Numerous seed vault collections exist around the world to maintain biodiversity and food security in the event that disaster of any kind wipes out a crop variety. The Svalbard vault acts as a sort of last-resort insurance policy in addition to those collections.\"If something were to happen to one of those collections around the world, they can always come back to the seed vault and retrieve what might have been lost,\" Lainoff says.The vault was established in 2008, and is built to survive rising sea levels, power outages and other calamities that could affect the seeds. Its main storage area is kept well below freezing to preserve the contents, and it can hold 4.5 million varieties.\"There are seeds in the vault that have originated from nearly if not every single country,\" Lainoff says. \"It really is kind of the only example of true international cooperation. There's seeds sitting on the same shelf from North Korea and South Korea, and they get along just fine up there.\"Around 500 seeds of each variety are contained within the vault, according to Lainoff, and the different varieties are key to genetic resistance against potential disease that could affect the world's major crops.What has caused the first withdrawal from the global vault is man-made, however, as fighting between the Syrian government and rebel groups, as well attacks from Islamic State militants, have devastated the country. The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands and forced more than 4 million people to become refugees.ICARDA managed to move its headquarters from Syria in the early days of the war, while some of its workers remained at the gene bank in Aleppo in an attempt to save the collection. The organization managed to duplicate 80 percent of its collection in Svalbard as of March this year, where the seeds were safely stored along with others from around the world.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "4 Reasons You Should Care About Energy Efficiency", "text": "It's easy to understand why renewable energy receives most of the press. Photos and videos of sunsets reflecting off solar panels, or wind turbines spinning across a scenic field, make for great and compelling imagery for reporters to use in their articles and TV reports.A less-understood, less-covered, but equally important element of the current U.S. energy evolution is energy efficiency.I know what you're thinking: that's old news. Jimmy Carter pushed energy efficiency in the 1970s, and Americans were too lazy and certainly not ready to take his message to heart. Fair enough. So why is now different? Even if your friends and family roll their eyes at the idea of energy efficiency, the benefits remain. Here are four facts about energy efficiency that should make you pay attention.1) Companies in the energy-efficiency industry are innovative, well supported and, best of all, huge job creators.The United States economy is still recovering from 2008's economic collapse. To continue its growth, creative companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to employ people domestically will fuel the economy's return to full strength.Did you know companies in the energy efficiency space meet all those criteria?\"There's tremendous opportunity to develop new business models that leverage the innovations in energy efficiency technology,\" says Jason Gates of Compology, a San Francisco-based company that produces energy efficiency management equipment for the waste management industry. \"For a business to succeed in energy efficiency, the economics have to make sense when compared to other offerings in the same category. The smart companies are figuring out how to do that.\"Investors are placing their money on behind-the-meter technology, including control systems, monitoring programs and storage capabilities. Entrepreneurs with similar experience in other industries are joining the race toward the next big breakthrough, and are hiring innovative thinkers to join them. The energy efficiency industry will play a huge role in adding jobs to a recovering economy.2) Businesses are discovering energy efficiency investments provide a higher and faster return-on-investment (ROI).Once businesses discover how much money is escaping through energy system inefficiencies, they start investigating energy efficiency. With new command-and-control software linking all of the energy-assets within a site, facility managers can control energy distribution precisely. Think of it this way: Now facility managers can do with massive energy systems what homeowners are already doing through technology like the Nest thermostat and LED light bulbs.For example, consider a pick-up and delivery service with 40 box trucks, each with approximately a 40-gallon tank. The largest energy cost for this business is diesel or natural gas that only get around 10 miles per gallon. At the national average of $2.30/gallon for unleaded ($2.52/gallon for diesel), it costs the business $92 per each fill-up ($101 for diesel). With such low gas mileage, the energy costs add up quickly.Using an energy efficient dynamic routing system, similar to the platform developed by Compology, the company can reduce the number of trucks they need by up to 40%. The reduction in trucks to 24 reduces the fuel bill from $3,680 to $2,208 ($4,040 to $2,424 for diesel). In a business with tight margins, those savings are enormous.  3) Energy efficiency is easier to implement and operate than ever before.  Homeowners are discovering how easy it is to implement energy efficiency monitors like eMonitor and eGauge. These devices allow homeowners to see their energy use in real-time and adjust accordingly to lower their energy costs. Now, the same level of energy efficiency monitoring is available to facility managers at the largest and most complex and critical facilities. And the industry's leading companies will not only install the systems, but monitor them for their customers, too.\"It saves facility managers having to log into the system,\" says Tom Willie of Blue Pillar, a Frederick, MD-based company that provides Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and energy management technology to facilities. \"When an alert comes in, our software lets the manager know -- and their team can fix the problem before it becomes a crisis.\"How much easier can it get? Hire a company that is using innovative technology to create robust network systems. They will install it, monitor the equipment and energy use, and ensure the lights stay on at all times. It's a no-brainer.4) Energy efficiency is increasingly syncing with the fast-growing renewable energy industries.  As distributed generation continues to spread (i.e., businesses producing their own power on-site) with renewable energy like solar and wind, energy efficiency networks must be able to integrate into these systems. After all, renewable energy sources can't reduce climate change solely on their own. Storage and energy efficiency devices enhance, maximize and multiply the positive effects renewables have on carbon emissions -- these three pillars work best as a package.\"Energy storage devices improve self-consumption and provide distributed resources with the ability to offset grid fluctuations,\" says Greg Maguire, VP of Sales and Marketing at JuiceBox Energy. \"We believe that generating, storing and distributing electricity in your home will soon be as common as how we currently generate and store hot water in our homes today.\"Now that you have a better understanding of the critical role energy efficiency plays in your energy consumption, engage with an energy efficiency expert today to reap the benefits -- and then encourage your friends and family to do the same."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - September 22, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Volkswagen caught red-handed cheating on pollution standards; Exxon once thought about saving saving mankind, but funded climate change denial instead; Climate-denying Koch Brothers' favorite presidential candidate drops out; PLUS: Pope Francis is in the U.S. to talk morality and climate, and Republicans are freaking out...

With dams came mills. How many ponds on Long Island are named Mill Pond? We haven't needed mills since Edison. But the ponds are still there. They shouldn't be.Via Google MapsLet's take Sayville, where we have The Mill Pond. Not surprisingly, it's right on The Montauk Highway, which goes back to colonial times if it isn't a Native American trail. The pond is now in terrible shape, choked with algae and silt, and harboring an invasive species called phragmites, a reed that can only be killed by reverting the pond to a stream. Notice how there's a creek that goes north from the pond. That needs to be reconnected with the bay.Then on the other side, there's Lotus Lake, the last chain of a long series of artificial lakes created by cranberry farmers, but which today could be connected to the bay and revitalize a long since vanished habitat. Lotus too has a phragmites infestation. Imagine how full of life the resulting nature preserve would be, restoring these pockets of Long Island to what they once were.Both these branches form the estuary for Brown's River, meeting in a vast marsh at the very tip of Meadow Croft, the former estate of John E Roosevelt. Arguably, having water flowing freely through would help improve the habitat here and downstream as well.Taking down the dams and having the ponds revert to streams and marshes will accomplish the following:1. We can bring back the herring, alewife, chad and sturgeon and eel, all the fish that swim upriver to fresh water to spawn. Today, there is hardly a stream not blocked to them. We want those fish back in abundance.2.By opening up the streams to the bays they empty into, creating marshland where the former ponds were, we will have a defense against flooding. The water will have somewhere to go.3. The value of the land around these habitat restoration projects would increase. What were ponds become nature preserves. It's not only a great deal for homeowners, but they would also have the knowledge that they were part of a much larger project.This is not a small task. There are 100+ dams and spillways along the South Shore alone. None are big, but the consequences must be understood via an Environmental Impact Statement. Hopefully on that ledger would be the prospect of having fish runs in places that haven't had them in 250 years.Here's what is happening in Rhode Island -- they are taking down a dam on The Pawcatuck River. That is a $1,000,000 project overseen by The Nature Conservancy, and is much larger than the dams we find on Long Island, but we should see similar results -- a return of wildlife of all sorts, something a Long Island rapidly losing its natural beauty to pollution and overdevelopment, should embrace with open arms.Dam removal has to be a national priority. It should be as much a part of our infrastructure conversations as our roads, bridges, tunnels and rail. It is also crucial as an environmental issue. People think hydroelectric power is clean energy, but it wreaks havoc on the life of a river. Rivers need to run free.There's an art house documentary out called \"A River Between Us.\" It's about The Klamath River in Oregon, and the struggle to find common ground among all the different peoples living along its 1200 miles -- The Native Americans, The Cowboys, The Farmers, and the local leaders seeking to reach that resolution. It's a moving tale that offers us all the possibility that we can come together and overcome our differences to protect a common good.Four dams are to be removed, freeing up the river so that it could recover, so that the salmon could run upstream as they did for eons. The agreement is waiting either an Act of Congress or an Executive Order to become law. With that, nature can reclaim this river for future generations.We have insulted our waters with levees, outflow pipes, fertilizer and road run off, dumping, pesticides, and of course with dams. Nature can be very forgiving if its not too late. On Long Island, we have seen where just by installing a fish ladder on Carll's River at Argyle Lake, we got some alewife to come up -- Thanks, Seatuck! -- but we need to do that all over on Long Island, and with that become a model for what should be done everywhere."}, {"title": "Planning for Our Climate Future", "text": "Today I listened to a report on the impact of climate change on allergies in adults and children as a result of increased temperatures, changing moisture patterns, and accelerated growth and distribution of pollen to generate the symptoms of allergic reactions never before experienced. I am an example myself, this year for the first time, suffering from runny eyes, nose, and sneezing fits that can only be explained by unusual extreme climate phenomenon.I have resolved to waste no more time trying to counter the indifference of climate deniers whose blind biases are forever revealed as uninformed and or otherwise motivated by a self-interest that disables them from dealing with these very real changes in our environment and how, as a result, we must live. Climate is, as President Obama affirmed in his recent visit to Alaska and the Arctic, \"the defining issue of our time.\"\"Climate impacts and imperils on human and ecosystem health, food systems, energy production, the economy, geopolitics, and the future of storms, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme events.\" So writes Dr. Paul Andrew Mayewski, Director of the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine as an introduction to an innovative framework for climate futures planning, \"a transformative mechanism and platform for assessing and quantifying climate change, vulnerability, impacts, and opportunities that transcend models and predictions to take form as locale-specific, plausible scenarios that go beyond standard linear predictions.\"Dr. Mayewski knows whereof he speaks: he built the Climate Change Institute around deep ice cores and other samples extracted from the Arctic, Antarctic, glacial mountain ranges, lake sediments, and human artifacts, augmented by environmental monitoring systems, and analyzed in the lab to reveal their chemical make-up and the relative volume and speed at which over time the atmosphere has changed and revealed evidence of emissions and deposits that are singular proof of accelerated change, especially in the last one hundred years, now become manifest in everything we see around us from parched fields to empty streams to drinking water shortages to a sudden increase in ragweed pollen and allergic reactions.But the Institute has gone beyond the simple collection of data to create a powerful software that relates inputs and products to applications and communications, overlaying analyses of physical climate, air quality, and boundary conditions to assess impact, magnitude, and rates of change and to relate them to plausible scenarios, plans, and case histories that meet the immediate responsive needs of organizations and communities of any scale.The breadth of the data and its analytical potential can be applied to problems in \"climate reconstruction, changing human impacts, prediction, monitoring, advances in technology and cyber-infrastructure, applied information transfer, adaptation and sustainability, and natural climate impacts on humans and ecosystems,\" writes Dr. Mayewski. The point here is that the information derived from research and comparative study can be put to practical application in the planning of specific response to specific circumstance and the invention of new technical methods, new organizational structures, new political and economic management, and new social applications that will make a significant difference in our successful adaptation to the problems we now face.If we deny a complicated problem, then it is quite easy to ignore a complicated solution. We can deny the science, but it is precisely the alternative inquiry that has led us to the achievements that have characterized the beneficial growth of the modern age. But when the science tells us the old ways have reached a level where their consequence corrupts their benefit, then we should capitalize on that evidence to plan what will take us to an alternative, continuing or greater achievement. If climate is the defining issue of our time, how can we ignore or stand outside its definition? If ignorance is the rejection of meaning, then why would we choose meaningless as a certain way toward collapse and failure? The application of good science is the only way forward; the Climate Change Institute and the many other scientists and projects directed toward understanding, planning, and the application of knowledge are more than our best hope forward.Let's deny the deniers, use science to guide us, and get on with the future."}, {"title": "I Am the Walrus: What 35,000 Walruses Tell Us About Our Future in Warming World", "text": "The Beatles were right: \"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.\"We're all the walrus. And right now, things aren't going all that well. Over the past several weeks, some 35,000 Pacific walruses in Alaska have climbed out of the ocean -- where the Arctic sea ice they need to survive is disappearing at a break-neck pace -- and crowded themselves onto a beach.They're only the latest in a long-line of victims in the climate crisis. Arctic sea ice is now at its fourth-lowest level in recorded history (the lowest was in 2012), more than 700,000 square miles below average ice levels, an area bigger than the state of Alaska.Making matters worse is that, less than 100 miles from where the walruses have hauled out, Royal Dutch Shell is now drilling for oil despite overwhelming public opposition. President Obama approved this project even though there's a 75 percent chance of a major oil spill that would kill walruses, polar bears, and other vulnerable Arctic wildlife.But here's the truly maddening part. The disappearing sea ice is only increasing the accessibility of Chukchi waters to dirty drilling. So now that the planet is warming because we're burning too much fossil fuel, we can drill into the world's largest untapped pool of oil and burn that, which will accelerate the loss of ice at both poles and around the world, sending average global temperatures soaring.President Obama knows this, and he just spent four days in Alaska talking about it.\"We're not acting fast enough. I've come here today as the leader of the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter to say the United State recognizes our role in creating this problem and we embrace our responsibility to help solve it,\" Obama told an international conference of countries with interests in the Arctic.But if I am the walrus, even that urgent call to action may be too late for me, particularly without the actions to back them up. It's an incredibly dangerous situation when tens of thousands of walruses haul out of the ocean at the same spot at the same time, as we've seen in past years. If they get spooked or startled, they'll stampede back into the sea and hundreds will die, as we saw near this same spot in 2009. This phenomenon of massive walrus haul-outs has become common, but it only began in 2007, when Arctic sea ice took a precipitous drop.Global warming hasn't caused humans to take such desperate measures yet -- though some low-lying atolls and Alaska coastal villages are now readying for their imminent displacement, and there's even some reporting linking Syria's crisis to climate change -- but we know what's coming.The most widely cited estimate of \"climate refugees\" -- those displaced by rising seas, natural disasters, droughts, loss of food and water supplies, or other causes directly related to climate change -- is 200 million people by 2050. That's about one in every 45 people, given current population estimates. And that figure could rise toward 1 billion as the seas continue to rise and civil unrest takes hold in a destabilized new world. (By way of comparison, multiply today's heartbreaking refugee crisis in Europe and beyond by 200 and you begin to get a sense of the scale of what we're facing with climate change.)We're in this together, us and the walruses. But we're the ones who can make this problem better or worse. I can easily imagine the solid ground that I now stand on disappearing, and being forced onto an unfamiliar shore with thousands like me, disoriented, scared, and facing an uncertain future.I am the walrus -- goo, goo, g'joob.Photo: USGS"}, {"title": "Boy Skips Birthday Gifts, Raises $1,290 For Bullet-Proof Vests For K9 Unit Instead", "text": "This year, Ethan Flint's birthday wish was for more than just him.Instead of gifts for his birthday, the 9-year-old from Minnesota asked for friends and family to donate money to a GoFundMe campaign to help buy protective vests for police dogs, KSTP reported.

The Bureau of Land Management also announced that it is finalizing resource management plans for the West that it says will help protect the greater sage grouse habitat.It might seem like a decision that would please oil, gas and mining interests, which have opposed federal protections for the birds, and members of Congress who have tried to thwart listing the species through the language of budget bills. But many are still not pleased, arguing the federal conservation plans to preserve the birds' habitat is just as detrimental to development as listing it would be. The Western Energy Alliance issued a statement saying it applauds the decision that a listing is not warranted, but that the BLM plans \"persist with top-down, centralized management of sage-grouse on public lands that discourages more effective western efforts.\"House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) called it a \"a cynical ploy\" in a comment to The Hill, arguing that the Obama administration’s \"oppressive land management plan is the same as a listing.\"The congressional opposition to federal protections has also included Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who was looking to protect mining interests in his state.

At least seven other pigs had grotesque rectal prolapses as big as an orange and dripping with blood--and were allowed to suffer from this condition for up to 24 days.A manager lifted up screaming 70-pound pigs by the ears, as well as hitting them with a hard plastic board while loading them for slaughter. On one day when the heat index exceeded 90°F, more than 20 pigs were tightly packed into a metal trailer more than 24 hours before they were hauled to slaughter--just because the manager didn't want to wait another day to pull straw out of a pen. They had no choice but to stand or sit on top of each other for much of that time.As disturbing as this is, it's not a surprise to those of us who have to sit through sickening videos and then listen to the profiteers defend the practices, cover them up and kill the messenger along with the pigs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits and others.Butterball turkeys bear an \"American Humane Certified\" label. PETA filed a Federal Trade Commission complaint after we found out that the American Humane Certified program standards allow farms to cut off turkeys' beaks and toes, deprive them of any natural light or access to the outdoors, shackle them upside-down and dunk them into electric water baths, where they are likely to experience painful shocks. And acts of deliberate, intentional abuse of turkeys, such as kicking and throwing them, do not result in automatic disqualification from the certification process.Reporting on Perdue's recent acquisition of one of the darlings of the \"humane meat\" storyteller crowd, Niman Ranch, journalists have been applying some of the meat industry's favorite buzzwords, such as \"sustainable\" and \"humane.\" Niman is far from either.As Hope Bohanec reported in her exposé of \"humane meat,\" The Ultimate Betrayal: Is There Happy Meat?, even Niman Ranch's former owner and namesake, Bill Niman, stopped eating the company's meat products after shareholders lowered the participating farms' animal-welfare standards. Farms are permitted to shock animals, even \"downed\" ones--those who can't get up because they are too sick, injured or in pain--with electric prods to try to make them move. Workers are allowed to castrate animals and cut off their tails without providing any pain relief. Hens used for eggs can be forced to undergo painful debeaking. And this is all before they even face slaughter, which takes place at a very young age. Of Niman Ranch, Bohanec says, \"[T]here is very little, if any, difference from a standard operation.\" Yet Niman's logo states, \"Raised With Care.\"When we look at the actual company practices behind all the feel-good labels, it's hard not to agree with Bohanec's conclusion: \"[I]t is impossible to produce meat, dairy, or eggs without inherent cruelty. Reducing and eventually abstaining from the use of animal products is the only truly humane option.\"\"Humane meat\" labels are about as trustworthy as a SeaWorld ad. Shoppers are being snowed, and animals are paying the price.Photos: Credit: PETA"}, {"title": "Senate Democrats Stage Major Climate Change Push", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Leading Senate Democrats unveiled climate change legislation on Tuesday that is expected to go nowhere.The point: Present a united party front on the energy and climate debate.Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, authored the bill, which would declare it national U.S. policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2 percent per year.Notably, the bill doesn't attempt to put a price on carbon emissions, which many experts see as a more effective way to mitigate climate change. That omission is arguably an acknowledgement by Democrats that a tax on carbon would diminish the bill's chances of garnering Republican co-sponsors.Asked if the exclusion of such a tax indicates that the bill is a retreat from more realistic goals, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said that \"compared to what Republicans are doing, it's pretty damn good.\"Cantwell too pushed back against the idea that the bill represents a capitulation of some kind. She said she didn't want to pass up any opportunities to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.\"I don't think it's a retreat. Change happens incrementally,\" Cantwell told reporters on Tuesday. \"These are real things that can get implemented now.\"Aside from the 2 percent reduction marker, the bill also offers a long-term performance-based tax incentive program, which Cantwell worked through with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime champion of clean energy tax incentives.Included in the plan are tax credits for clean electricity from renewable to fossil fuel facilities. The cleaner the energy, the bill says, the higher the tax credit. The plan also offers a credit for clean transportation fuel, translated to a production tax credit of up to $1 per gallon.The bill attempts to cover all the bases, including permanently reauthorizing the nation's Land and Water Conservation Fund, investing in energy research and development, modernizing the electric grid and repealing fossil fuel subsidies. It would also stipulate that the U.S. use its leadership to pressure other countries into commitments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.Cantwell said Democrats decided push the bill now to coincide with visits to the U.S. from Pope Francis, who has written an encyclical on the moral obligation to combat climate change, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who recently entered into a deal with the U.S. to curb emissions.But the odds of getting a vote on the Senate floor appear to be nil, as Republicans have widely opposed the Obama administration's climate initiatives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) himself has vowed to work against the president's so-called war on coal to the very end.Pressed on the bill's future, Cantwell said she thinks there is a willingness among Republicans to have the debate. Specifically, she said, she believes an opening will come once the Senate eventually considers a different, all-encompassing energy bill that was voted out of the energy committee earlier this year.\"It was very clear to both sides that once this bill hits the Senate floor, there were going to be ideas on both sides that people were going to propose,\" Cantwell said. \"That's where we think this has an avenue.\"She acknowledged, however, that in the end they will have to see if McConnell decides to give her and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the \"time to talk about energy policy.\"Co-sponsors praised Cantwell for putting forward the bill as Republicans prepare to bring up legislation that would lift a decades-old oil export ban in the coming months. So far, 28 Democrats have signed on to Cantwell's bill, along with Sen. Angus King (I-Maine).Despite the holdups, environmental groups largely cheered the bill, with the Sierra Club calling it a \"bold, ambitious vision.\""}, {"title": "We've Missed the Entire Point About GMO Food -- A Farmer Explains Why", "text": "When it comes to the subject of GMO (Genetically-Modified Organism) food, it's hard not to have an opinion. You might be skeptical or inquisitive, outraged or indifferent; perhaps more often than not, you feel a little of each. Still, there's growing consensus on the issue. A recent poll states that 93 percent of Americans believe that GMO food should be labeled. Consider this statistic a moment: 93 percent of America actually agrees on something. This from a society where 26 percent of respondents still believe the sun orbits around the earth. Based on this new GMO survey, at long last we can finally agree on what's for dinner. Or rather, what's not for dinner. Wait, scratch all that. Maybe we really can't agree on anything.As a 20-year farmer who has raised GMO corn and soybeans for the commodity market, as well as organic, sustainable produce sold at farmers' markets, my two cents is this: Love it or hate it, when it comes to the bigger picture (see 3 \"bigger pictures\" below), it doesn't especially matter. The companies that produce GMO seeds and their affiliate herbicides have already won. And with the food scoreboard reading 96 percent industrialized to 4 percent organic, if this had been a farming football game, the mercy rule would have already been called.The fact is that just a handful of companies provide the corn, soy and canola seeds to America's farmers, amounting to more than 90 percent of market share. What does this mean for consumers? Nine out of every 10 bites of food -- and even higher for chicken (raised on corn and soy), ice-cream (dairy cows supplied corn silage), cheeseburgers (corn) and tortilla chips -- are created with GMO ingredients. The same goes for every sip of soda, processed fruit juices, and most yogurts (corn syrup in each). In fact, we're so jacked up on GMO corn that when a scientist from UC Berkeley created a test -- based on corn's unique carbon patterns -- he determined that 69 percent of the average American's body carbon is derived solely from corn. Insert your own corny joke here.As a young farmer, I witnessed this change in real time. Starting in 1996 (when GMO seeds went mainstream), practically every farm in my area began widespread adoption of GMO seeds. Meanwhile, worldwide, growth in GMO corn, soybeans, canola, rice, etc. grew at a staggering 9,000 percent. For a global economy mired in a deep recession, it appears that GMO seed companies have been doing just fine and dandy.But you didn't have to be a farmer to witness these changes going on. In fact, you didn't even have to do much of anything, other than look out your window... from 35,000 feet. As it turns out, the GMO revolution didn't happen while we were sleeping, or while some consumer watchdog group had its back turned. It happened while we were all flying straight over 'Flyover Country'. To see what I mean, check out these Google Map photos, taken just in advance of grain planting in the spring of 2015:See all those brown squares? Those are fields that have been recently sprayed with herbicide. The straight green lines are fence rows, and little green rectangles and triangles are lawns.Now, let's back out a bit, gaining a little perspective. More killed-off fields, with some green squares remaining in winter cover crops. Those wavy green lines are rivers and watersheds.Finally, here's a view from way up high. Recognize where we are?Zooming out from center, this is Illinois. And Illinois, based on the amount of herbicide that's been sprayed onto her fields, is on life support.See, despite whatever personal opinions you may hold about the safety, health benefits or labeling of GMO foods, one fact remains inarguable: In order for these crops to grow, it requires death on a massive scale. And that's precisely how GMO crops function. The genetic modification creates an immunity to herbicides such as glyphosate (commonly sold under the brand name RoundUp, for example), eliminating competition so the corn/soybean/canola doesn't die when everything else does.And when I say death on a 'massive' scale, I'm talking massive. You can see it from outer space. According to the USDA, this year in America alone, more than 170 million acres of corn and soybeans are in production. At a conservative estimate of 10 gallons of glyphosate (the herbicide most commonly used in conjunction with GMO crops) per acre in dilution, this translates to roughly two billion gallons of herbicide poured onto American soils this year alone. Put another way, we're taking an area the size of California and Montana combined, and killing it dead each year.Most ironically, more than 85% of this GMO corn and soy doesn't even end up as food for humans, at least not directly. 40% is used for ethanol production, and another 45% goes into animal feed. So, let's get this straight: we're killing off hundreds of millions of acres not for human food, but primarily for fuel and feed? That's a real head scratcher right there.The bottom line is this. Instead of worrying about whether a bag of GMO corn chips is safe to eat, we should probably be asking ourselves some bigger questions. Such as, are we okay with using billions of gallons of herbicide each year, supplied by many of the same companies that provide our seeds? And perhaps most importantly, what are the viable alternatives?As Americans, we enjoy nothing so much as a fair fight, healthy competition, and good sportsmanship. Everyone loves a tied ballgame, late in the 4th quarter. But in an agricultural landscape where the score remains locked at 96-4, perhaps it's time we all demanded a more balanced food system. I'd certainly tune in for that."}, {"title": "Pit Bulls In Flower Crowns Result In A Seriously Heart-Tugging Photo Series", "text": "This is Lola. If you saw her on the street -- sans flower crown -- you might wrongfully keep your distance, speed up or avoid eye contact. And yet here, when crowned with a whimsical coronet of candy-colored spring flowers, you probably feel your insides bubbling over with adoration, coupled with the intense desire to grab Lola by her wet, red nose and give her a kiss.Photographer Sophie Gamand, the artist behind \"Flower Power,\" was not originally a fan of pit bulls. However, as a volunteer with animal shelters and rescue groups that frequently encounter the breed (or amalgamation of breeds), she felt the need to dig deeper to discover the roots of her aversion to pit bulls. \"I wanted to understand for myself what the [larger] debate was all about,\" the artist explained to The Huffington Post. \"Were they bloodthirsty monsters? Or just dogs with a bad reputation?\"Through photography, Gamand not only hoped to explore her bias but eventually to unhinge pit bulls from their stereotypically aggressive associations. \"I decided to photograph them in a totally unexpected way, to see if new imagery could challenge the way we perceive them, and ultimately the way we treat them.\"Thus -- the flower crowns.Gamand recruited her photographic subjects from various shelters, showcasing dogs too often abused and neglected in their previous lives. \"I am interested in photographing these contemporary 'monsters' of our society, the rejects, the disposable lives they have become, similarly to [Bartolomé Esteban] Murillo or Egon Schiele,\" she added.Styling her images according to the conventions of traditional baroque portraiture, Gamand captures her subjects facing the camera head on against an ambiguous, sparkly backdrop, positioning them as queen royalty in some alternate dog-driven universe. Additionally, Gamand makes each of the featured flower crowns herself, the ephemeral blossoms symbolizing the fragility of pitbulls' lives.\"In the U.S. alone, between 800,000 and one million pit bulls are euthanized every year,\" Gamand explained. \"I am moved by their fate. I believe that, because we created dogs (through artificial selection) and made them what we wanted them to be, it should give us tremendous responsability towards them. Pit bulls are being quietly massacred.\"Despite her initial hostility toward the pit bull, Gamand is determined to overcome her prejudice and shift the common conceptions of the glorious beasts. \"With this series, I hope to break a cycle by reminding us that pit bulls are precious, fragile, moving creatures. And like any dog, they are what we make of them,\" she concluded.\"The way we treat pit bulls should remind us of our own shortcomings. They hold a mirror up for our humanity. What are they reflecting back at us?\"\"Flower Power\" is on view at Adrien/Kavachnina Contemporary until Oct. 12, 2015.

The confluence of Pope Francis's first visit to the United States and the United Nations' acceptance of 17 Sustainable Development Goals make this week a potential tipping point for our planet.Photo by Cristián Samper ©WCS.On June 18, Pope Francis issued an encyclical on the environment.In it, Francis messages to the Roman Catholic Church's 1.2 billion followers and to all: \"I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.\"He adds: \"Young people demand change. They wonder how anyone can claim to be building a better future without thinking of the environmental crisis and the sufferings of the excluded.\"There are countless appeals from Francis beyond this encyclical advising us all that we have an obligation to be mindful stewards of our planet. Advising that everything in this world is connected. Especially, caring for the environment and caring for the poor.Photo ©Julie Larsen MaherWhen Francis speaks to Congress and the United Nations this week, as he did in Havana recently, this call for all of us to be responsible will no doubt be a part of his message to this country.   And the timing is perfect.  This week, the UN is expected to confirm 17 Sustainable Development Goals, also known as The Global Goals. These goals are our planet's agenda. They are our work plan \"for people, planet and prosperity.\"The 17 goals range from ensuring sustainable use of natural resources, to taking action on wildlife trafficking, to ending hunger and achieving food security.While the Sustainable Development Goals are not solely about conservation, the work of conservationists can play a key role in achieving many of these goals. For example, ending hunger and achieving food security can be tackled by working diligently to conserve terrestrial wildlife and freshwater and coastal fisheries. These resources, if well managed, are essential for food security and can act as insurance to smooth consumption during economic, health, and climatic shocks.Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.Conservation work, while focused on wildlife and the environment, has the effect of protecting the air, water, and land, which are vital for ensuring a healthy environment for all life. The connection between nature and people is as strong a force as gravity.  This link between nature and people is core to the message of Francis and the Sustainable Development Goals.With the United Nations accepting these global goals and with a spokesperson like Francis for our planet, this week could end up being a game changer for Earth -- or as the Pope calls it, \"our common home.\""}, {"title": "Moving Masses", "text": "Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud are the trio who famously disrupted the Western human's sense of place, showing we are not the center of the universe, we are not on the top of some hierarchy of nature, and we are not even very much in control of our thoughts, emotions, or actions. Globalization has continued the trend of total decentralization, and climate change is enveloping us every day in its ubiquity. There is no center of it and there is no escape from it. Perhaps ironically, the imperatives of dealing with climate change mean that even if we are not kings and queens of the universe, we must act as excellent majordomos. Evolutionarily speaking, we are equal to our brethren plants and animals, but we must act as beneficent guardians. We are quite psycho with all our savagery to each other and to the Earth, but we must mobilize our cognitive, emotional, and executive functioning to figure this thing out rationally.Last week my 15-year old son and I did a \"fast raft\" whale watch in Monterey Bay. It was wild! At one point our boat was surrounded by more than two dozen humpbacked whales. There was constant breaching, sometimes two whales leaping up in tandem as if they were doing a star turn in an Esther Williams production. Similarly they frequently \"tailed\" together -- two double-heart shaped tales almost languidly arising up out of the water and then sliding back down into it. The whales are in the midst of a feeding frenzy, gorging on anchovies. Our skipper explained that when the anchovies are swimming in deep waters, the whale action is all diving and rising. Sometimes the fish are closer to the surface and then the sight is of gigantic whale mouths shoveling in shiny slivers of fish. We didn't see any of that, though we got several distinct whiffs of stinky whale breath.Nobody quite knows why the anchovies are massing in such numbers here; they are known to like cold water and ours is warmer than ever right now. Like all whales, humpbacks were hunted to near extinction and today, at 10 percent of their historic population level, their numbers are actually recovering. But the ocean news is overall not good. The World Wildlife Fund recently published dire findings that aqueous species are disappearing at record levels. The loss of any and all of the affected species has major impacts, but big-bodied animals have a special place in the ecosystem.That includes Homo sapiens. People are animals too, and we behave in similar patterns. Elizabeth Hadley and Anthony Barnosky, the Mr. and Mrs. Smith of global change science and coauthors of the forthcoming Tipping Point for Planet Earth: How Close Are We to the Edge? point out that the millions fleeing Syria today are fulfilling a population ecology paradigm.   In sum, when population numbers exceed the capacity of a landscape to provide basic resources for all, species light out for the territory. Writing recently on ConsensusForAction, Hadley and Barnosky point out that too-rapid population growth intensifies competition for resources, which leads to war and eventually migration. Climate change makes matters worse. \"Already, unusual climate events have contributed to the refugee-producing crises in Southeast Asia, northeast Africa, and to the Arab Spring uprising,\" and the poorest, most densely populated regions of the world will be \"hit hardest...as the world tips into a new climate regime.\" Let me just add on a soupcon of grim. Historian Timothy Snyder makes the case in his book Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning that most genocides, including that inflicted by Hitler on Jews, can be traced to conflict over basic resources within a context of shifting global order. He argues that the depredations of climate change are going to reverberate well into what we Westerners take for granted as some kind of wall protecting us from the worst conflicts. Because - it's all one world now.Protecting and increasing the number of big bodied mammals is a critical tool in dealing with all this. Whales sequester carbon in their big bodies and they move it around the ocean through their eating and their pooping. When they die naturally they fall to the bottom of the ocean and their carcasses become habitat hotels to myriad species. The big guys provide for the smaller guys. This is called sustaining biodiversity, and for one thing, it keeps the food supply for Homo sapiens healthy. On land, the solution is essentially habitat protection. Recent research by extinction guru Stuart Pimm and colleague Binbin Li shows that protecting giant pandas in China also protects a host of smaller animals that live within what Pimm and Li call a \"protective umbrella.\" Panda bears happen to live side by side with \"70% of forest bird species, 70% of forest mammals, and 31% of forest amphibian species\" that are endemic to mainland China. That means they are very special species indeed, and keeping the panda protected is a shorthand way to protect its co-travelers. Including, of course, us, because - in the global world, everything that goes around, comes around."}, {"title": "Beloved Elephant Yongki Killed By Poachers For His Ivory In Indonesia", "text": "A beloved endangered Sumatran elephant was found dead Friday with his tusks hacked off at the national park where he lived.Yongki, a 35-year-old elephant who lived at the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, was involved in patrols to protect threatened habitats and calm wild elephants.

The company installed software in its popular Beetle, Jetta, Passat and other models to hide the amount of tailpipe emissions when the cars were getting tested. But when they were on the road, the cars released as much as 40 times the pollution allowed by the Clean Air Act.This shocking way of doing business has revealed an important truth in the fight against climate change: the value of government safeguards and government oversight in protecting public health and reducing dangerous pollution.VW has held a beloved place in American culture. When I graduated from college, many of my friends drove across the country and most hit the road in a VW van or Bug. Through the years, these cars have represented youth, freedom and quirkiness. Now they will also be associated with crookedness.Not only did VW lie to the Environmental Protection Agency, but it also fooled its customers. The company marketed these diesel-powered cars as being environmentally friendly, yet they were pumping out nitrogen oxide, which is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease, increased hospital admissions and premature death. The deceit came to light just days after VW unveiled plans to produce 20 plug-in hybrids and all-electric models by 2020. They framed the announcement as an effort to reduce climate change pollution.How can we trust this company -- or other polluters -- if we don't have a system for verifying what they say?Every single Republican presidential candidate has called for shrinking the government. Many have taken aim at the EPA and the Clean Air Act in particular. Corporations, they say, can be counted on to do the right thing. Jeb Bush has implied that private industry can address climate change through innovation -- no government action required.  The Volkswagen story exposes the limits of this approach.Though many corporations honor commitments to reduce dangerous pollution, some cut corners and cheat. The marketplace doesn't always have mechanisms to correct bad actors. VW drivers, for instance, had no idea their cars were programmed to trick air quality monitors, and so the company paid no price: VW is the largest auto company in the world.Only when government investigators exposed VW's deceit did the stock market respond: the company's shares dropped by 20 percent on Monday. I applaud EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and the EPA staff for doing their job conscientiously and well, despite the constant attacks from Republican leaders in Congress and on the campaign trail.Government safeguards and oversight help ensure companies clean up their act. Thanks to federal and state agencies, Clean Air Act programs cut six common pollutants (including nitrogen oxide) by an average of 72 percent over 40 years, even while GDP grew by 219 percent. In one year alone, clean air standards prevented 205,000 early deaths.We can make similar strides with climate change pollution, but only if companies follow clear standards and government agencies hold them to account. Ten years ago, drivers had just a handful of hybrids to choose from. Then the U.S. established clean car standards to cut carbon pollution from new cars in half, and now consumers have scores of hybrids and other fuel-efficient models to choose from.  The Clean Power Plan has set carbon pollution limits for our nation's other major source of climate change emissions: power plants. The plan gives states a great deal of flexibility in how they achieve carbon reductions but they must meet a firm target and confirm that they are tackling the climate threat.In December, the international community will meet in Paris to finalize a new global agreement for combating climate change. Many companies, cities and other institutions will also pledge to carbon pollution as part of the talks. These commitments could deliver significant carbon reductions -- but only if they include a system for reporting and monitoring progress.Empty promises and intentionally misleading maneuvers leave a bad taste in the mouth: I will never buy a Volkswagen car again. But I have faith in standards wisely implanted. We must trust, but verify."}, {"title": "Should Crimes Against the Environment & Animals Deserve International Prosecution?", "text": "When our global environment is harmed or animals are killed ruthlessly risking extinction and biodiversity, all of humanity is harmed and borders are exposed as irrelevant to global health. Consequently, should crimes against the environment and animals be addressed by an international criminal code and prosecuted by an international tribunal, particularly if national courts are unwilling, unable or deemed inadequate? The killing of \"Cecil the Lion\" by a US hunter was a singular event, perhaps inconsequential except for social media raising it to the level of a diplomatic incident. Nonetheless, the question remains how does the globe deter crimes as poaching, which frequently are not committed as isolated incidents by a rogue dentist from Minnesota but are part of a global criminal enterprise that funds everything from brutal war lords committing sexual violence and child exploitation to terrorism. Poaching and other crimes against our environment also incorporate a far-flung international network. Such crimes against environment and nature are frequently linked and part of the same criminal enterprise(s) that are already codified as \"war crimes\" or \"crimes against humanity,\" as incorporated by the Rome Statute and the International Criminal Court, \"ICC\". Enforcement though may be most inadequate and selective while the impact upon global health and peace may be most profound.Words but how About Deeds & Enforcement?This month the United Nations will host global leaders to seek a paradigm shift, once again, in our collective efforts to manage climate change and other environmental concerns. Even in words global leaders are a day late, or more. Nonetheless, beyond any agreement truly responsive to the problem among member states, what is the depth and breadth of enforcement for violation(s)? Whatever the measure and the rules, beyond the marginal cheating there is also the outright criminal enterprise. Such frequently involve dumping of toxic wastes in states unable, acquiescent and/or complicit due to failed political accountability and selective application of the rule of law. Further, whether toxins, pollutants and/or carbon fuel emissions, the violations even under current law involve multinational enterprises, a rising form of organized crime that undermines and corrupts the efforts agreed to and the institutions/states obliged to enforce. As much as the consequences of environmental crime go beyond borders, so do perpetrators seek to navigate individual states with a sense of impunity.It remains to be seen whether the ICC may be part of the evolution of a solution. As a signatory to the Rome Statute in 1998 and negotiator to the comprehensive international agreement, certain \"grave violations of international humanitarian law\" were clearly within reach and others considered at the time still beyond. We managed to incorporate \"gender based crimes\" when previously sexual assault was seen by some as coincidental and raped women were defined as collateral damage of conflict. In fact, women and more broadly civilians more than not are targets. Genocide is an objective and sexual assault is a weapon. Other crimes as \"aggression\" have taken more time to resolve in extended debate. Terror as an international crime to be addressed by the ICC was in the 1990's a point of debate and remains in global efforts to better define and counter.Global leaders need to envision the evolutionary path forward on catching up with defining the problem, the crimes but also enforcement. The ICC may not be the solution but it could be part of such, at least in terms of better defining standards and countering impunity. The ICC has complementary and not superseding jurisdiction. The ICC is called upon only when national courts are unwilling and/or unable to act. This may be particularly critical if the rule of law is fatally pierced by corruption or politics. Even more so than crimes against one's own citizens or \"crimes against humanity,\" grave violations against our earth impact the whole globe, and humanity. The ICC, or similar institution, to address crimes against environment and animal may not be a clear or straight road forward but it gets us out of the current cul-de-sac.From Jobs and Competitiveness to Nationalism and Tradition Employed as Rationale for Abusing Environment & Animals:The ICC is currently still an institution seeking to gain both the resources and support of global powers in the execution of its mandate. While now around two thirds of the globe's states are members, from all continents, religions and legal cultures, a strange and some might say toxic brew of naysayers remains. This in effect alliance of naysayers includes Iran and Israel, India and Pakistan, the US, Russia and China. Many of the latter also contribute most to climate change and environmental degradation. Many of these states also are domain to the criminal enterprises that prosper from such violations spreading their reach beyond borders. It must though be pointed out that from within the ICC membership, there are also plenty of violators who find refuge. The most frequent argument employed for no enforcement or lax laws is that the other state does it, and if we don't then somehow a competitive advantage or jobs will be lost to the other. Nationalism is also a frequent rallying cry for abusing rather than defending a nation's as well as global natural resources.Protecting Animals, Biodiversity or as Global Citizens:Preserving our biodiversity already has convened global institutions, from NGO's as the World Wildlife Fund, \"WWF,\" to the multilateral UNEP (UN's Environment Program agency based in Nairobi). Already established in 1973, CITES, (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Wild Fauna & Flora), operates to establish standards based on both science and commerce. Such function frequently by consensus and in fact is largely dependent on voluntary application by states and enforcement via the courts and law enforcement of such. Animals, plants and other living subjects that may face endangerment are the subject of protection, or at least some form of oversight. It does not address animals as individuals that may suffer the consequences of exploitation or abuse, as such are not enshrined with any rights as individuals but viewed largely in context of survival of the species.There is a growing number of persons who also perceive the animals killed and made to suffer as global citizens, or at least deserving not only our empathy but protection. (See: \"Are Animals Global Citizens?\") That last question though does not need an answer now, and we can simply start the discourse on the basis of the harm inflicted upon humanity and our shared earth, biodiversity or even notion of \"animal welfare\", (where animals deserve to be treated humanely and not by the higher standards of \"animal rights\"). The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime, \"ICCWC\". brings together key organizations, including Interpol, World Bank, World Customs Organization, UN Office on Drugs and Crime as well as CITES but still largely depends on national efforts - in other words, there is no international tribunal with complementary/supplementary legal jurisdiction to ensure enforcement. (See: CITES)Beyond enforcement, there is also the need to help shape consensus and global attitudes as shared values evolve. The adoption of legal standards by such bodies as the Assembly of State Parties to the ICC is becoming as valid as national or other multilateral institutions when addressing violations of human rights. A revitalized effort on crimes against the environment and animals, in order to be comprehensive and inclusive, may nudge multiple platforms and grassroots sources - is it possible that in a few years we will be speaking of a growing majority not so silent any longer who see animal rights as part of a shared global future? From today's passionate NGO's working on behalf of animals, will we evolve to come to the conclusion that we may need an Ambassador on behalf of Animals at the UN? (See: \"Do Animals Need a UN Ambassador?\")Not About Punishment but Judgment and Projecting an Evolving Responsibility:The killing of \"Cecil the Lion\" awoke the sense of empathy and perhaps responsibility among many by and large hereto silent. Does though the \"poaching\" of a lion rise to the level of crimes as mass-rape or genocide now addressed by the ICC? Is it a \"grave violation of international humanitarian law\"? Perhaps not, but here there is also the most significant gap to address, between growing human consciousness and reality of action. There are also other challenges that deserve consideration: Zimbabwe has requested the Minnesota dentist's extradition for violating poaching laws in killing \"Cecil.\" Although the US State Department has a history of seeking absolute discretion in extradition cases, how comfortable can US Federal Courts be if sending a US citizen to Zimbabwe in view of that state's despotic head of state Robert Mugabe and the risk that an American may be deprived of fundamental legal rights as well as subject to political or other prejudice?The ICC, (or other similar court to be established potentially,) would help insure both proper treatment for the alleged crime as well as the purported perpetrator, (again only in the event national courts were unwilling, unable or otherwise disqualified, again emphasizing that the ICC only has complementary jurisdiction.) Further, the standards for prosecution and defense would reflect an evolving international consensus, perhaps best addressing a crime by a US citizen, committed in Zimbabwe, of the killing of an African lion who is perceived by many global citizens of deserving our empathy and protection.Will We be the Survivors or the Fossils?  The crime of poaching a single lion may appear to be inconsequential compared to the suffering inflicted upon humans from Myanmar to Syria to the Horn of Africa. However, the idea is not punishment of perpetrators. For the crimes of genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda, the death penalty was neither the aim nor consequence. Rather judgment was needed to move forward with peace as much as to convict - just because impunity prevailed in the past, it should not shape the future. International tribunals help present diverse views not only into action/enforcement but also bring legal shape to changing attitudes. Punishment of poachers and others involved in the economic perpetration of such crimes may not result in harsh sentences but the more important consequence is deflating impunity and giving form to accountability. It may not only interdict crimes against nature but also confront those committing grave violations against fellow humans. I want to avoid being presumptuous by offering all the answers, but it is evident that many around the globe are increasingly asking the question and offering fresh perspectives reflecting evolving science, views of animals and our responsibility toward them. Animal rights are not human rights but our respect for one enhances the other. (See more on the efforts from writings of social media friend, Stevan Zivkov Andricin, an animal rights activist and his group, \"Animals: A Parallel History Coalition.\")Whether the crime is inflicted upon our environment and/or animals, we begin to perceive in new perspectives. The impact is increasingly understood as global, as is the responsibility. Our survival is linked as the earth is waterhole for all, and borders between nations but also species become less of guarantee for prosperity or even survival. For those who cling to sovereignty, tradition or individual options as the only relevant consideration, like the dinosaurs, their dominion is already being overshadowed by a paradigm change in both necessity and attitudes. That does not mean that they should be ignored in the discussion, but the choice is to voice today's challenges or have our fossils tell of our ignorance of the pending risks. In combating terror, the threat is perceived to warrant a change. Calls for a more coordinated international response and where borders are increasingly defined by the nature of the crime as well as response. Similarly, when addressing an existential threat to earth and life, change is upon us, and we can guide it or all be swept away by something that strikes with the power of a cosmic event.By: Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey, @MuhamedSacirbeyWith Contribution from Stevan Zivkov & Susan Sacirbey   UN Photo One/E Darroch: Drought in Africa, Jan. 1984, Botswana, \"Drought is ravaging the continent of Africa.

That's led to a persistent dependence on fossil fuels and all the costs, damage and risk they bring.It means that our families, communities and economy have been held hostage to the fuels that pollute our environment and our politics.That has kept us from seizing our energy destiny, and moving toward a clean energy future--one that boosts our economy, creates good-paying clean energy jobs, saves people money on their electric bills and curbs the dangerous carbon pollution that drives climate change.The Democratic energy bill offers many tools to seize that destiny.First, putting climate at the forefront, the measure unveiled by Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington and allies establishes a national carbon reduction goal of 2 percent annually through 2025.Next, fossil fuel subsidies, which have encouraged dependence, are zeroed out, while new tax incentives for clean energy are tucked in.Those incentives will foster further development of wind and solar power, helping us get more energy from renewable sources. Energy efficiency incentives, promoted in the bill, will enable us to use energy more wisely and at a lower cost when we flip on the light switch.Taken together, the bill's impact on our families, economy and climate would be measurably positive. Americans would save $40 billion in energy costs over the next 15 years. We'd see creation or support of 3.5 million jobs. And climate pollution could drop by 34 percent in 2025.Finally, a critical element of this national energy vision recognizes our obligation to protect our children and future generations from the ravages of climate change.It complements the work of the Environmental Protection Agency's landmark Clean Power Plan by providing the tools utilities and states need to meet the plan's carbon reduction goals and support from Congress to put our country on the right trajectory to invest in clean and energy-efficient technologies.That's an energy destiny we want to reach.We must take many steps--led by setting the first limits on power plant carbon, the largest source of climate pollution in the U.S. and around the world--and we must take them now, for a reason.Climate change is not a far-off phenomenon. It's here. There's a 97 percent chance that 2015 will be the hottest year on record since 1880, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced. Already, 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred this century.To stick with fossil fuels of our past, and not chart a path toward a cleaner future, would doom our children and future generations to more withering heat, rising seas, punishing storms, blazing wildfires and widening deserts.We can't forsake them to that future.The vision of many Republicans would do so. It will lead us to a dirty energy future and would have very real and very negative consequences for our health and livelihood.The climate inaction agenda is to keep up--even double down on--our habits of the last two centuries despite the fact that we now know them to be destructive. And the Republican leadership excuse of supposed inaction internationally is a non-starter when we see China with double the solar energy of the United States and a strong commitment to reduce its carbon pollution.It's notable, for example, that through a GOP measure known as the OPENS Act, the floodgates would open on offshore oil drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic Ocean, and the ban on exporting U.S. crude oil would be removed. That would lock us into dependence on fossil fuels for decades.Ask yourself: Is this a forward-leaning energy vision? No. It's the opposite: A backward-looking one keeping us tied to fossil fuels of the past.That's why the Democratic energy proposal contains so many important actions. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Cutting carbon pollution. Powering our cities from the wind and sun. Making our cars and trucks go farther on less fuel. Wasting less energy from our buildings and appliances.That's how we'll clean up our air, create clean energy technologies and provide jobs for workers and companies in the 21 Century economy.And that's how we'll demonstrate America's greatness--by exercising leadership showing the world that together, with everyone doing their part, we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change."}, {"title": "Saddening Note Left With Abandoned Kittens", "text": "It's hard to imagine how anyone could abandon an adorable litter of kittens in a suitcase on the street — but that's exactly what someone did last week in Warrington, U.K. And whoever did it even left a note."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Preserving Biodiversity, Solar Origami, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.Froggy Ice Pop?

Studies show that coastal dwellers live healthier lives, and a new study suggests that those who make a habit of walking by the ocean average almost an hour of extra sleep compared to those who don't.\"It’s clear there is something really special about the coast that can allow people to boost their mood, relax and sleep,\" said Eleanor Ratcliffe, a psychologist who conducted the study for the United Kingdom's National Trust. To test the powers of a beach stroll, about 100 adults, many of whom identified as walkers, walked an average of seven miles each on a single day. Half of the participants walked on coastal paths in places like Dorset and Wales, while he other half took their strolls inland, walking by parks and woods.The participants who walked by water slept an average of 47 minutes longer than the group who stuck to land. In addition, these walkers experienced an increased sense of alertness in the morning.The researchers didn't examine  why coastal strollers were able to get more R&R by the seaside, though they speculated that it could merely be an association between beach and vacation.\"Given relationships between restorative environments and a sense of escape or ‘being away’ from daily life, it may be that coastal walkers felt more able to relax and let go in these environments due to their associations with holidays, with potential effects on sleep length,\" Ratcliffe said.The great news is that both inland and shore strollers reported feeling happier, calmer and better-rested the morning after their walks, compared to mornings when they didn't move as much.Previous research has linked walking -- especially walking outdoors -- with a good night's sleep as well as better moods and better health. So even if you can't get to the beach any time soon, don't let it deter you from lacing up your trainers and taking a long, sleep-improving jaunt.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Are Companies Keeping Their Climate Pledges?

On Wednesday, at Climate Week NYC, we get to learn how they are progressing one year on.By Steve Zwick. Re-posted from Ecosystem Marketplace22 September 2015 | NEW YORK | Climate Week NYC kicked off here yesterday and runs through September 28, with more than 150 events scattered across the city and a Friday visit from Pope Francis. You can bet that companies will step up with promises to save the planet, as 53 of them did last year when they endorsed the New York Declaration on Forests, but how do you know which promises are being kept, and which are just words?If you're in New York, you'll get two chances for at least some answers this week, as Forest Trends' Supply Change project offers findings from its analysis of companies that endorsed the Declaration (a text of which is available here). The Supply Change findings will be released on Wednesday at 8 a.m., in a report entitled \"Firm Commitments: Tracking Company Endorsers of the New York Declaration on Forests\", and the release will be followed by two events offering a deeper dive into the implications.The first event takes place on Wednesday, from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at the offices of Hunton and Williams (200 Park Avenue, #53) and is entitled The New York Declaration on Forests: One Year of Business Progress and the Pathway to Paris. Key business and civil-society actors on deforestation will discuss the progress made to date and the role of corporate leadership and collective action as well as the potential for forests to feature at the heart of a strong climate agreement at year-end climate talks in Paris - and what must to be done to turn this potential into reality.The second event takes place a day later, on Thursday, from 10am to 12noon, at the Rainforest Alliance Headquarters (233 Broadway), and is entitled Report Launch - Firm Commitments: Tracking Company Endorsers of the New York Declaration on Forests. Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace will present detailed findings from the report with discussions from other topic experts on these and other implications of the Declaration to advance transparency in the implementation of deforestation-free commitments.Supply-Change.org tracks nearly 300 companies that have made commitments to reduce deforestation from their supply chains, and the New York Declaration on Forests includes commitments from 53 corporations - as well as 37 national governments, 20 sub-national (state) governments, 16 indigenous organizations, and 54 environmental groups (including Ecosystem Marketplace publisher Forest Trends). The endorsers set a goal to halve deforestation by 2020 and to eliminate all deforestation by the year 2030. Commercial agriculture is particularly key since is drives at least 70% of tropical deforestation, with production of soy, palm oil, timber and pulp, and cattle being the \"big four\" commodities.\"Firm Commitments\" looks at who the 53 company endorsers of the Declaration are and then focuses in on the performance of 41 companies - primarily name-brand food retailers and manufacturers based in developed countries - which have been profiled on Supply-Change.org. The report examines what concrete steps they're taking towards fulfilling their pledges and how they compare to companies that haven't endorsed the Declaration.We also look to see which of the \"big four\" commodities are getting greener, and which aren't. Then we assess the correlation between sustainability and other practices, such as support for human rights, peatland protection, and transparency in supply chains.The sessions are open to the public, and the report will be available for download on Wednesday at 8 a.m. Eastern time at http://forest-trends.org/releases/p/firm-commitments."}, {"title": "Saddening Note Left With Abandoned Kittens", "text": "It's hard to imagine how anyone could abandon an adorable litter of kittens in a suitcase on the street — but that's exactly what someone did last week in Warrington, U.K. And whoever did it even left a note."}, {"title": "Undercover Investigation Reveals Shocking Animal Cruelty and Safety Violations at Tyson Foods Slaughterhouse", "text": "Undercover footage released by the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) documents Tyson Foods, Inc.

It was by far the hardest thing I've physically ever had to do.\"Industry meets agricultureMost of us are familiar with old black-and-white images of Henry Ford's assembly line. The assembly line revolutionized manufacturing, allowing increased efficiency and profits.Used in modern agribusiness, the assembly line essentially becomes an industrialized animal disassembly line, providing a mechanistic end to the short, miserable lives of billions of animals every year. In fact, over 10 billion land animals die annually in U.S. factory farms; an overwhelming majority of them are chickens.Animal welfare at Tyson processing plants around the U.S. has been the target of many questions in recent years. Most recently, in July, the animal welfare organization Mercy For Animals released undercover footage showing horrific conditions at a chicken farm that contracts with Tyson. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has also documented numerous animal welfare issues at Tyson facilities.ALDF takes actionAs a result of its investigation, ALDF has filed formal complaints against Tyson Foods with three federal agencies:First, ALDF filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), concerning Tyson's inhumane animal handling practices and food safety violations. ALDF is asking the agency to enforce basic food safety regulations outlined in the Poultry Products Inspection Act.Second, ALDF filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), citing unsafe working conditions for employees, including repetitive motion stress injuries and the high risk of maiming by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. The pressure to process thirty-five chickens per minute eight hours a day forces workers to put their quotas ahead of animal welfare, food safety regulations, and their own personal safety.Third, ALDF filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing Tyson Foods of overstating the priority it puts on animal welfare in corporate and investor materials. The complaint contends that Tyson Foods is well aware of the working conditions in its plants, as well as of blatant violations of welfare regulations covering poultry processing.The assembly line model may work well for inanimate objects like cars and computers, but fails animals and workers alike. ALDF hopes to bring Tyson Foods to justice, so the company will improve animal welfare and worker safety in this Texas plant and all its facilities."}, {"title": "Activists Hope Pope Can Change Climate Conversation In Washington", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Climate activists are hopeful that Pope Francis will be able to bring a message to policymakers this week that has so far not permeated the nation's capital: that climate change is as much a moral consideration as it is a scientific, economic and political challenge.The moral impetus for action is at the center of the pontiff's \"Laudato Si,\" the encyclical on the environment he released in June imploring Catholics take on a \"renewed sensitivity to the rights of others\" and a \"greater concern for nature and the poor.\"The pope concludes the encyclical with two prayers, the first asking \"that we may protect the world and not prey on it, that we may sow beauty, not pollution and destruction.\"Lawmakers have heard -- and remained impervious to -- repeated messages on the overwhelming science demonstrating the human influence on climate change and the economic consequences of failing to do anything about it. But the pope is expected to bring a message sorely needed in D.C. when he address Congress on Thursday, putting climate into a social justice context.\"The biggest thing he adds politically is he makes this a bread-and-butter issue,\" Christopher Hale, executive director ​of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, told The Huffington Post. \"A lot of times environmental issues are seen as elitist. He's saying this is not an elitist issue. He's saying this is an issue that affects human lives and the poor.\"\"Saying climate change has a disproportionate effect on the poor is a message that has not gotten out widely, and secular environmental groups have not done a good job getting out this message,\" he continued. \"I think what he adds to this equation is a particular and poignant message that resonates with everyday Americans. … It does not come off as nearly as elitist.\"There's already some evidence that the pope's message is getting through to Congress. Last week, a group of 11 House members, led by Catholic Rep. Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.), signed on to a resolution pledging to work \"constructively\" on solutions to climate change. The resolution notes that \"if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans, hitting vulnerable populations hardest.\"While the number of Republicans who have signed on to the House effort is small, there's hope that the pope's message will prompt other legislators to at least stand down on their efforts to thwart U.S. participation in the global climate agreement or the nation's work to help poor countries deal with climate change.\"There's nobody better to deliver the moral argument than the pope,\" said Karen Orenstein, senior international policy analyst at Friends of the Earth. \"That will be un-ignorable. Congress will have to hear it.\"Christina Leano, the global campaigns coordinator of Global Catholic Climate Movement, said the release of the encyclical this year, as leaders prepare for climate talks in Paris, is not a coincidence.\"I think we have a very smart pope that knows timing is important,\" said Leano, whose group recently launched Pray for COP21, a three-month-long prayer chain organized online to coordinate prayer among Catholics worldwide for a good outcome at the December climate discussions. \"He's creating the space in the public sphere to really shape the dialogue on climate change being not just about science, but about morality, about faith.\"Hale also thinks the pope's visit will shift the tone among Republican presidential candidates, giving them \"space to act more prudently.\"\"Whether or not politicians agree with Pope Francis, they're no longer in a space where they can ignore him,\" he said. There's already been some shifting in rhetoric from the candidates, with formerly skeptical Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) signaling that he would not challenge the pope on climate. The pope, \"as a moral authority is reminding us of our obligation to be good caretakers of the planet,\" Rubio said. Fellow Catholic Jeb Bush said he doesn't take economic policy advice from the pope, but would consider what the pope has to say \"as it relates to climate change and how that connects to these broader, deeper issues.\"While the moral argument for climate action might be new to many in the U.S., a religious movement for climate action has been underway in the nation for years. The movement includes groups like Interfaith Power & Light, which was founded 15 years ago to help churches and other religious institutions become \"faithful stewards of Creation.\" So far, they have engaged 18,000 congregations in 40 states. \"Our message is so similar to what the pope is saying,\" said Rev. Sally Bingham, an Episcopal priest and the group's founder. But the difference, she said, is \"we're not popes -- we don't have the influence.\"There are still a lot of people, including many of the 76.7 million Catholics in the U.S., for whom the pope's message is novel. A poll following the delivery of the pope's encyclical found that fewer than half of American Catholics knew about it. But his visit to the U.S., which includes stops in three cities and widespread media coverage, is expected to change that.\"I think the pope's message will push it further down the road, and much more quickly than we would have done without him,\" she said. \"I think he's calling not just Americans and not just Roman Catholics to a conversion in the way we think, the way we live in the world -- that we have to stop thinking about ourselves alone and start thinking about other people.\""}, {"title": "Reducing Climate Injustice to the Poor Is Within Our Reach", "text": "Authored by V. Ramanathan & Durwood Zaelke  In his encyclical, Laudato Si, Pope Francis describes the immorality of a society based on over-consumption, which takes from the earth more than can be sustained, and chokes our land and our oceans and our atmosphere with waste. The Pope describes the injustice of the \"economy of exclusion,\" where the poor are increasingly isolated on the margins of society, and urges us to \"integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.\" But the biggest injustice and loudest cry of the poor will come from the failure to reduce climate impacts immediately, when we have the means to do so at our disposal.   The Pope receives advice on environmental science through the Pontifical Academy of Science, where a third of its eighty members are Nobel Laureates. He also receives advice on economics and environmental justice from the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences consisting of world-renowned scholars. The two academies met in 2014 and one of us (VR) presented our findings in person to Pope Francis. We informed him that about 60 percent of the warming pollutants are due to the top consuming one billion people, while the poorest three billion people contribute only about 5 percent, yet they will suffer the worst consequences of climate disruption.Most of the poorest three billion are subsistent farmers depending on crops from small plots and cannot survive the mega-droughts and fires ravaging California now. Many will be forced to migrate to already crowded slums and suffer the consequences of modern forms of slavery. We can already see the injustice of more frequent and extreme heat waves, droughts, record storms, and rising sea levels. We can also see warming that is triggering feedback mechanisms, where today's warming causes still more warming. The loss of the reflective sea-ice in the Arctic is one such feedback--where incoming heat that was once reflected back into space is now absorbed in the darker ice-free ocean. Drought fueled forest fires are another. The most insidious is the warming leading to an increase in humidity since water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas. The increased humidity recorded all over the planet is already adding fuel to the deadly storms and floods.Re-orienting society towards a sustainable path is a long-term quest. In the meantime, we need fast-action strategies to reduce the risk of passing tipping points that will set off potentially irreversible planetary scale changes. Our immediate goal must be to take fast action today to reduce near-term climate impacts, as we reform our energy system as fast as we can to reduce carbon dioxide, the potent greenhouse gas emitted by fossil fuel combustion.Fortunately, there are fast climate mitigation options. These start with strategies to reduce the short-lived climate pollutants, which may be the only way to reduce impacts within the next several decades. The short-lived climate pollutants, which are contributing as much as 40 percent to the current warming rate, include methane gas from the organic waste we put into our landfills along with other waste from our consumer society, black carbon particles from dirty diesels, open burning of crop residues and primitive cooking, tropospheric ozone (the main component of urban smog), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) coolants found in refrigerators and air conditioners. The science of these non-carbon dioxide warming pollutants has been known since 1975.Because short-lived climate pollutants have a brief life span of days to about fifteen years, their mitigation benefits will be felt within days to a decade of implementation. We have calculated that reducing short-lived climate pollutants can cut the rate of projected global warming by half by mid-century. It can also slow the rate of sea-level rise by nearly a third. Of course we must cut both the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and the short-lived climate pollutants as fast as we can.Since methane, black carbon, and ozone are not necessary by-products of fossil fuel combustion, they can be eliminated without any negative impact on development of the poor or the rich. Cutting these pollutants will disproportionately benefit the poor, since it will save millions of lives lost to indoor and outdoor air pollution every year. It will also avoid the loss of tens of million tons of crops grown by the poorest three billion, which are destroyed by ozone pollution. We also need to cut HFCs, the fastest growing greenhouse gas in much of the world. This can avoid the equivalent of 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. While these actions will promote intra-generational equity towards today's generations, we must reduce fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions drastically to fulfill our obligations towards generations unborn, since the climate effects of carbon dioxide linger for millennia.Justice delayed is too often justice denied, and this will be the case for the poor, who need fast mitigation to avoid the sort of catastrophic climate injustices they will soon suffer. The moral case for fast action is all the more compelling when one realizes that we have the means at hand to drastically bend the temperature curve back to a safe level. The health benefits alone will more than offset the cost of mitigation. Whether compelled by the Vatican's call to help those suffering the impact of climate change now, or worried whether our \"common home\" will still be around for our grandchildren and generations unborn to enjoy, it's not too late for all of us to start promoting climate justice today. We have the choice and the resources to act now.V.

According to New Scientist, after shining a light on a southern sand octopus, the frightened specimen began to shoot jets of water into the sand below, creating a pit of quicksand into which it buried its entire body.According to recently published research, this is the first time a cephalopod has been observed forming a complete burrow beneath the sand.\"It actually was a pocket – like a space that the octopus could sit within,\" Jasper Montana of the University of Melbourne told New Scientist. \"So it was a true burrow.\"While it sounds simple in theory, the process of creating the burrow is quite complex, requiring the octopus to use its arms to create a \"chimney\" to breathe through and solidify the walls of the chamber with a layer of mucus.Or, as the scientists simply put it, \"advanced sand-fluidisation and adhesive mucus for sediment manipulation.\"This subterranean burrowing is thought to be another form of protection from predators, especially since the southern sand octopus is lacking the camouflage abilities other octopuses have.\"This is another amazing example of how octopuses continue to surprise us with their intelligence -- and ingenuity,\" Katherine Harmon Courage, author of the book Octopus!

Fifteen years ago, the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ignored the importance of the ocean for sustainable development, apart from a small reference to sustainable fishing and marine protected areas. Yet the global ocean, which covers nearly three-quarters of the surface of our planet and plays a central role for all terrestrial life, is on a severe trajectory of decline, as shown last year in the Global Ocean Commission's report, 'From Decline to Recovery: A Rescue Package for the Global Ocean.'The international community is becoming increasingly aware that, no matter where we live, every second breath of air we take is provided by the ocean, while billions of people are directly dependent on the food and protein it produces. Indeed, without a healthy and resilient ocean, it would be hard to achieve other agreed Sustainable Development Goals, such as food security and improving nutrition (SDG 2), reducing inequality (SDG 10), sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) and combatting climate change and its impacts (SDG 13).In 2012, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development or Rio+20, there were signs that the ocean was gaining prominence on the sustainable development agenda. With 20 paragraphs, the 'Ocean and Seas' section was the largest substantive section of the Rio+20 final declaration, 'The Future We Want.'The stand-alone \"Ocean SDG\" was initially proposed by the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) in late 2013 and early 2014 when the Open Working Group on the SDGs began its work.SDG 14, \"Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development,\" contains seven targets designed to reaffirm the commitment of the international community to addressing issues identified as key to the future of the ocean. These come under several issues: marine pollution (including the impacts from CO2 concentrations) (Targets 14.1 and 14.3); ecosystem protection and resilience (Targets 14.2 and 14.5); fisheries conservation (Targets 14.4 and 14.6); as well as economic opportunities for those most vulnerable (Target 14.7).As means of implementation, SDG 14 recognizes increased scientific knowledge and research capacity as well as the transfer of marine technology, access to resources for small-scale artisanal fishers, and international law as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).Veterans of the ocean conservation community may say that the majority of these targets sound familiar, almost like a broken record. Indeed, Target 14.5 on marine protected areas echoes commitments made as long ago as 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa and again more recently in Nagoya, Japan under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010 (Aichi Target 11). Harmful fishing subsidies (Target 14.6) have been discussed ad nauseam within countless international fora, including the World Trade Organization (WTO). And countries have already entered into legally-binding commitments to reduce, prevent and abate marine pollution (Target 14.1) under several global and regional agreements, some dating back to the 1970s.So, how can SDG 14 be a milestone?Until now, the ocean has remained marginalized in a silo for many years and has not received the attention it deserves. SDG 14 can give the ocean the visibility it needs. With SDG 14, governments and civil society can build together a focused Ocean Movement that brings ocean recovery into the heart of sustainable development.SDG 14 will increase accountability, especially if -- as a group of influential countries are working towards -- a series of UN Ocean conferences are held every three years (from 2017 to 2029) to monitor and review how well SDG 14 is implemented. The ocean is missing its accountability moment; a time when the international community as a whole unites, sees what we are doing to the ocean and steers action. Regardless of its flaws and limitations, if there had not been such an accountability moment for the climate, political momentum in the last 20 years and the resulting action would have been almost non-existent. This is what the ocean needs and what SDG 14 and the proposed triennial UN Ocean conferences can offer. ------------------------------------------- Twitter: @GOceanC & @RemiParmentierGlobal Ocean Commission: www.globaloceancommission.orgThis was first published on http://sd.iisd.org/guest-articles/sdg-at-sea/"}, {"title": "Animal Shelter Asks For Help After Its Dogs Are Apparently Forced To Fight", "text": "A rural Tennessee animal shelter is raising money to pay for security cameras after someone apparently broke in and forced two dogs to fight.Volunteers arrived at the Best Friends Sanctuary in Jamestown, Tennessee, on Sept. 11 to find two dogs, Sam and Bucky, covered in blood and locked together in a cage.“They look in your eyes, and he’s still breathing, but [there's] blood everywhere,” the shelter's president, Sharon Cravens, told local TV station WATE.Shelter employees believe someone climbed over the facility's barbed wire fence, unlocked Sam's cage and pushed Sam into Bucky's enclosure.Brenda Goett, the shelter's treasurer, told The Huffington Post she thinks the dogs may have also been drugged.\"There was vomit in the cages,\" she said. \"Their eyes were dilated.\"Bucky was so badly injured that he had to be euthanized.The Jamestown Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Now, a week and a half later, Sam is recovering.

Hugh Carey approved a deal with General Electric exonerating the company from responsibility under New York State law for cleaning up the toxic mess it had created by dumping PCBs in the Hudson River over a 40-year span. Under pressure from GE, which threatened to pull jobs out of the state, Carey let the company off the hook for a paltry $3 million in research funds. Apparently not big on science-based decision-making, Carey dismissed the risks of PCBs, saying he wouldn't mind drinking a glass of the chemical.Carey's successor, Mario Cuomo, took a different tack, calling on the federal government to use its authority to get GE to clean up the health-threatening contaminants. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared a 200-mile stretch of the Hudson a Superfund site in 1983, GE persuaded the agency to adopt a \"No Action\" strategy regarding removal of polluted river sediments. Armed with data from advances made in quantifying the harm PCBs cause humans and wildlife, Gov. Cuomo successfully petitioned the EPA to revisit this decision, laying the groundwork for its eventual order for GE to undertake a cleanup. Unfortunately, GE used its lobbying clout with the EPA to limit the resulting cleanup (authorized in 2002) to less than 65 percent of the contaminants.With the long-term health of the Hudson now hanging in the balance, which of these men will New York's current governor, Andrew Cuomo, choose as his role model?As GE nears completion of the EPA-mandated portion of the project, it has begun dismantling its massive cleanup infrastructure--despite the additional dredging still needed to achieve the goals set by the EPA, much less a healthy river. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation and two federal agencies charged by law to serve as \"trustees\" of the Hudson's natural resources damaged by GE's contamination have publicly stated that the EPA cleanup is inadequate. To restore fuller public use and enjoyment of the river--as well as to make its fish safe to eat--it could take as little as two additional seasons of dredging. Without it, the Hudson's recovery will be delayed for generations.At the same time, we've learned that GE scientists systematically under-reported PCBs in fish, a key measure of the current cleanup's effectiveness. Their incorrect testing methods indicate toxicity levels significantly lower than actual, increasing the risks to people all along the river, especially those who catch fish for subsistence despite health warnings. EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck has rushed to defend the integrity of GE's cleanup, despite this breach of protocol, while failing to rebut the company's patently false claims that it has no further responsibility for addressing the damage its chemicals have caused the Hudson.Under Superfund rules, GE remains legally and financially responsible for restoring the river's health. While the trustees have not disclosed the dollar value of the liability, it's likely in the billions of dollars. Unfortunately, neither New York State nor the federal trustees have taken action to compel GE to undertake a comprehensive cleanup, nor have they asked the EPA to halt the company from decommissioning its cleanup operation. Regional Administrator Enck has indicated she's waiting to hear from the trustees before taking any action to halt GE's premature dismantling of this infrastructure.Gov. Andrew Cuomo unquestionably has the authority as a federally designated natural resource trustee to ask Enck to prevent GE from decommissioning the cleanup facilities. He also has the authority to take action against GE for failing to clean up the Champlain Canal, once a vibrant commercial shipping channel now choked with PCBs and too shallow to accommodate deep-draft vessels.But with a decision imminent on the fate of the river's future, GE has made a show of interest in possibly moving its headquarters back to New York. Could this be a coincidence, or is the company up to its old tricks, playing the jobs-versus-environment card that led Gov. Carey to let GE off the hook four decades ago?But cleaning up the Hudson is a job engine. It provides direct employment for an estimated 500 workers and engages approximately 200 companies in the region. Furthermore, a complete cleanup promises a brighter economic future for communities all along the Hudson, especially those upriver hoping to proceed with long-delayed waterfront revitalization plans. And dredging the Champlain Canal would allow the resumption of cargo shipping on this vital link between New York Harbor and the Great Lakes.Mario Cuomo once said, \"I talk and talk and talk, and I haven't taught people in 50 years what my father taught me by example in one week.\"Let's hope Andrew looks to his father's courageous example by rejecting GE's cynical tactics, immediately calling on the EPA to stop the company from dismantling its facilities, and using his authority and persuasive powers as governor to require the company to reach the goal the elder Cuomo hoped for--a clean, healthy Hudson."}, {"title": "The Biggest Mistake Pet Owners Make at the End", "text": "If I had a big huge red pen and could permanently strike five words from the Standard Veterinary Dialogue, it would be this: \"You'll know when it's time.\"Waiting for The LookWouldn't that be great, if pets had a little button that popped up like a Butterball turkey when they were ready to be euthanized? It would eliminate a lot of agonizing on the part of loving pet owners who are struggling with one of the most significant decisions they will have to make in a pet's life. But that's rarely how it actually works.Perhaps you've heard people talk about \"The Look,\" the appearance a pet has when he or she is ready to depart this Earth. \"You'll know it when you see it,\" they say, and they are right. It's hard to describe, that sort of intuitive emotional bond that develops between owner and pet when they are signaling that they are done. I've seen it and I agree, it's hard to miss. It provides a great deal of reassurance to pet owners to know that their pet seems in agreement that it's time for the next adventure.The only problem is, this doesn't always happen.Pets have other ways of communicating with us beside a meaningful gaze that speaks to our soul; namely, their behavior. Veterinarians experienced in end-of-life care work with very specific quality of life assessments that can give more subjective endpoints than simply \"a look,\" which can be key when an owner is waiting for a sign that may not come and ignoring all the other cues that a pet is communicating.The Quality of Life AssessmentAppetite, mobility, hydration, pain, interest in their surroundings, and hygiene are all very specific categories we can assess to determine a pet's quality of life. Think of it less as a \"yes/no\" switch that gets flipped and more like a spectrum as a pet approaches death. There's a large grey zone towards the end where owners could make a good argument for or against it being \"time\", and that is the agony and the burden we face as pet owners.I like the quality of life assessment that uses multiple variables to assess a pet's condition because all too often, people focus on one specific thing. \"Radar hasn't gotten up for a week,\" an owner will say. \"He cries all night, soils himself, and pants constantly, but he ate a piece of hot dog yesterday and wagged his tail once, so I don't think it's time yet.\" In these cases, I counsel owners that we don't need to wait until every moment of a pet's waking hours are miserable before making the decision to euthanize.It's ok to go out on a bit of a high note. It is one of the blessings of euthanasia, that we can say goodbye in a controlled, peaceful environment and eliminate the pain and stress of a crisis moment at the end.Death used to be as mysterious for me as it is for most people, but after years working with pets Death and I have become, if not friends, at least very collegial. With that under my belt, the only thing I can tell you with certainty is this: The only way you'll know that it's time, truly and without doubt, is when the pet actually stops breathing. Everything else is open to interpretation.Rarely do people tell me after the fact that they let a pet go too soon. If anything, most feel they waited too long. We have a saying in our field that I repeat on a daily basis to my clients: \"It's better to be a week too early than a minute too late.\""}, {"title": "Climate Change Could Cost The World Trillions More Than We Thought", "text": "The gross domestic product of the United States was nearly $17.5 trillion in 2014. That's enough money to buy all the planet's gold two times over.Now consider this: If the world's permafrost thaws, as a new study warns, humanity could be saddled with a bill that adds more than $43 trillion to the already massive climate-related debt the world will rack up in the next two centuries.$43,000,000,000,000.You can do the math yourself, but that's more than two-and-a-half times America's GDP and an economic death sentence \"beyond conception,\" says Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center and one of the authors of the report.The report, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, looks at a previously underexamined contributor to global climate change: the permafrost, or the region of permanently frozen ground that occurs in the world's coldest places.Schaefer and co-author Chris Hope, a public policy expert at the University of Cambridge, find that unchecked global warming could thaw this band of ground and cause 10,000 years' worth of trapped organic matter to decompose. This decomposition could easily double the amount of greenhouse gases currently in the atmosphere, Schaefer said.\"This frozen carbon is like broccoli in your freezer: If you thaw it out and put it in your fridge it'll eventually decay and go bad,\" he said.That decay and the resulting methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will exacerbate climate change at a cost of $43 trillion by 2200, the authors estimate. The costs associated with climate change range from the relatively small, such as the additional expense of more air conditioning, to the much more dramatic, like the loss of agricultural crops to drought and the destruction of cities from rising sea levels.Schaefer and Hope estimate that without the permafrost thaw, the cost of climate change will be $326 trillion by 2200. The extra $43 trillion would constitute a 13 percent increase -- a substantial amount, especially given that no one really considered the frozen ground as a carbon sink until about 10 years ago.\"There is almost nothing in the literature on this,” Hope told The Washington Post.But all is not lost. Schaefer pointed to his co-author's area of expertise, public policy, and said policy change could still spur humans to slow down climate change to the best of their ability.In December, hundreds of foreign leaders and scientists will convene in Paris for the U.N. climate summit and attempt to hash out a global strategy to address rising seas, warming temperatures and the unchecked release of greenhouse gases around the globe. Many worry the talks may be the \"last chance\" for action if the planet is to remain below the agreed-upon warming ceiling of 2 degrees Celsius.The latest research on permafrost adds to a growing slate of troubling headlines, including the warmest summer on record and the potential for massive sea level rise. But Schaefer says there's still time, should we choose to act.\"Let's be clear, the longer we wait, the harder it's going to be,\" he said. \"It's like a gigantic, slow-moving ocean liner that you're trying to steer with a canoe paddle -- it's got a huge initiative and once you turn [the permafrosts] on, they last for hundreds of years.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Baby Mountain Lion Wounded In Wildfire Fights For His Life", "text": "A young mountain lion is fighting for his life after rescuers were lucky enough to find him among the rubble and ruins of California's rampant wildfires."}, {"title": "Beans Are Just As Filling As Beef, Validating Vegetarians Everywhere", "text": "Next time someone asserts that a meatless dinner doesn't \"feel like a real meal,\" feel free to point them toward this recent study that found beans and beef can be equally satisfying.Researchers from the University of Minnesota served study participants two lunches on two separate days. The first lunch was beef-based meatloaf, and the second was a bean-based meatloaf. Both meatloaves were equivalent in calories, total fat and weight, though the beef meal contained 26 grams of protein and three grams of fiber per serving, while the bean meal provided 17 grams of protein and 12 grams of fiber.Three hours after consuming each of the lunches, participants reported the same amount of fullness. They also ate the same amount of calories for their next meal, indicating they really were equally satiated by both dishes.While the participant group of 28 people was small, the results could contribute to debunking the common myth that vegetarians don't get enough protein. In truth, vegetarians can eat well and feel good.Protein is touted for its ability to keep people fuller for longer periods of time; it's often highlighted as the prime nutrient for losing or maintaining a healthy weight. But fiber, which is found naturally in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, can offer the same benefits and then some.Previous research has found some serious advantages to erring on the side of plant-based nourishment.

What used to be a bite of a blueberry muffin once in a while somehow turned into cheese quesadillas every weekend, and rather than try to reestablish my desire to be and identity as a vegan, I continued to let myself travel down a path of dairy consumption.Then one day on my way to work I got a call from my older brother, a person who has never been vegan or vegetarian, and in fact was one of the staunchest carnivores I have ever met. The first words out of his mouth on our phone call were: \"Dude. I think I'm going vegan.\" There have been plenty of people over the last 6 years that have told me this or something similar, like that they wanted to cut back on their meat consumption, but never would I have ever imagined I would hear these words come out of my brother's mouth. He told me he had watched the documentary Cowspiracy the night before and it completely changed his perspective on food, specifically on meat and dairy products. Without having to even watch the film, I was inspired by my brother's words and actions. If someone who refused to give up meat for any reason could suddenly alter their entire diet in a drastic way, why couldn't I make a simple change and cease eating dairy again? Something deep inside of me felt strange, perhaps even a little guilty every time I ate dairy but I suppressed it, telling myself I was being too hard on myself and that I couldn't expect to be a hero or to be perfect. However, after talking to my brother I was encouraged and energized to return to a completely animal free diet. But I still needed a little bit of a push, so I watched the film.Cowspiracy is a documentary that follows the adventures of a man named Kip as he searches for the leading cause of climate change and the overall decrease in our environment's health. What he found was that meat consumption was the number one factor related to global warming, deforestation, and starvation across the world. With facts on top of data on top of UN reports that all definitively show that animal agriculture is detrimental to our atmosphere, Kip shows the viewer that you cannot eat meat and think you aren't harming the earth. A few facts from the film's website:The documentary is filled with statistics similar to the above three. It's almost overwhelming to watch and you feel like you need to be taking notes. That said, the thing I liked most about this film was that it showed a side of veganism that I think everyone can relate to. I appreciated that this documentary was really geared towards people who care about the environment and who are concerned about climate change -- and that's just about everyone I know. Touching on the drought in my home state California to wild life and rain forests disappearing across the world, this documentary presents information that will speak to viewers from every culture, country, and continent.Another part I liked about the film (that I understand some people may not like) is that there was a small portion dedicated to slaughter and animal cruelty. At one point, Kip explores whether or not raising meat at home is more sustainable than factory farming. He visits a man who raises and slaughters ducks in his own backyard and becomes very disturbed by watching the man chop off the ducks heads and then feather and skin them. Kip even says in an interview afterwards: \"When it gets to this point it's not even about sustainability. I don't feel real good inside.\" I went vegan because of animal cruelty and was excited to learn along the way that being vegan was also good for my health and the environment as well. For my brother, the environmental side was the sticking point for him. Though I have never pushed my views on others or ever considered myself an \"evangelist vegan\" I do think the population needs to be much more educated so everyone can find their sticking point.In conjunction with my brother's epiphany, this film has helped me to revisit the reason I went vegan, to remember why I maintained a vegan diet for so long, and to reset my eating habits to return to a 100% animal free diet. I've seen several videos, have read endless books, and have watched countless documentaries, but this was the first one that made me want to spread the word that going vegan is vital because not only will it stop harming animals, not only will it improve our health, but it will save the planet - and that would be a feat for all of human kind.You can download \"Cowspiracy,\" order the DVD, and also watch it on Netflix."}, {"title": "The Narcissism Behind Our Use of Animals", "text": "The planet is an organism and we are all components of it - parts of the sum. We are of it. We are the planet. There are and have been many peoples whose engagement with the world rests on this ecological cornerstone: every human, animal, insect, plant, mineral, drop of moisture is responsible for contributing, in its unique and equally vital way, to the health and survival of the organism of which we collectively form the whole. There is no one component whose contribution is less crucial than another's, nor is there any one component to whom all others are in service. We all are in collective service to the whole. So it is with every organism, biological or social, if the organism is to remain healthy and to thrive. The payoff for the individual is that the act of keeping the whole on track keeps the individual parts on track. If the organism as a whole appears to be in trouble, we scan its constituent parts to see where one component might have stumbled and caused weakness and instability elsewhere, because one part of the whole being in decline leaves the whole in a state of decline. The health of the Earth can be assessed by examining the relationship of all its component parts.Albert Schweitzer: \"When man learns to respect even the smallest being of creation, whether animal or vegetable, nobody has to teach him to love his fellow man. Compassion for animals is intimately connected with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to animals cannot be a good man.\"In addition to Schweitzer, a Western thinker, the indigenous peoples of this continent had a similar worldview - i.e., identifying with everything as an equally critical part of the cosmos - that held sway until they and it were displaced by Europeans and their way of ascribing meaning to the process of living. The kind of thinking that prevails in much of the world today (and not just in the West) is different. It is based on the notion of humankind as the principal organism to which all else on the planet, including the planet itself, is in service, and everything exists for the human to use. This way of thinking does not allow for interdependent, mutually supportive relationships with our organism cohorts. This way of thinking leads to a tyrannically dominant, exploitative relationship to everything and at all costs, even when that cost is suffering. What kind of mental adjustment has to be made not only to justify causing suffering to something else, but also to develop a comfort level for witnessing that pain?Mahatma Gandhi: \"The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\"There is no shortage of people crying out about inhumane treatment of animals. In fact, there is so much outcry, I wonder how this problem maintains its epidemic proportions. \"Inhumane\" suggests a lack of empathy and remorse; \"epidemic\" describes widespread sickness. There is a sickness here, and it is not animal cruelty. Animal cruelty is the manifestation of the sickness and an extension of a worldview. The sickness is the absence of empathy and remorse that allows causing misery to others without moral compunction.That feature - a lack of empathy - is a primary feature of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which is identified by an exaggerated sense of self-importance and specialness that involves a sense of entitlement and a tendency to be interpersonally exploitative, AND a lack of empathy. Other conditions can develop from NPD, such as sociopathy, though they do not inevitably do so. Nevertheless, narcissism is where such things start. Not every human is a narcissist, and narcissism has not defined every historic moment. However, the general way of thinking today, certainly in our country, about our planet, about our role on it, and about our behavior on it is narcissistic. It is predicated on our considering our own value and needs so greatly as to abandon any sense of value in another that merits similar respect and prioritization. If we can make this mental adjustment to undervalue anything, we can make it to undervalue anyone. And we do.It is important to remember there is no bifurcation of body and mind. When we talk about the mind, we are talking about the brain, which is another physical organ. Mental activity (e.g., ideation, emotions, etc.) is what we use to identify and examine the brain's condition. \"Mental illness\" is an indication of dysfunction in the brain. We do not say elimination is sick when there is diarrhea. We say the GI organs are diseased. Likewise with mental activity and the brain. When we eat an animal, the whole body processes everything that the animal is, and the body is affected by all of it. Our intestines can be vulnerable to another's bacteria; our brain can be vulnerable to another's anguish. We are affected by any kind of toxicity and trauma we take in. If we stopped taking in sick, traumatized animals, the brain, like all our organs, would certainly function differently. Albert Einstein, who got as close as anyone to an appreciation of universal disorder and existential threat, believed we would function not just differently but better without animals as part of our diet.Albert Einstein: \"Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.\"I reference all three of these great thinkers to indicate that the ideas of not using animals as we do and of a plant-based/vegan diet are far from fringe thinking. Knowing so much more now than we ever did, all of us should be able to think, if not like Einstein, then bigger and better than we did in previous centuries. The grizzly details of the factory farming industry are available to all. And if one were to think it through, the only conclusion could be that our exploitation of animals for any purpose causes them extreme suffering. Today, I can meet all my needs without using animals. So, why would I? Yet we continue to make the choice to turn off the empathy-and-remorse switch in order to tolerate our cruelty. We have seen these cognitive contortions before. In order to justify dehumanizing behavior towards slaves, the United States government dehumanized them with the Three-fifths Compromise by devaluing them. Slave-owners had to find a way that was bearable and acceptable to treat African-Americans the way they did. The difference between a boy torturing cats and a factory farmer raising and slaughtering pigs in gruesome conditions is one of social acceptability. Not everyone who eats meat and wears leather shoes will become a Jeffrey Dahmer, but make no mistake, the psychological and ethical modifications, whether conscious or unconscious (we bury in our brains material that is too painful to tolerate), that the slave-owner and the cat torturer and the pig farmer - as well as the complicit end-user - make in order to desensitize themselves to acts of cruelty, are the same: suspending empathy and justifying another's suffering.Thich Nhat Hanh: \"By eating meat we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. The simple act of becoming a vegetarian will make a difference in the health of our planet.\"Narcissism has become a defining feature of the human species. While it is a \"sick\" way of being in the world, it is maladaptive, not absolute. We each can continue to adapt. By choosing to change the way we think and behave, we each can heal what ails the larger organism of which we are a part so we all can be healthier in all ways."}, {"title": "New York Pizza Rat Is The Perfect Metaphor For Something, Surely", "text": "Oh, what's that?

Image from Field Condition.Last week, the New York Times ran a splashy article on Manhattan's new Spring Street Salt Shed. The $20-million, 6,300-square-foot facility will house up to 5,000 tons of sodium chloride, imported from Chile to de-ice the city's roads in winter. Titled \"A Building That Resembles What It Stores,\" the Times feature praises how the architects elevated the mundane function by creating a monumental, origami-like sculpture inspired by salt crystals. Yet, while applauding the building's aesthetics and symbolism, the newspaper neglects to ask an important question about its purpose: Does the city need all that salt?  Road salt can damage both human and ecological health, according to many sources. After snow melts, chlorides from road salt remain in the environment, and there is no natural process by which they are broken down and removed, so they can persist indefinitely, polluting water bodies and hindering survival rates among various species of fauna and flora. Higher salt concentrations in rivers and lakes change their water density, undermining the circulation of nutrients and preventing oxygen from reaching the bottom layers. The US Geological Survey estimates that sodium concentrations in over 40 percent of the country's waterways exceed federal standards. Sodium that makes its way into drinking water supplies can be distasteful to all of us and quite harmful to the third of us who suffer from high blood pressure. Canada officially categorized road salt as a toxin over a decade ago.More directly, if you've noticed how road salt damages your car, you get a sense of how corrosive it can be. The New York Landmarks Conservancy warns that de-icing products can cause \"salt fretting,\" when masonry surfaces scale and flake, mortar joints degrade, and surrounding vegetation suffers. In a report released in January, the New York City Comptroller found that the city annually spends an average of $1.8 million per inch of snow on road salt--$132 million in 2014 alone. The report concluded that the city often uses more salt than it needs, so dollar for dollar the practice is quite literally doing more harm than good.Many communities are exploring \"nature-friendly substitutes\" to road salt, including beet juice and sugarcane molasses. Using cheese brine, Polk County, Wisconsin, cut the amount of salt by 30 percent and the annual expense by nearly a dollar per capita. At that rate, with a population of 8.5 million, New York City could save almost $8 million a year and 175 tons of salt, or 35 times the capacity of the new shed. (I contacted the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to ask whether it has studied alternative methods, but I had not heard back at the time of posting this.) Nearly 30 years ago, in 1987, the New York Times itself encouraged substitutes for road salt, which it estimated caused the US an annual $5 billion in damage ($10.5 billion in 2015 dollars), 20 times the cost of the salt itself. Today the city's \"Cut the Salt Campaign\" promotes low-sodium diets. Why not low-sodium streets?As for the Spring Street Salt Shed, the architect's website declares, \"We believe that each project must ... tread lightly on the environment....\" Does that include a building's contents, or just the building itself?A perennial question among socially and environmentally conscious architects is whether we are responsible for the impact of our work beyond the building itself. Is it possible to design a \"green\" missile silo, or sustainable storage for plutonium? Should the use of my projects weigh on my conscience, or is that someone else's problem?But even the empty shed raises questions about \"treading lightly.\" The structure is composed of 6-foot-thick panels of concrete, an extremely energy-intensive material, since producing a ton of cement requires nearly 5 million BTUs of energy, the equivalent of about 400 pounds of coal. The second most consumed substance on earth (after water), concrete's manufacture is one of the primary producers of carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to climate change. Furthermore, the Times article highlights that the concrete was cast from huge molds of polystyrene (the generic name for Styrofoam), which the EPA considers the fifth largest source of hazardous waste in the US. The process of making it can causes many adverse health effects, including skin irritation, respiratory ailments, headaches, and fatigue, and it is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource, polystyrene is not biodegradable and can take decades, even centuries, to break down in a landfill.A veritable monument to sodium, the Spring Street Shed--and therefore road salt--could be around for a very long time. As quoted in the Times, the architect imagines \"visitors in the distant future stumbling upon the shed in the way Charlton Heston's character encounters the Statue of Liberty ruins in 'Planet of the Apes.'\" Why build such a functionally specific and long-lasting structure when the function it supports is already outmoded? A spokesperson for the city told the Times that future observers might wonder, \"Why did these people worship salt?\"Good question.Follow Lance Hosey on Twitter: @lancehosey"}, {"title": "Will the Pope's DC Visit Bring New Political Leadership on Climate Justice?", "text": "Earlier this year, Pope Francis authored a 200-page letter to church leaders around the world, grounding the moral call for climate action in centuries of Catholic social teachings and explicitly linking climate change and other fundamental issues of justice such as economic inequality. This week he will address Congress, with this issue likely to be a major part of his message.As someone who works for an organization that approaches the problem of climate change from the perspective of the world's poorest and most vulnerable communities, I welcome the spotlight that Pope Francis has been putting on the moral dimension of climate justice. But the Pope's moral leadership for climate justice clearly shows that we desperately need political leadership to change policies and regulations and start to build a more just and sustainable world.Where might that political leadership come from?If you said \"Congress\" or \"negotiators at the United Nations climate talks,\" well, I admire your optimism.If you said \"the Obama administration,\" it would be nice if this were true. Unfortunately, the administration's climate policy has been contradictory at best. The Clean Power Plan is an important initiative, full and effective implementation of which is a must. But the administration continues to pursue an all-of-the-above energy policy, opening up drilling in Alaska while knowing full well that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground if we are to solve the climate crisis.Furthermore, many are trumpeting the Obama administration's \"climate leadership\" at the international level - especially at the United Nations' climate talks that will culminate in a summit Paris this December. Unfortunately, the U.S. is deeply constrained by a Congress controlled by climate denialists. In this context, U.S. \"leadership\" in these spaces essentially means that international climate policymaking is being held hostage by Congressional Republicans.Do we really want to let a global agreement for climate action be brought down by the lowest common denominator of climate denialism? That road leads to disaster.Unfortunately, the fact is that political leadership on climate action is tough to come by amongst world leaders - who are too influenced by powerful, entrenched interests that are resistant to the kind of transformational change needed to address the crisis. Real leadership has to come from the bottom up.And this is where there's hope. There are amazing things happening around the world in response to climate change. Prices for technologies like small solar panels have fallen dramatically, providing huge opportunities for clean, affordable, decentralized energy access for all, including the world's poorest. Impacted communities in some of the poorest countries in the world are demonstrating their resilience and ingenuity by leading the way on innovative community- and ecosystem-based solutions to climate adaptation, such as agro-ecological approaches to food security.While people and communities are leading the way on solutions, they are also fueling a vibrant global movement pushing for the just transition to a new sustainable economy. Here at home, frontline communities fighting pipelines and extractive industries, divestment efforts, and congregations and faith-based organizations are leading with a vision for a just, sustainable world. And many of these people will come together in DC and New York later this week in a big show of support for climate justice.Internationally, a series of mobilizations around the world both before and after the Paris summit will signal that whatever happens at that summit, people are organizing and will put huge pressure on political leaders to follow through on their commitments and, indeed, strengthen them significantly so that they actually live up to the scale and urgency of the problem.How does the Pope fit into all of this? If his papal letter and address to Congress can spur further climate activism in the US, and force obstinate members of Congress to think through the real implications of climate denial - or at least marginalize those who refuse to face up to reality - it would provide a huge boost to an already growing demand for climate justice.The link between creation care and care for the poorest and most vulnerable is something that has never been more important. The Catholic Church is hardly perfect when it comes to being socially and politically progressive, but the long Catholic social justice tradition is powerful and reaches billions of people. In that spirit the Pope's leadership on climate justice is powerful and necessary - now is the time for political leaders to follow suit, and for people to demand that they do so."}, {"title": "Baby Mountain Lion Wounded In Wildfire Fights For His Life", "text": "A young mountain lion is fighting for his life after rescuers were lucky enough to find him among the rubble and ruins of California's rampant wildfires."}, {"title": "Ripple Effect: The People's Climate March One Year Later", "text": "One year ago today, I was standing at the top of Sixth Avenue here in New York City with 400,000 others at the People's Climate March. We stood with our hands raised together in the air -- mothers, students, workers, doctors, climate activists -- each of us there because we believed in the unifying slogan of the day: to change everything, we need everyone.We stood in silence, until suddenly, like a wave, a roar came echoing up the city canyon. Trumpets, drums and cheers echoed from Times Square all the way to the top of Central Park. Whistles and voices echoed off the city walls. With our silence, we acknowledged the lives lost to this crisis. With our noise, we celebrated the lives dedicated to solving it.Two days before the march, I'd told a reporter from Rolling Stone that, \"Organizing a big march is like throwing a rock in a pond. The splash is exciting, but the real beauty is in the ripples. I'm confident the energy from this march will ripple out in all directions, from fossil fuel divestment fights on campus to the push for a global climate treaty in Paris.\"The splash was indeed exciting. The People's Climate March dominated the news cycle, from huge TV coverage (including, much to my pleasure, on Fox News) to an above the fold spread in the New York Times. Along with the main event in New York, there were thousands of solidarity marches around the world, each generating loads of attention. The hashtag #PeoplesClimate had over 1 billion impressions. The day after the march, world leaders from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to President Obama talked about the march and the need to \"heed the call\" of people in the streets.But the real beauty has been in the ripples -- shockwaves that have traveled even farther and faster than we could have predicted at the time. Here in NYC, we've seen a strong year of organizing on the ground, with groups like ALIGN, UPROSE, and NYC Environmental Justice Alliance continuing to lead the way. Our temporary People's Climate Arts space, May Day, has become a permanent addition to the community and new \"Sporatoriums,\" the creative meet-ups where artists plotted the amazing themes and visuals of the march, continue to take place.Meanwhile, the divestment movement I referenced in the quote has grown in leaps and bounds. The day after the People's Climate March, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced that they would divest from fossil fuels. At the time, around 120 institutions representing roughly $50 billion in capital had made a divestment commitment. Since then, thanks to the tireless work of divestment activists, especially on college campuses, the number of commitments has surged to over 400 institutions (we'll be getting the full numbers on the amount of capital at a press conference on September 22). Those new commitments include huge pools of money, like the University of California System, the insurance giant AXA, and the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund.The divestment wave has helped build momentum throughout society for the transition away from fossil fuels. As some institutions commit to divest, many are also choosing to switch to 100% renewable electricity. And as our schools, companies, and places of worship take action, politicians are beginning to follow. This June, G7 leaders committed for the first time to phase out the use of fossil fuels and the goal will now be on the table for the climate talks in Paris this December. There's still much more work to be done -- long term goals without short term commitments often amount to little more than just empty rhetoric -- but there are days where it really feels like the tide is beginning to turn.We're not organizing another march in New York City this year. Setting aside Star Wars and the Godfather, sequels are rarely better, and successful social movements rarely use the same tactic over and over again. Instead, we're mobilizing this year in Paris and around the world. There will be actions in the US on October 18th, huge marches around the world over the weekend of November 28-29th, escalated action on December 12th, and more major demonstrations taking on the fossil fuel industry next April.Some years you throw one big rock, other years you throw a series of stones. Both can help rock the boats of power and create ripples that carry our movement forward. The real lesson for me from the People's Climate March wasn't about the last word \"march\" but about the first word \"people.\" Our work will take many forms over the coming years, from community organizing to mass mobilization, but if we can keep people at the forefront, especially those who are already dealing with the worst impacts of climate change and our pollution based economy, than I'm confident we can keep moving forward.

Delays of a decade or longer are common. Now, ironically, it turns out that years spent in environmental review dramatically harm the environment.A new study by Common Good, which I led, found that delays in replacing obsolete infrastructure prolong massive amounts of pollution. America's antiquated power grid wastes six percent of total electricity -- the equivalent of 200 coal-burning power plants. Delays in permitting wind farms and other renewable power projects cause over 350 million tons of carbon to be released annually by plants using fossil fuels. (Review and permitting of the Cape Wind project in Massachusetts took nine years, and the litigation still continues.) Road bottlenecks cause traffic congestion, burning almost 2 billion extra gallons of gasoline each year. Leaky pipes, many installed a century ago, waste 2.1 trillion gallons of water. Waterways are polluted because inadequate sewage treatment plants overflow whenever there's a big storm. Desperately needed infrastructure projects languish for years. The Carlsbad desalination plant in water-parched California is opening this year, 12 years after it applied for permits.  Permitting delays also cause a cascade of other harmful effects. Six extra years of red tape more than doubles the overall cost of projects. Prolonging inefficient bottlenecks in roads, railroads, waterways and air traffic compromises American competitiveness. Worthwhile projects die or languish on the drawing board -- politicians lose interest because delays are longer than a normal political cycle.Environmental review, when mandated by Congress in 1970, was supposed to foster better decisions. No one expected it to delay projects by more than a few months. Current regulations by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, created by Congress to oversee environmental review, state that environment impact statements should not be longer than 300 ages even in the most complex projects.Environmental review has instead evolved into an agonizing crawl through years of meetings and mind-numbing detail. A project to raise the roadway of the Bayonne Bridge has almost no environmental impact -- it uses the same foundations and right of way -- but nonetheless required a 10,000 page environmental assessment. In another project, to expand a dock on the west coast, the initial \"scoping meetings\" took two years; only then could consultants even begin their review. The Savannah River dredging project consumed 14 years in environmental reviews. Such is the slow trudge through environmental review.What happened is that, at the height of judicial activism in the 1970s, courts decided they would take a \"hard look\" at any environmental review statement. Environmental groups naturally accepted the invitation to challenge the detail of reviews. It gave them a legal bargaining chip.The adequacy of environmental review -- not the wisdom the project -- became the battlefield for new projects. Reviews got longer and longer as stakeholders girded for litigation over whether the project proponents overturned every conceivable pebble. Former EPA General Counsel E. Donald Elliott estimates than 90% of the detail of environmental review is a response to potential claims in litigation.The dynamic of delay is easy to understand. Every project has some harmful side effects. A desalination plant produces a briny byproduct. A wind farm mars nature views. A third rail tunnel under the Hudson will require huge digging and will dislocate people on the approach routes. Any group that doesn't like a project, or prefers it to be redesigned, can raise numerous issues, and threaten litigate if not satisfied. Years go by as participants tiptoe through a legal minefield. Meanwhile, bottlenecks and obsolete plants spew pollution into our air and water.The Senate has passed a streamlining bill which would create a 16-agency Council to discuss and decide issues around permitting, including environmental review. Unfortunately it's not likely to speed things up much. A Committee of 16 is not a formula for action. What happens when one official (or his boss) feels really strongly that another agency is wrong? I asked one of the drafters who had authority to resolve disputes, and the answer was: Nobody.The debate here is in the wrong dimension. The tension is not about cost vs. careful decisions, but progress vs. paralysis. Environmental review and public input are important, but only in a prescribed time frame. Other greener countries such as Germany have environmental review, but finish all review and permitting within one to two years -- not a decade or longer.What's needed here is simple: Give an official (probably the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality) authority to actually decide how much environmental review is needed. \"Oh, the bridge is using the same foundations and right of way? Just provide a summary description of construction costs.\" Most reviews should be completed within months, not years or decades. That official answers to the President. Courts are available if someone ignores the law, but not for immaterial disputes.Environmental review and permits should be completed in two years or less, not ten years. The quest for environmental perfection should be replaced by a practical assessment of what's really important. There's only one known way to cut through the bickering and red tape: Create clear lines of authority.Modernizing America's infrastructure has an upside as rosy as the downside today is dire. America can enhance its competitiveness. Upwards of two million jobs can be created. And the environment will be far cleaner."}, {"title": "Syrian Teen Who Fled Country Refused To Leave His Puppy Behind", "text": "A Syrian teen who fled his home in search of safety refused to leave his beloved dog behind.In a video from the U.N.

We Can Do Better", "text": "This Friday, Blumhouse Productions will release a film titled \"The Green Inferno,\" directed by Eli Roth. The film depicts a group of student activists who travel from New York City to the Amazon forest to \"save\" a tribe. Their plane crashes, and the tribe takes the group hostage and engages in cannibalism, killing them one by one.Yes, you read that right - in 2015, the silver screen will present the story of American saviors who go to the rainforest to save an uncivilized tribe, but the tribe shows how savage it truly is and turns on said saviors.Racist portrayals of indigenous people are all too common - whether it's a sports mascot perpetuating the noble savage stereotype or a grunting buckskin-clad brave brought to life by Hollywood, America refuses to let go of the ideology that Native Americans are a people of the past.\"The Green Inferno\" takes it up a notch. Why feature historical tribal savages when you can set the story in modern times and show the tribe actually eating people?Indignation about the incredibly offensive depiction of indigenous people aside, this couldn't have come at a worse time for real-life Amazonian tribes.Logging, mining, and drilling have resulted in deforestation and increased competition for the resources that remain. Outside contact with isolated tribes brings the threat of diseases they lack immunity to, and destruction of their cultures.Peru recently proposed to end its no-contact policy set in place to protect isolated tribes in the Amazon region, a move that some indigenous rights groups believe is tied to corporate pressure to open the land for oil, gas, timber, and gold. The government has since retreated on the proposal, suggesting that the tribes should seek contact first.But therein lies the harm - in the midst of competing interests to protect indigenous peoples or capitalize on the Amazon's natural resources, out comes a film portraying tribes as bloodthirsty savages.Despite Roth's assertion that a fictional film causing harm to existing peoples is \"absurd\", presenting an at-risk population as cannibalistic beasts feeds into the mantra of saving, assimilating and educating uncivilized tribes for their own good (and the good of resource-hungry corporations). Stereotypes and dehumanization have very real consequences.Roth himself joked about the impact of his film crew to the Amazonian tribe he located and featured in his film, \"We [had] to tell them what a movie is...They've never even seen a television...[B]y the end they were all playing with iPhones and iPads. We've completely polluted the social system and f*cked them up.\"These days, Roth is attempting to soothe the many environmental and indigenous rights organizations that have denounced his impending film. He's joined a campaign to preserve the rainforest and partnered with a charity to start a journalism fund highlighting the issues faced by indigenous peoples.He recently told Variety he \"made 'The Green Inferno' to spark discussion and bring awareness to the devastation these tribes face at the hands of corporations.\" That's a far cry from a man who earlier stated that he wanted to make a cannibal film but needed the right storyline.Throwing money at indigenous peoples to continue perpetuating racist imagery is a familiar tactic. Perhaps Roth should take note of how well the Original Americans Foundation has done in its efforts to buy tribal support of a racial caricature.The Paiute Tribe of Utah impeached the tribal chair earlier this summer for accepting bribes from the foundation, and just last month the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe rejected $25,000 offered by the Redsk*ns organization.Even if it's paid for, racism is still racism. The almighty dollar doesn't mitigate dehumanization. If Roth has concerns about the plight of Amazonian tribes, perhaps he could use his platform to expose the threats to their homelands and way of life instead of portraying them as animalistic cannibals.To show your support for halting distribution of \"The Green Inferno,\" a petition can be found at causes.com.*Note: this post originally appeared in Indian Country Today."}, {"title": "GOP's New Climate Talking Point", "text": "This is the second of two posts about the latest Republican presidential debate. The first is posted here.Since President George H.W. Bush signed off on the world's first climate treaty more than 20 years ago, the denial industry has been searching for a talking point that would accomplish two goals. First, it would discredit the science. Second, it would stand up to scrutiny.There has been a long history of failed talking points since then. Among them: Scientists are making things up so they can get grants; environmentalists want to kill American jobs and take away everyone's Hummers; President Obama is a socialist; and the United Nations is trying to create world government. None of them worked, or so we must conclude since sizable majorities of Americans accept that climate change is real and must be addressed.Now the denial industry has developed a new talking point that is being recited by some of the Republican Party's presidential candidates. Sadly for them, this one doesn't stand up to scrutiny either. In fact, it comes dangerously close to putting the candidates on common ground with climate activists. That probably is not what the denial industry intended.The new talking point is this: America cannot solve the climate problem alone; therefore we should not do anything. Sen. Marco Rubio tried to make this argument during last week's CNN debate when he informed us that \"America is not a planet\". Carly Fiorina is making that argument, too. Here is what she said in an interview last month with CNBC's John Harwood:HARWOOD: \"Do you believe that humans contribute to climate change and that government ought to do something about it?\"FIORINA: \"I believe if you're going to go to science, you need to read the fine print. And here's what the scientists say: A single nation acting alone can make no difference at all.\"There are several reasons why climate activists must be delighted at this argument. First, at least one of the GOP's candidates apparently has read the large body of reports from the world's climate scientists, right down to the fine print. Second, the \"we can't do it alone\" argument acknowledges there is something to be done. Third, the fact that America cannot solve the climate problem alone is precisely why the United States is working with more than 190 other nations that will meet in Paris later this year in hopes of agreeing on an international climate treaty. It is why the Obama Administration has negotiated climate and clean energy agreements with some of the world's other large carbon emitters including China, India and Brazil. And it is why the Republican leaders in Congress should stop trying to sabotage the global climate deal.Writing about Fiorina's statement, David French of the conservative National Review concluded that she has found \"how to address the Left on climate change\". The fact that America can't solve global warming alone, he wrote, \"may represent the best, and most easily defensible, path forward to consensus.\"He would be correct if the defensible path to consensus led to Paris. Instead, he probably meant we should all agree to throw in the towel.In her conversation with Harwood, Fiorina offered several other arguments that do not withstand scrutiny. Here are some of them followed by reality checks.FIORINA: \"The only answer to this (climate) problem, according to the scientists, is a three-decade global effort, coordinated and costing trillions of dollars. Are you kidding? It'll never happen.\"History offers many examples of sustained and successful international collaborations. Imagine what the world would be like today if Ronald Reagan had brushed off nuclear arms control or the need to end the Cold War with \"Are you kidding? It'll never happen\".FIORINA: \"We ought to say, \"We're going to become the global energy powerhouse of the 21st century\".\"I don't know anyone who would disagree. The argument is over what type of energy would make us a powerhouse. Fossil fuels are the resources of the 20th century, not the 21st. The pressure is mounting to slow climate change by keeping most of the known reserves of fossil fuels in the ground.The most dynamic global energy markets today are in clean and renewable resources. A formidable body of research substantiates this. For example, a report earlier this year from Pew Charitable Trusts and Bloomberg New Energy Finance concludes, \"The world's energy dynamic is changing in response to powerful economic, security and environmental forces\"; the clean energy sector has become a \"$300 billion fixture of the world economy\"; and \"renewable energy will supply the majority of worldwide power capacity added through 2030.\"   If we hope to become the world's energy powerhouse, we need to be on the right side of this century's energy markets.FIORINA: When the Chinese said to Obama, \"Oh, we're going to come up with a deal with you, we're going to stop increasing our global greenhouse emissions by 2025,\" you know what they were doing? They were simply lifting a goal out of a five-year plan and saying, \"We'll play along.\" They're not playing along.Aren't they? Fiorina might ask herself why a reduction in emissions is part of China's five-year plan in the first place. It has nothing to do with public relations, altruism, concern for its children's future, its desire to be friends with the United States, or an obligation to the world community. It is driven by the threat that the Chinese people will lose confidence in their central government, or worse, because of unabated pollution. As the New York Times reported back in 2007:Environmental degradation is now so severe, with such stark domestic and international repercussions, that pollution poses not only a major long-term burden on the Chinese public but also an acute political challenge to the ruling Communist Party.That remains the case today. The combustion of fossil fuels produces not only greenhouse gas emissions but also the pollutants responsible for smog, acid rain, regional haze and respiratory problems. In China as in other places, many of the steps we must take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also reduce these other emissions. Since that is in the interest of China's leaders, Reagan's approach to their commitment would be, \"trust but verify\".FIORINA: \"The answer is innovation...That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation--with innovation.\"There is common ground here, too. Everybody considers innovation essential to confronting climate change, especially innovation at sufficient scale, speed and market penetration to matter. Fiorina is wrong, however, to suggest that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive. The best way to address global warming is for innovation and government regulation to work in concert. Smart regulation inspires innovation. That was the case 30 years ago when it became clear to DuPont that governments would regulate CFCs, the cause of the so-called ozone hole. DuPont, the biggest producers of CFCs, jumped on the opportunity to create alternatives and to become a leader in the new market created by regulation.Today, the Obama Administration's new limits on carbon emissions from power plants already are spurring innovation, according to the Advanced Energy Economy Institute (AEE). AEE cites other examples where government rules combined with market forces bred innovation:By setting a regulatory signal and allowing for market-based compliance mechanisms, EPA rules have initiated the development of active and efficient markets in reducing the lead content in gasoline, combatting acid rain, and controlling regional transport of ozone due to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These prior regulatory programs offer strong evidence that industry responds rapidly and effectively to regulatory signals set by EPA when market-based compliance mechanisms are allowed, enabling the development and delivery of a wide array of compliance solutions at low cost.The government policies that inhibit market-leading innovation today are federal subsidies of carbon fuels and the failure of Congress to assign a price to carbon.* * *When the leading Republican candidates for president gathered in the Reagan Library for the CNN debate last week, they should have taken time to look up what President Reagan said about environmental issues like global warming. \"If we've learned any lessons during the past few decades, perhaps the most important is that preservation of our environment is not a partisan challenge; it's common sense,\" he said in 1984. \"Our physical health, our social happiness, and our economic well-being will be sustained only by all of us working in partnership as thoughtful, effective stewards of our natural resources.\"In 1964, nearly two decades before he became president, Reagan said, \"You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down...You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's children say of us we justified our brief moment here.

Religion's complicity with the privilege of wealth and status, coupled with the consumptive habits of its adherents who live with an ethos of acquisitiveness, has conspired to render religion utterly useless to do what it was built to do: prevent the greatest injustice and resulting disaster this planet has ever known.There is going to come a time when my grandchild is going to ask me: \"What did you know; and when did you know it.\" There will be little to say in response. I chose not to know what was there to be known until it was too late. It would be very easy for me, a liberal who is the leader of one of religion's most progressive institutions, to point the finger at climate deniers from other religious traditions and blame them for the great cover up.But a.) that hides the bitter truth about my and my church's responsibility for doing too little too late; just enough, really, to afford us the opportunity to point the finger at someone else and once again feel self-righteous about what we did; and b.) it doesn't matter: when your ship is sinking and all the inhabitants aboard it are dying it doesn't do any good to convene a task force to figure out who's to blame.I'm going to both Washington DC and to New York next week to participate in a series of events at which religious leaders from across the faith spectrum and the country will gather to celebrate Pope Francis' visit. Our particular focus will be his recent encyclical on climate change: Laudato Si'.If religion is to matter ever again, it must use its collective agency for change to transform life on this planet as we know it. This is a hard ask, and one that religion has refused to accept yet.As a leader of the United Church of Christ, I am certainly proud of the partnerships we have utilized throughout our history to effect meaningful and lasting change. From abolitionist movements to civil rights crusades; from a call for suffrage to the development of feminist, womanist, and queer theologies; from marriage equality to LGBT ordination rights; from the call to open the airwaves to local radio outlets to labor justice; from private prisons to refugee and immigrant justice: this religious movement of which I am a part has proven its bona fides in the justice arena.This may be our greatest test of faith. Can we conspire to solve the justice issue that will trump all others? If we don't solve this one, every other justice issue will cease to be a justice issue before too long as the planet rejects and ejects from it every species this evolutionary cycle has produced, in order to heal itself and make way for others millions of years from now.We are burning down the house.

Francis uses the encyclical to intelligently weave these various strands together, ultimately calling for a larger dialogue between all concerned groups regardless of religious affiliations or beliefs, in order to form common cause for a better world. Particularly moving are Francis' poignant references to the social justice implications of climate change and his pointing to the larger issues of social inequality, the plight of the poor and oppressed, the lifestyles of the wealthy and the values of consumer culture as all being inextricably entwined. He brings home the point that you cannot be working for one cause without working for systemic change on all of these fronts.   [Source: Public Domain Images Pope Francis Google.com]On the scientific front, a new book from Yale University Press/ Templeton's \"Foundational Questions in Science\" series, Does Altruism Exist? Culture, Genes and the Welfare of Others, by David Sloan Wilson, articulates a fascinating new paradigm from evolutionary biology that ties in with this broader transformational shift. In it, Wilson differentiates between natural selection for individuals and natural selection at what is called the \"group\", or \"multi-level.\" While at an individual level, natural selection often operates in a selfish, survival-of-the-fittest fashion, at the group level (think of group dynamics within larger eco-systems), it selects for structures and processes that serve the well being of the whole, and not self-interest groups. In other words, evolution is trending toward a world that works for all. This is a radical reversal of standard evolutionary understanding, with grave consequences for how we function at the societal level in groups, including economically, politically, religiously, and so on. State these scientists, in the words of the author, and colleague E. O. Wilson (Harvard University's father of modern sociobiology), in the process of natural selection, \"Altruistic groups beat selfish groups.\"In other words, when it comes to group relations, nature prefers structures and processes that serve the whole, and not narrow self-interests. Then there is, as D. S. Wilson also says in his book, no mystery why our world is now sinking with its load of dysfunctional organizational principles.   [Source: Interspiritual Network, co-author Kurt Johnson]If, in fact, nature is not only friendly to altruism, but prefers it, perhaps social idealists of all kinds--sacred and secular activists--are not swimming upstream in an uncaring and cruel evolutionary process, as the decades-long mantras of the selfish gene, Social Darwinism, and neo-liberal economics would have us believe. It also provides insight into the resistance to the Pope's Encyclical on \"Care of our Common Home\" from many traditional, conservative, and fundamentalist cultural, religious, and economic leaders and communities.Echoed in these emergences, and the pushback against them, are the words of integral philosopher Ken Wilber in a presentation to a \"From Self Care to Earth Care\" Conference in Denver, Colorado in July. Warned Wilber, some 70% of the world's religions are still \"stuck\" at the \"magic/ mythic/ literalist\" level (or style) of religious practice, which is built on the ethos of \"My worldview is right and yours is wrong.\" Unfortunately, the way such religious conflicts have played out historically, wrong also meant \"dead wrong.\"Yet, there is also, he said, a dynamic flux today between the tug of this and more modern, holistic, and world-centric cosmologies and worldviews. Indeed, first world statistics show a significant shift (in America from 20% generally, to 70% of \"millennials\") identifying as \"spiritual but not religious\" and some 90% identifying with tolerance and inter-cultural harmony. Science cannot be left out of this context either. As Wilber points out, our worldviews often stem from our cosmologies. Therefore, the fact that science too is in flux, depending on the cultural context, is heartening.Sacred Activists have always found the conventional global stage an uphill climb, even from the time of that other Francis, Francis of Assisi. Yet, this Pope Francis will address both the United Nations and the United States Congress in September. The United Nations (attended this time by more heads of state than at any other time in history) will adopt a new development agenda for the world future and then move on \"the Road to Paris\" to the \"World Climate Summit 2015\" in December. Hopes are, and should stay, high.  [Source: http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/]We cannot help but note, from our above review of these highly convergent times, that this time several factors will be historically unique. The Encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" will have been a direct response by religion to science, as well as a passionate call for collaborative dialogue and communicative action among disparate groups. Further, evolutionary science will be painting, for the first time in history, the view of an evolutionary process friendly to the actions of sacred and secular activism for real transformative change.It is a far cry, perhaps, as David Sloan Wilson says in Does Altruism Exist?--a book whose scientific conclusions should buoy all activists--to think our globe's political and economic systems, still in the ethos of self-interest (if not greed, exploitation, or worse) will mend their ways. But it is resounding good news to all of good conscience, and the activists and altruists among them, to know that the evolutionary process itself may be solidly on their side, and that today there is a major convergence of civil society organizations to create a world that works for all."}, {"title": "I Used To Think The Right Answer Was To Lead A Balanced Life", "text": "Sophia is a project to collect life lessons from fascinating people. You can share your own wisdom here.Today we hear from Rebecca Moore, who founded and oversees Google Earth Outreach, which helps nonprofits use Google's mapping technology to tackle issues like deforestation, climate change, and disease outbreaks.What is a recent realization you've had about living a more rewarding/fulfilling life?When I was younger, I used to think that the right answer was to lead a balanced life. That's what you hear. And I'm not balanced. Like, instead of doing exercise for this part of the day, and spiritual stuff for that part of the day, and work for this part of the day, I do things in epochs in my life. I was like an insane rock-climbing mountaineer for 10 years. And then I was insanely into academia and education. And now I'm insanely into saving the planet with maps through my work. My life has been really different in each of those phases. I’ve decided that's fine.I have a very dear friend, Victoria Sweet, she's a physician, she's a scholar, she's an author, she recently published a book -- very highly regarded, award-winning, called God's Hotel. She runs two miles a day, she writes for four hours, and then she takes the rest of the day off. And she does this every day.I used to aspire to that. But that's not me. So, we admire each other, even though I do things very differently from the way she does it. I think what I've learned is: I don't have to lead a balanced life every day. I just have to lead a life that works for me. It's balanced in aggregate.Relationships are part of that, too. You have relationships, and those are part of your daily existence. They've been part of my life, but not every day. And that's fine.What do you feel is the most helpful thing your parents did for you that many parents don't do?I really admired my parents. My dad was an attorney. He was quite intellectual -- Harvard, Harvard Law. But he was also an activist. He argued a civil rights case that went all the way up to the Supreme Court and won. Then Greenpeace approached him and asked him if he would help, because there was kind of a similar case.It seems odd that an environmental issue and a civil rights issue would need the same kind of legal remedy, but his approach was basically: Should the public have legal standing before federal regulatory agencies? In the 1960s, they didn't. The public didn't matter.So in the civil rights case, an NBC affiliate in Jackson, Mississippi was extremely discriminatory. Medgar Evers, a civil rights activist, was assassinated, and it related to what was happening on this television station. The public rose up and said this television station needs to have their license revoked.They put an argument together to the [Federal Communications Commission] that this broadcast license for this NBC station in Mississippi should be revoked. The FCC said: “You don't have any standing. You don't have any legal even right to express an opinion to us, because you're just the public. Only those who have an economic stake in a broadcast license have any legal standing to present a brief to us.\"So my dad argued that the public, who had bought television sets within the radius of the NBC station’s transmitter, had spent more money on their TVs than the station owner was spending on operating the station. So they did have an economic stake in what was broadcast.It eventually was appealed to the Supreme Court. My dad argued it and won.So the public now had standing, had the right to express an opinion. So then Greenpeace approached him and said, \"We're trying to present some arguments to the Environmental Protection Agency, and they're saying we don't have standing because we're just the public.\" So he took that on -- he did these for free -- he took that on pro bono and won again.Now it's a precedent that they teach in law school, that the public has standing before federal regulatory agencies. The public has the right to have their opinions heard.That was really influential on me. I learned that you can use your profession and make a difference. It's not like you can either be an activist or you can be a lawyer. You can actually be both.Then my older brother was a painter, an artist, Frank Moore. He was very influential. He would do paintings that The New Yorker described as Hieronymus Bosch meets the Hudson River School. They were allegorical paintings that wove together themes of environmental and human health. And he had AIDS, he lived with AIDS for 15 years. He was the person who conceived the red ribbon.So again, I used to follow him around because he was just unbelievably creative, and could do anything, was very inspiring. He was an artist-activist.Meanwhile, I'm this computer scientist, and I'm doing jobs in Silicon Valley, building Pascal compilers and voicemail systems and things like that. They were both huge fans of me, advisors of me, they were my heroes. They were like, \"You could do more, Rebecca. You could do more with your talents, your gifts to make a difference.\"I always had this feeling that I was supposed to do something that mattered, but I couldn't figure out what it was. Then my father died in 2001 and my brother died five months later. It rocked my world. Everything stopped, because they were gone now.I felt like the baton was really being passed to me. What are you going to do? Time is short. What are you spending your time on? Is that what really matters? How can you make a difference with your gifts?So I quit my job, and I spent three years trying to answer that question. I went back to school in bioinformatics, because the human genome had just been sequenced and there was this new era of personalized medicine, where based upon your genetic profile, using computer analysis and artificial intelligence and all this stuff that I was very good at, we would be able to give better diagnoses, better treatments.I thought that's it. Right? Obviously, right? Like who doesn't want to cure cancer? So I threw myself into that for three years, and I got A+'s and got a degree. It was intellectually interesting and there were all these opportunities. But it wasn't me. It wasn't the right answer.Meanwhile, while it's going on, I live in the Santa Cruz mountains. It's very different up there. It's surprisingly rural even though we're half an hour from Silicon Valley. The roads are all managed by the communities -- we pave our own roads, we clear the brush; if trees fall down, the guys get the chainsaws out and clear the road. We have our own water systems that we manage.We know when the next big earthquake happens, it's going to be a long time before anybody comes to help us. But I love that, because it's a surprisingly frontier feeling.So there I am in school on bioinformatics, and suddenly I guess what happened is, everything got much simpler for me. Instead of figuring out, How am I going to cure cancer? How are you going to argue a case before the Supreme Court or invent the red ribbon? I thought, just do something small.Just look out in your neighborhood. What can you do that's small? Get rid of your ego about all this. It's not about Rebecca Moore saving the world. If you really want to make a difference, start making a difference in a way that no one would consider to be important, but you know it's helpful.So I started looking for opportunities to do that. There was a case where one of my neighbors called 911 because her husband was having a medical emergency, and it took two hours for the ambulance to get to their house. There were no maps of our roads because they're not managed by the county, they're managed by us. It was crazy. The map of my road that the emergency responders had was shocking -- hand-drawn in pencil from 1983. You're like, this cannot be the map. It's the map that was proudly used by the police, the sheriff, the fire department.So I was kind of concerned. Meanwhile, there were new GPS devices and different mapping tools, and I was like, \"What if I made a map of our road that had all the houses, and it was accurate, and I gave that to you. Would you guys use it?\" And they were like, \"Sure.\"So I started to look around for different mapping software and I stumbled on Keyhole. That's what became Google Earth. I was like, this is unbelievable. You've got all the satellite imagery, you've got the mountains, you've got the topography. All the roads were there, so all I have to do is overlay our house information and it can route for you. This is amazing.I also organized to make a community network of hiking trails. My neighbors and I, we all have like 10 acres, with old logging roads and deer paths. But when people want to go hiking, they get in their car, and they drive 45 minutes to a state park. I'm like, that's crazy! We live in this beautiful area with huge canyons -- you should see it. Why don't we organize ourselves and just connect my deer path to your logging trail? And people were like, \"Okay.\"So again, I used mapping and so forth to do that. I ended up making this big map of our mountain region that had all of the fire departments and all of the emergency response and different features on it. The volunteer fire department said, \"Oh, my God, where did you get that? We'll pay you anything for that.\" And I said how could this be? I'm just sort of self-taught in this. How is it that this is some major breakthrough?This sounds like I'm bragging, but I began to realize that there was really a gap in our community around having information for emergency response, for recreation, for safety, that could be solved with modern digital maps. And with things like Keyhole and GPS devices, anyone could make a map. And I loved it, because my background was in hiking and nature, and I've always been a map geek.So how did this lead you to Google?Well, it's funny. I was doing projects using three different mapping technologies that were out at that time. I learned a lot of lessons from that, and I thought Google might be interested in this, because Google had just bought one of them, Keyhole.Meanwhile, I was continually breaking Keyhole. I would send bug reports in like, \"I broke it in this way. I think there's a condition between the client and the server. I can replicate it in the following way.\" And I kept sending these in. They're finally like, \"Who are you and what are you doing?\"I said, \"I'm happy to come in and talk to you about it.\" So they invited me to come in, and now they were part of Google. Google Earth had not yet come out. But they had bought Keyhole, and they were moving it over to the Google infrastructure.I came in and gave a tech talk about building community geoportals using these three different mapping technologies, and what I thought was the best one and why. And of course I ended up saying I thought Keyhole was the best. If Google just did these 10 things, it would just knock it out of the park. And they said, \"Do you want a job?\" And I said, \"Yes. I do.\" So that's how it started.In fact, when they interviewed me, they said, \"We're thinking of calling it Google Earth. What do you think about that?\" I'm like, \"It's bold. Google Earth. It's bold, but I think you could do it. I think you could pull it off.\" And, of course, they did. We did.You found a way to merge this work with activism.Google Earth came out in June. I got the job offer in July, I was going to start in the end of August. And in August I got this map in the mail. You see that, black and white?All my 2,000 neighbors and I, we get that map, we get that notice in the mail -- “Notice of Intent to Harvest Timber” around our houses.The CDF [California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection], they rubber-stamp timber harvest plants. If we were going to stop the logging, the citizens needed to rise up with factual data to prove that the plan was not only a bad idea, but it was illegal. And Google Earth was our secret weapon. Like David and Goliath, Google Earth was our slingshot.So it was literally as I was starting at Google that I looked at that and said, you know what? In order to understand that better, I want to remap it on Google Earth in the full 3D satellite imagery with the terrain so we can actually see what's at stake.Now, I didn't know, maybe it wasn't anything to worry about. Maybe it was no big deal. But then when I did remap, and there it is above there, right, in the red? It was like, oh my God. It's six miles long, it's 1,000 acres, the logging's going to go right up to the preschool, the daycare center, the churches. The helicopters are going to be carrying logs over the elementary school in perpetuity. The land was so steep, it's a drinking watershed for 100,000 people in Silicon Valley, it's where we get our water. It's very well known that logging in steep slopes in watersheds causes sedimentation that harms water. And so many government-managed watersheds disallow logging in drinking watersheds. But this is privately owned, so they put in the proposal.I made the visualization over the weekend. This is now September 2005, like two months after Google Earth had come out. We had this packed schoolroom -- everyone was wondering, should we be worried or not? People were literally outside looking in the windows, it was so packed.I said, \"Look, there's this new thing, Google Earth. I put the data, the plan in Google Earth. So I'll show you…” and the visual starts in outer space and flies in. Now it's almost a cliché, but then it had never been done before. So it flies in, I turn on the plan, and everyone is shocked, right? There's this gasp in the room. Oh, my God, that's what they're going to do? Yeah, that's what they're going to do.So then we spent 20 minutes. People are like, \"Go here, go there, let me see my house, oh my God.\" People got so much more of a perspective. Some of them said later, that motivated us to get organized, because now we really understood what was proposed. Seeing was believing. And that became a theme of Google Earth Outreach, which is really showing people what's at stake in a way they can understand in a second, as opposed to giving them charts and graphs or crummy maps that they don't understand.Do you have any unique hobbies or ways that you spend your downtime that many people don't do?My unusual hobby is making trails, building trails in the mountains in my community. We now have a 1-mile loop, a 3-mile loop, a 5-mile loop, they’re all communally created.First I look in Google Earth so that I can get the lay of the land digitally before we go out. I understand where it's steep, there's a creek and a waterfall by us. Then I go out and wander. There's an aesthetic about making a trail. You don't want to make it too steep, you want nice landmarks along the way. Like, within a mile, let's get to the waterfall, and then let's have the good-view spot.I would buy these little flags you can get from a hardware store, a tiny little metal stake with a little flag on it, and I would go and flag a route. Then I would go re-walk it and keep moving the flags around until it felt right.When I was a mountaineer, I used to bushwhack all the time. I would never go on trails -- trails were for ordinary people. So we would go cross-country. You would just use map and compass and navigate off landmarks. I learned that at National Outdoor Leadership School, which I did when I was 20.So you learn to navigate with map, compass and not to rely on trails. So I developed a taste for going cross-country. And even to this day, I like to go. I like to just look at a map and study it and go, \"You know, I bet that would be an interesting place to go, even though Yosemite didn't make an official trail there.\" And there are some beautiful places in the backcountry, by the way, where trails don’t take you.So I keep walking until I have it just the way I want it, and then I get help. The guys who actually take the pickaxe and carve the trail. I have help for that part.There's an aesthetic for a trail. There are trail-building books that say, like, you don't want to have more than a 10 percent incline on a trail, because if it's more than 10 percent, you'll get erosion in a heavy rain, for example. And the way that it tilts when you're on a slope is important, because if you do it wrong, the trail washes out. When you make a switchback, it's good to make a switchback around something like a boulder or a tree. There's actually an art and a science to making a trail that's fun.For people who love hiking but aren't used to off-trail or backcountry, what's a good first step?I think it's good to go with someone who's done it, because I would hate to be responsible for somebody getting lost, and we never hear from them again. And that's quite possible.I've gotten lost many times. And I've learned a lot from that. But I had compass, map, I had the skills to get myself found again.Actually, with GPS now, if people take a GPS device, it's almost cheating now, because it's hard to get lost now with the GPS. But I will say, for people in California, the Sierras have a lot of beautiful areas that even guide books will tell you this is a little bit of an off-trail thing, but it's not hard. There will be a trail that takes you into an area of lakes, and then there's a side unofficial little canyon to go up to it, whatever. That's a nice way to start.We often ask people about the families they've formed. Do you have children?No, I don't. I have two dogs. And nieces and nephews. But no kids.Was that a conscious decision?Yeah. Some people can do everything. I don't think I'm one of those people. I felt from my very early consciousness that I was here to do something. It took me a while to figure it out. It took me until that dark night of the soul, after my father and brother died, that I finally was determined to figure it out. And I did. This is why I'm here. This is why I was put on earth, to do this work. And I feel so fortunate to have done that. I just felt like I couldn't do that and have kids. Other people may be able to. More power to them.What are some books that had a significant impact on you and your intellectual development?I don't know if this totally answers your question, but when I was a kid, I loved The Phantom Tollbooth. That was the first book that I remember really saying, this book is for me. This book speaks to me. I used to read voraciously when I was a kid. But that book -- Dictionopolis, Digitopolis, you know, the abstractions of numbers and words, and it was so creative. Anyway, it was fantastic.This is very wonky, but there were also books like -- I won't go into the wonkiest book -- but there was a really cool book called On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson. It's about math and nature, and how you could find math everywhere if you know what to look for. So the Fibonacci series shows up in the way leaves grow along the stem of a plant, or the equiangular spiral shows up in the nautilus shell. There's math in the way an abalone shell adds on a new layer every year. There are beautiful mathematics in nature. This book was just a classic treatise on that. I loved that because I love math and I love nature. And someone who put the two together was very beautiful to me.That book is probably an acquired taste. Then I guess I would just mention my friend Victoria Sweet's book, God's Hotel, which is about the last Almshouse in America. She's a physician, practiced for 20 years at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco.What was moving for me is, I was like her first reader. As she wrote each chapter, she would give it to me, and I would critique it. I kind of watched this book turn into a book. That was fascinating, and it's a beautiful, beautiful book, God's Hotel. I highly recommend.You said you weren’t going to mention the wonkiest book you loved -- what was it?Gödel, Escher, Bach. I read that book like four times. I just loved the weaving together of music and art and math and computer science. If you squint your eyes, it's all the same thing. If you look in a certain way, you can see them all as different expressions of the some same underlying... I can't explain it.I really love abstraction. I love people who see things very deeply and see beyond what other people see, and they make surprising connections. Again, like nature and math, I just love that. It's very stimulating for me.You were a voracious reader as a youngster. So many parents want to instill that love in their children. Do you recall what led you down that path?Everyone in my family was a reader. We were very funny -- like if you look at us after Thanksgiving dinner, someone's pulled out an encyclopedia, someone's pulled out a dictionary, someone's got three crossword puzzles, and we're all just challenging each other. That was our life. We ordered two copies of The New York Times so that we wouldn't fight over it.I think there was a love of knowledge, a love of good writing. My mother and my father, they both exposed us to a lot of things. I don't claim any of this is profound, but we all had piano lessons.The best thing for me was we spent every summer in the Adirondacks. My grandfather bought a house on a lake that my family still has. Now it's come to my generation, so my cousins and siblings and I all own it. We're going to try to keep passing it down through the family. It's going to get more and more complicated. It's a huge house on 50 acres. I took my entire team there last summer. It's called Indian Lake in the Adirondacks.When my friends would go to camp, I would go to Grandpa's house in Indian Lake. Our days were completely unstructured, we'd spend the whole summer, we'd just wander in the woods and were identifying mushrooms and flowers, and swimming. I hope more kids have that, because I feel like my greatest source of serenity is nature. You can't beat nature.Is there a travel journey that you've taken that you would recommend to others?I really love Alaska. I climbed Denali. In 1990 I led a team to the top of Denali. And that took a month. It was 28 days up, two days down. We did our own route. We did an unusual route. But along the way, it's caribou and wolves and grizzly bears and Dall sheep and moose. Anybody can go to Denali National Park. Just incredible wildlife. And also just the people that we met. You can still homestead up there. It's crazy, right?So I've gone back two or three times. In September the tundra's changing color, and you can get Northern Lights. I've seen grizzly cubs learning to catch salmon for the first time. That was very instructional for me, because the mother takes care of the cubs for two seasons, and then they're on their own, because she's going to have the next litter, or whatever they call it. They have to learn how to take care of themselves, or they're going to die.This was the second season for these two cub siblings with their mom. And I was with this guide, and they were a little worried, because this one little cub -- and this is like a metaphor for me -- would see a salmon -- and they're shiny and glittery -- and would like grab it and would be just about to bite it, but then would see another one, and would drop this one and grab another one, right? It was literally that grabbing for the shiny things. They said, she needs to eat more.Anyway, it's just wild and beautiful and very different from the lower 48. I've gone to a lot of other places in the world, but I don't know, there's something about Alaska.Is there an emotional arc to climbing a mountain that would surprise people?It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. There's nothing like it. I climb in the Himalayas also. We were the first women to climb this 22,000-foot peak in the Himalayas. For Denali, we trained for a year. Many people don't succeed. Four people died on it the year that we did it.But I think it forged my character. Mountaineering forged my character. I learned so much about myself, and how I deal with fear, and setting goals and overcoming obstacles and working as a team. When we climbed Denali, for a month, I was roped to three other people. We were never more than 20 feet away from each other for a month. Right? So if someone has an annoying habit, it really gets annoying.There's just tremendous, tremendous physical satisfaction. I think mountaintops are some of the most spiritual places on the planet. Many mountains are actually sacred to local people. There's a mountain Machapuchare in the Himalayas that hopefully no one has ever stood on top of, because it's so sacred that locals have asked mountaineers to stop just short of the summit so they don't desecrate the summit, because this is the abode of the gods. And you feel that.It's also given me a perspective, because on my expedition in the Himalayas, someone died. When I was in the Denali, four people died. So when I'm here at Google, and people are stressing about something -- \"Oh, my God, they're reorganizing,\" or whatever -- I'm like, \"Look, nobody's going to die. We're not falling into crevasses here. Let's have some perspective.\"I also learned a lot of leadership skills there. I don't think I was a natural leader. I was very introverted as a kid, painfully shy. I was painfully shy. And my team here at Google can't believe that today, because I'm public-speaking.The only way I got over that hurdle of being able to speak in public was when I stopped focusing on myself and worrying about my nose is going to be running, and I'm going to have a heart attack and die on the stage. When I said: No, don't think about yourself. Think about the work. Think about the message. Do you want people to know that message? Well, yes, I do. That's your job, to deliver that. It's not about you. It's about that.I still have to remind myself of that when I get nervous, that it's not about me, it's about what we're trying to accomplish as a team. That helps me be less nervous.So I learned. I made a lot of mistakes, but I learned -- for example, there was a Canadian mountaineering guide who wrote a book that influenced me. Conrad Kain, he guided people for decades in the Canadian Rockies. He had these rules for the leader, if you are leading a team in the mountains. You're the leader, you're the guide. These people are entrusting their lives in your care.First rule: Show no fear. No matter what happens. And I still do that today. As a leader, your job is to be brave in the face of whatever it is, to have confidence that you will overcome that.The second rule: Always pay most attention to the weakest member of the party. Right? You're on a rope together. If there's one person who's tired or sick or whatever's going on, they could be why you all get killed. I still pay attention to that. The whole forward movement of the project of whatever you're doing doesn't just depend upon the strongest contributors. It also depends upon making sure the weakest are not left behind. You help develop them or bring them along or whatever.And the third rule… I don't remember. [laughter] Sorry.But this reminds me, one more thing. After my brother Frank Moore died, I was his executor. I'm going through his desk and I found this quote (sometimes attributed to Goethe): \"Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness.” And it goes on: “The moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves, too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.\"When I saw that -- and that was like his top thing in his drawer -- I was like, okay. That was that period in my life where I was kind of equivocating. What am I going to do and how am I going to make a difference?And what I take from this is: just commit, even if you're not sure. And even when you climb a mountain, sometimes you don't actually see the summit from where you are, but you know if you head in a positive direction, eventually you will see the summit.I found that I used to be a perfectionist. I used to think there was only one right answer to things, and I just needed to figure it out. Like, what grad school am I supposed to go to? I got into different grad schools. Which one is the right one? I would be just paralyzed with what's the right answer.Or then I went to Stanford, I'm like, Who do I want to be my advisor? I was a mess -- “this guy would be good for this, and that guy would be better for…” -- I can't decide, I can't decide, I can't decide. I always thought there was one right answer.Then a friend said to me, \"Throw the I Ching.\" Do you know the I Ching? It's the Chinese Book of Changes. There are 64 hexagrams. Each one has a sort of message. You want to do something that generates a number between one and 64. So you can throw six coins, two to the sixth equals 64, or people do something with sticks or whatever.Anyway, you do something that gives you a number between one and 64. So she said, \"You ask a question, and then you throw the I Ching and see what you get.\" This is kind of woo-woo, right? But I did it. I was like, \"Should I have this professor or that professor be my advisor? Tell me the answer.\" I threw the I Ching, and the answer was, “Everything furthers.”That message has been something that I hold. Whenever I think, Should I do this or do that? I'm reminded: That's a false choice. There's not just one right answer. Either of those professors would have been great to work with. I would learn different things. But either of them would be great.And so suddenly I just relaxed, and I made the decision, and I went forward. That's something I do believe, I hold to be true. It's not useful to be paralyzed by indecision. Sometimes the best thing is just make a choice, commit, go forward and be attentive and mindful to what's happening along the way, and be prepared to make mid-course corrections. Don't get hung up on having to figure out the right answer before making a move.Do you keep a journal or do anything else to maintain your memories?I used to. I don't right now. I have found there have been times where I was dreaming a lot. I think it's important when you're dreaming to try to write down your dreams. Because when I've had times of crisis, where I was in between and I was struggling, I think your subconscious has a lot of guidance for you and it comes out in your dreams. You have to write them down immediately when you wake up, because otherwise you forget them. You write it down and look at it, and then suddenly you get insights from it.Let me ask about mapping technology. What are some of the new frontiers in your line of work?When I first started here, it was all about using Google Earth and Google Maps to give people a perspective on a place. We work with more than 6,000 nonprofits now that are using Google Earth to take everyone on the world on a virtual guided tour to a place on the planet that may be under threat.So, you hear about deforestation in the Amazon, or there's genocide in Darfur and they're burning villages, or icecaps are melting, or they’re doing mountaintop-removal coal mining in Appalachia. You hear this stuff, and it seems very abstract. Often this is happening in remote places where people are not on the ground.But these organizations now -- and we're helping them -- are using Google Earth as a new kind of storytelling tool, where you can take people there virtually and show them the issues and also show them alternative future scenarios.So Appalachian Voices said, \"Okay, we could blow up these five mountains that have permits on them right now, and then they'll look like that.\" They could also show already horrendously dynamited mountains, which never grow back, by the way. \"Or we could put windmills on them that would look like this.\" They got commercially available windmills -- and they modeled them in 3D and put them in -- and it would look like this. Within two years, they would have produced enough power that compensated for what they would have gotten from one time blowing up the mountains, and from then on, it's additional energy.I think of that as the first era of our digital mapping work. The next phase that's going on right now is: It's not enough just to see it. You need to be able to analyze and measure and map and monitor what's happening in these places. There's enormous amounts of information -- for example, satellite imagery and weather data and so on -- that's collected every day. If you have the right computing power and analytical methods, you can actually determine and measure what's happening, like measure deforestation.You can predict a likelihood of future malaria outbreaks six of eight weeks in advance by looking at the rainfall here, the temperature here, the distance from population centers, the distance from rivers. How is the landscape greening up? You can predict mosquito hatches, and you can then say, \"Okay, we should target interventions for this place at that time,\" whether it's bed nets or inoculation or whatever.We're entering that era now, and this is the second hat that I wear. The first hat is Google Earth Outreach. The second one is Google Earth Engine, where we've built this amazing technology, this environmental analysis engine for the planet. While we're sitting here, it's getting feeds of satellite imagery and the weather data and so on. We've got more than 4,000 scientists now that are putting their models in to detect deforestation or risk of emerging infectious disease or mapping water resources or estimating crop yield, predicting drought.It's big data. That's why it hasn't happened before. Because to really manage all these feeds of satellite data and then do science on it, do an analysis, it's petabytes of data, which is so much that people don't even know what that word is.But we have a lot of computers at Google that are running YouTube and Search and everything else. Well, now they're running Google Earth Engine, and they're doing this near real-time environmental analysis so we can really understand what's happening on the planet.One example is we worked with Professor Matt Hansen at the University of Maryland to create the first detailed map of global forest and deforestation from 2000 to 2012. We published that in Science. There'd never been a detailed map before. And it ended up we analyzed almost 700,000 satellite images. We ran it on 10,000 computers in parallel. We had that map result in a couple of days, whereas on a single computer, it would have taken more than 15 years.Now it's being applied to all these other things. The dream is that we're building a living, breathing dashboard of the planet. There are a lot of decisions that are being made about how we extract natural resources -- whether it's logging or mining or water, where we put dams -- there are a lot of these decisions that are not being made with the right information.

The chemical adds to the buildup of smog, which is tied to asthma and other respiratory illnesses; but its effects are different from compounds that directly cause warming of the atmosphere.In a statement, Winterkorn said that “I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,” and ordered an external investigation.This was equivalent to putting his finger in a bursting dam, given that the German company could face penalties of up to $18 billion for allegedly installing the illegal “defeat devices” to falsify emissions tests. Volkswagen shares plummeted on the Frankfurt DAX index in response to the news.Apart from saving the reputation of his company, Winterkorn should also think about the damage he has done to the corporate sustainability movement. Volkswagen’s actions will fuel the cynics who believe businesses are just paying lip service when it comes to issues like climate change and resource scarcity.This is a particularly poignant moment for such reflection, given scores of companies are converging on New York over the next few days to join Volkswagen in making commitments during Climate Week to creating a low-carbon economy.What the Volkswagen scandal illustrates is that profit maximization is so deeply embedded in corporate culture that when push comes to shove, the vast majority of companies will put the bottom line above any moral case for change, and sometimes even cheat to keep the short-term profits coming in.The only way this is going to change is if companies create a revolution in the way that staff are incentivized. If businesses really believe climate change is a serious issue, they need to stop paying their staff purely on the basis of meeting their quarterly targets.It is true that a small but growing number of companies are starting to incorporate sustainability performance into their executive compensation packages, but these often represent a tiny percentage of overall pay and therefore are unlikely to change behavior.Research by Wayne Guay, professor of accounting at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, found that for those companies that do incorporate sustainability targets, this normally makes up less than 1 percent of overall pay.A study by Ceres, a nonprofit focused on sustainable business and climate action, found that in 613 of the nation's largest publicly traded companies, fewer than a third had boards of directors formally overseeing sustainability performance. And just 19 companies, or 3 percent, related compensation directly to voluntary sustainability performance targets such as greenhouse gas emissions reductions.Ceres points to Alcoa, one of the world's largest producers of aluminum, as a leader in the field. A fifth of Alcoa's executive cash compensation is tied to safety, diversity goals and environmental stewardship, including greenhouse gas reductions and energy efficiency.Our current form of capitalism has been around long enough for us to know the simple truth that people will act in accordance with how you assess their performance. If Volkswagen had spent the necessary time and energy to drive sustainability deep into the corporate culture, and linked this in a significant way to executive performance, it may have avoided the disaster it now faces.Other companies looking on would also do well to note that as we move into a more carbon-constrained era, they ignore climate change at their peril.Do you work for VW or own a VW? We'd like to hear from you.

As I recount in The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars ('HSCW'), I found myself at the center of those attacks because of the iconic Hockey Stick graph my co-authors and I published back in the late 1990s. The graph highlighted, in an easily understandable way, the unprecedented nature of modern global warming. As a result, it proved greatly inconvenient for vested interests, like ExxonMobil, who are opposed to regulation of carbon emissions -- from the burning of fossil fuels -- that are behind the warming of the globe and the associated changes in climate.Two Exxon scientists measuring carbon dioxide levels as part of a project that ran from 1979 to 1982. (Credit: Richard Werthamer) [Source: Inside Climate News].The parallels with the tobacco industry, which knew about -- and hid from the public -- the health dangers of cigarette smoking, are staggering. Indeed, the industry-funded climate change denial campaign, as I discuss in HSCW, has its roots in the earlier tobacco industry disinformation campaign.In their blockbuster new article, Inside Climate News ('ICN') details how key senior Exxon scientists had warned top executives about the reality and threat of continued fossil fuel burning and the associated warming of the planet and changes in climate \"well before most of the world had heard of the looming climate crisis.\" They describe a rather prescient presentation made by one of Exxon's senior scientists as far back as July 1977:At a meeting in Exxon Corporation's headquarters, a senior company scientist named James F. Black addressed an audience of powerful oilmen. Speaking without a text as he flipped through detailed slides, Black delivered a sobering message: carbon dioxide from the world's use of fossil fuels would warm the planet and could eventually endanger humanity.ExxonMobil, we learn from ICN, chose as a result to fund an internal research effort over the next few years to assess the threat posed by climate change:Exxon budgeted more than $1 million over three years for the tanker project to measure how quickly the oceans were taking in CO2. It was a small fraction of Exxon Research's annual $300 million budget, but the question the scientists tackled was one of the biggest uncertainties in climate science: how quickly could the deep oceans absorb atmospheric CO2? If Exxon could pinpoint the answer, it would know how long it had before CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere could force a transition away from fossil fuels.They even worked closely with outside climate researchers, ultimately reaching the conclusion that the potential threat was indeed great (emphasis added):Exxon also hired scientists and mathematicians to develop better climate models and publish research results in peer-reviewed journals. By 1982, the company's own scientists, collaborating with outside researchers, created rigorous climate models - computer programs that simulate the workings of the climate to assess the impact of emissions on global temperatures. They confirmed an emerging scientific consensus that warming could be even worse than Black had warned five years earlier.ExxonMobil executives were informed in no uncertain terms, by their own science division, that climate change impacts could be \"catastrophic\" and potentially \"irreversible\" unless there were major reductions in fossil fuel burning:Exxon's research laid the groundwork for a 1982 corporate primer on carbon dioxide and climate change prepared by its environmental affairs office. Marked \"not to be distributed externally,\" it contained information that \"has been given wide circulation to Exxon management.\" In it, the company recognized, despite the many lingering unknowns, that heading off global warming \"would require major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.\"ExxonMobil scientists, furthermore, recognized that the company had an ethical obligation to come forward with what they had learned. Staff scientist Roger Cohen stated as much in a September 1982 memo described by ICN:He warned that publication of the company's conclusions might attract media attention because of the \"connection between Exxon's major business and the role of fossil fuel combustion in contributing to the increase of atmospheric CO2.\"A good faith effort on their part to acknowledge and communicate the scientific basis and the risks involved would, their own researchers argued, grant them legitimacy when it comes to the honest debate that is to be had about policy prescriptions for dealing with the climate change problem. According to ICN:In the early 1980s Exxon researchers often repeated that unbiased science would give it legitimacy in helping shape climate-related laws that would affect its profitability.So let's be clear. ExxonMobil chief executives could have heeded that advice. They could have gone down in history as heroes who helped save the planet from the ravages of climate change.But that was not to be.ICN quotes me at the end of the article:Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, who has been a frequent target of climate deniers, said that inaction, just like actions, have consequences. When he recently spoke to InsideClimate News, he was unaware of this chapter in Exxon's history.Economic pressures, ICN notes, led Exxon to dissolve their climate research division by the late 1980s. In his famous July 1988 congressional testimony, NASA scientist James Hansen had meanwhile announced to the world that human-caused climate change had arrived, and that the cause was the burning of fossil fuels. ExxonMobil had to make a decision: would they choose to be part of the solution, or part of the problem? ICN lays out the answer for us:Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition, an alliance of some of the world's largest companies seeking to halt government efforts to curb fossil fuel emissions. Exxon used the American Petroleum Institute, right-wing think tanks, campaign contributions and its own lobbying to push a narrative that climate science was too uncertain to necessitate cuts in fossil fuel emissions.Perhaps nothing better conveys the dramatic shift in ExxonMobil's attitude toward climate change than the subsequent activities of the aforementioned staff scientist Roger Cohen, who had once warned of the potentially \"catastrophic\" future impacts of climate change and had expressed concern about the implications for Exxon's \"honesty and integrity\" were it not to come forward with it's knowledge that human-caused climate change is real and a threat. You see,  Cohen went on to work for industry front groups like the George C. Marshall Institute that advocate for fossil fuel interests like Exxon by denying the reality and threat of climate change. Austin is one of a small fringe group of scientists who sought to sabotage the American Physical Society's position statement affirming the science of human-caused climate change. One is reminded of the famous Upton Sinclair quote \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\"One might think that the latest revelations about ExxonMobil and their tobaccoesque decades-long effort to hide the findings of their own scientists, would end climate change denialism for good. If you're a hardcore climate change denier, after all, it must be rather demoralizing to learn that ExxonMobil's own scientists expressed contempt for your views behind your back. If you've lost ExxonMobil's own scientists, you've lost the scientific debate.But let's remember that climate change denial isn't actually about the science. That was settled long ago -- including by Exxon's own scientists no less. Climate change denial is about opposition to regulation. It is about science-denying front groups, industry shills, bought-and-sold politicians, and other bad faith actors who continue to provide cover for corporate polluters like ExxonMobil by fooling the public.By any reasonable measure, just about every conceivable climate change denier talking point had been shot down by 2007 (and arguably much earlier). As I explained in chapter 12 (\"Heads of the Hydra\") of HSCW:The complete or near collapse by 2007 of the pillars of defensible climate change skepticism represented a critical juncture in the debate over the science. Would climate change contrarians throw in the towel and at least concede the reality of human-caused climate change? Would they engage constructively in the discourse, focusing their efforts on the legitimate remaining uncertainties, such as the uncertain nature of climate change projections and the worthy debate to be had regarding what to do about the problem? Or would they retrench and continue to contest the ever-accumulating evidence supporting the reality of the climate change problem? The question is of course rhetorical; we already know the answer.As we know, of course, the climate change disinformation campaign simply ratcheted the denial machine up a notch. Attack dogs doubled down in their campaign of denial and deceit, and so we soon got the ironically-termed 'climategate' campaign, wherein climate scientists emails were stolen, combed through, cherry-picked, and misrepresented through out of context quotations in an effort to call the scientific evidence for climate change into question on the eve of the December 2009 Copenhagen climate summit (read chapter 14, \"Climategate: The Real Story\" of HSCW for further details).The irony, of course, is that rather than uncovering any wrongdoing or indiscretion by climate scientists, the 'climategate' affair simply revealed that climate change deniers were now more than willing to engage in criminal behavior in their efforts to misrepresent the science and scientists and deceive the public. Like Watergate before it, the real scandal was the criminal theft, not the content of the stolen materials -- a fact that was oddly lost on many media organizations who readily bought into the denialist framing of the matter. As I note in the epilogue of HSCW:While the campaign did have the immediate impact of casting doubt over climate science, it also marked a critical juncture, and indeed potentially a turning point, in the climate change debate. Perhaps \"climategate\" was the moment when the climate change denial movement conceded the legitimate debate, choosing instead to double down on smear and disinformation, a tacit acceptance that an honest, science-based case for denying the reality of human-caused climate change and the threat it presents could no longer be made. Maybe it was the moment when the seamy underbelly of the climate change denial movement became exposed for all to see.So one might well wonder as we head toward the critical December 2015 climate summit in Paris, have the latest revelations about ExxonMobil caused climate change deniers to see the light, to reconsider their position? And one might well suspect the answer...Since the ExxonMobil story broke, the \"merchants of doubt\" have instead engaged in a campaign of misdirection, presumably hoping they can distract the public and policymakers from the stunning new revelations. Among other things, we have seen these events unfold in the few days since the story broke:1. The right-wing Canadian newspaper National Post engaged in a reprehensible personal attack against climate advocate Naomi Klein and her opposition to mining the Canadian tar sands (something James Hansen has warned would be \"game over for the climate\"). The piece included a false and libelous allegation of \"fraud\" against yours truly. It is worth noting that the National Post has previously lost a defamation suit brought by a climate scientist. It is also worth noting that the columnist who penned the piece, Conrad Black, is best known for having served a prison term for actually committing fraud. Chalk one up for chutzpah.2. Conservative commentator George Will, known for his serial distortions when it comes to the matter of climate change, has attacked Pope Francis for his efforts to raise awareness about the threat of climate change. Though Will's commentary is filled with half-truths, falsehoods, and innuendo, what is most cynical and pernicious about the piece is the pretense of concern that acting on climate change \"would devastate the poor\" when precisely the opposite is known to be true.3. Professional climate smearmonger Marc Morano joined with Koch Brothers-funded attack dog John Hinderaker and others in the conservative media and blogosphere accusing climate scientists of wanting to \"arrest climate skeptics\". As with just about anything that comes out of the climate denialosphere, the allegation is of course completely untruthful. The reality is that a small group of climate scientists recently suggested that the department of justice investigate the possibility that certain fossil fuel companies (not individuals) might be subject to civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\"RICO\") charges. Civil RICO seeks the payment of fines (not imprisonment of any individuals) by corporate entities that knowingly hid the damages done by their product. That is precisely what happened with big tobacco, and the same Department of Justice lawyer who successfully brought a civil RICO suit against tobacco companies more than a decade ago has recently argued that Exxon and other fossil fuel companies might suffer similar liability given the latest revelations over what they knew about the dangers of climate change, and when they knew it.As the curtain continues to be lifted on the climate change denial machine and its deceitful tactics, we must assume that the smears and distortions will simply grow more desperate, the misdirection and distraction more brazen. Expect the worst as the 2015 Paris climate summit -- potentially the last opportunity to reach an international agreement that will stave off dangerous and irreversible changes in climate -- approaches. Bad faith actors have shown they will do anything they can -- including engaging in criminal actions -- in their efforts to sabotage global agreements aimed at limiting carbon emissions.Let's not allow their cynical efforts to be successful. Call out climate change disinformation when you encounter it, and do what you can to correct the record. Explain to your family, friends, coworkers and classmates the importance of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations below dangerous levels. And most of all, keep your eye on the prize -- a binding international treaty to reduce carbon emissions later this year in Paris.__________Michael Mann is Distinguished Professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University and author of The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines and the recently updated and expanded Dire Predictions: Understanding Climate Change."}, {"title": "Volkswagen's Shame and Challenge to Sustainability Management", "text": "In an amazing and brazen attempt to avoid compliance with our air pollution rules, Volkswagen installed a piece of software that allowed their diesel-powered automobiles to circumvent air quality regulation. In a recent article, Coral Davenport and Jack Ewing of the New York Times reported that:The Environmental Protection Agency accused the German automaker of using software to detect when the car is undergoing its periodic state emissions testing. Only during such tests are the cars' full emissions control systems turned on. During normal driving situations, the controls are turned off, allowing the cars to spew as much as 40 times as much pollution as allowed under the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. said.The hero in this story is the International Council on Clean Transportation who found a large gap between pollutants emitted in the lab and emissions detected on the road. They reported this to EPA, which led to the investigation, Volkswagen's (VW) confession, and the recall of about a half a million cars. VW owners may not be happy with the performance of their cars once the pollution control devices are restored because these vehicles lose a lot of pick-up when pollution controls are engaged. In all likelihood, many owners will not comply with the recall order and state-managed emission inspections will continue to be fooled.It is not difficult to understand why auto company management might attempt to circumvent the law this way. There is always pressure to sell cars, and an automobile's pick-up is more visible to a buyer than the emission of pollutants from its tailpipe. It looked like the perfect crime: just design a piece of software that recognized an emission testing process and turns the device on during the test and off when the test is over.The issue for Volkswagen is the depth of this corrupt attitude in its corporate culture. I imagine corporate management somehow felt justified in taking this action. They may have understood that the health impact of air pollution is real and important, but that it would be difficult to assign causality to one source of pollution. It is true that VW's deception was hard to detect and it's even more difficult to point to the specific harm caused by this deceit. But what if the same willingness to take shortcuts and deceive extends to safety equipment like seat belts and airbags? How about the car's brakes? If a car manufacturer is dishonest in one area, what's to keep them from being dishonest in other areas?The issue for Volkswagen is not simply how do they comply with EPA's order, but what do they do to eliminate the cause of this deception within their organization? The auto industry has a long history of resistance and at best, grudging compliance with environmental and safety rules. The car companies complained about seat belts and said that requiring them would harm their business. They complained about the catalytic converter. They continue to complain about gas mileage standards. It is ironic that this crime was detected at the same time that Volkswagen was announcing a major increase in their production of electric and hybrid automobiles. It is clear that one part of the company understands the commercial potential of sustainable personal transportation--but clearly another part of VW could care less.The effort to delegitimize and avoid compliance with government regulation has a long history in American politics. The American Revolution itself and the national creation myths it inspired tend to glorify clever efforts at averting the law. While I know of no similar current in German political culture, perhaps there is another explanation for this blatant disregard for the rule of law.If we are going to develop a sustainable economy with a high level of production while maintaining the planet's ecological health, we need to get better at setting and complying with environmental rules. We no longer live on the frontier or in the Wild West. With over seven billion people on the planet, we need to learn to be more thoughtful about how we produce and consume the material resources we need. Air pollution rules are not optional because breathing is not optional.The people who disconnect their air pollution devices should know they are trading off lung disease for a little bit of pick-up in their vehicle. Let's personalize it: If it was your child that might get sick, would you do it? But even more than the specifics of this case, we need to think hard about the underlying values and attitudes that lead to this anti-social behavior. On a more crowded planet we need to be more aware of the impact of our actions. We need to do a better job of projecting the impact of our actions on our neighbors and on our planet. We need to work hard to reduce negative impacts.Volkswagen's behavior helps me understand the mindset that animates the Republican race for the presidency. As I watch the unfolding spectacle of the Republican presidential nomination contest I am constantly reminded of the dynamic of the paradigm shift now underway toward sustainability. While the renewable economy is growing, the crowd on the Republican debate platform doesn't seem to get it. While it's true that few real issues are emerging in this campaign, the environment is conspicuously ignored. It's not simply climate change that is ignored but the overall issue of the planet's long-term well-being.If we begin 2017 with a Republican president and Congress it may be difficult to prevent a rollback of federal environmental and energy policies. It is clear that the part of the American public that will participate in the Republican nomination process thinks government is hopeless and would shut down the national government if they thought they could. Given the need for government to play an active role in the transition to a sustainable economy, this very vocal minority of the American public could slow the transition that has already begun.Despite the dysfunctional politics in Washington, I don't think this transition can be slowed down. Let's remember that America is part of a global economy, and if we are not aggressive about sustainability we may find ourselves left behind and noncompetitive in the new businesses that emerge in renewable energy and recycled materials. It won't help our economy if other national governments fund infrastructure such as high-speed rail, electric vehicle charging stations and smart-grid construction, while our national government sits helplessly on the sidelines.A key element of sustainability is the business principle of sustainability management: the organizational practices that promote a renewable economy. Compare it to Total Quality Management (TQM). TQM is a technique used to reduce waste and improve quality in an organization's supply chain and production processes. Sustainability management is a way to reduce resource costs and the potential costs of environmental impacts caused by an organization's production and consumption. Volkswagen's deception should be seen as sloppy management. It opens the company up to significant fines. According to Coral Davenport and Jack Ewing:The Justice Department's investigation [of Volkswagen] could ultimately result in fines or penalties for the company. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, the Justice Department could impose fines of as much as $37,500 for each recalled vehicle, for a possible total penalty of as much as $18 billion.While a penalty of this size is probably unlikely, any penalty is bad for the bottom line and for the organization's reputation. Taken a few steps further, a modern sustainability manager would take care to ensure that any use of resources was fully thought through and all environmental impacts were minimized. The absence of concern for sustainability is an indicator that Volkswagen's level of management competence needs improvement. Perhaps this incident will stimulate the company to improve. At least the company seemed contrite. Over this past weekend Martin Winterkorn, Volkswagen's CEO, apologized for the company's misconduct. They also stopped sales of new and used cars with the deceptive software. Let's hope that Volkswagen sees this as more than a PR problem, but as a profound failure of management."}, {"title": "Shifting Gears on Climate Change", "text": "As world leaders gather this week in New York, the pressure is mounting to produce a new climate change agreement in Paris in December. The outcome of that meeting will set the stage for the global response to rising temperatures and ongoing environmental disruption. Rather than relying solely on national level leadership to foster change, we believe local governments and the private sector need to play a more central role in shaping the world's climate change action plan.The climate change conversation has begun to change. Until recently, the world focused its political efforts on pushing national government leaders to sign treaty commitments based on greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets. Setting goals is a start, but this top-down approach has failed to produce significant on-the-ground changes in behavior. The world community needs a new climate strategy. In this regard, we identify four ways to ramp-up the global climate change response at the Paris \"Conference of the Parties.\"First, we need to engage a wider array of actors to ensure a more robust response to climate change. Presidents and Prime Ministers do not have day-to-day control over the factors that determine a society's carbon footprint. In contrast, mayors, governors, and premiers often can enact policy changes and bring about meaningful action much more quickly than national leaders. Business also has a central role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. A strategy that embraces broader engagement thus needs to bring in CEOs as well as sub-national political leaders. To push cities, state/provinces, and private companies to undertake climate change action, their work must be measured, and their successes publicized.Second, we must expand the focus of our climate change agenda. Although \"mitigation\" strategies that reduce emissions will continue to be important, these efforts need to be matched with a new emphasis on adaptation. Developing countries, in particular, are already grappling with the early effects of a changing climate as shifts in rainfall patterns, increased intensity of hurricanes, and rising sea levels wreak havoc on traditional communities and livelihoods. For the world's most exposed people, a reduction in emissions in the industrialized world does little to address their pressing need for safety, resiliency, and economic progress.Much attention has been paid to financing the suite of actions the planet needs to take to avert catastrophic climactic harm. Much of that focus -- and a fair bit of political posturing -- has been devoted to assessing the appropriate financial role for countries seen as accountable for historic emissions. These are legitimate and complex issues. But, again, the results have been inadequate to the scale of the needs. We thus need a new climate finance strategy that uses limited public resources to leverage private capital. This argues for new structures - Green Banks, Green Bonds, and other creative finance mechanisms -- that can be directed to adaptation, energy efficiency, and the imperative of a transition to a clean energy future.Finally, we must broaden our efforts to reduce emissions. Until now, the policy focus has been aimed largely at the supply side. Expanding renewable energy and ending fossil fuel subsidies will continue to be important. But we ought to be paying much more attention to the demand side of the energy equation. Indeed, energy efficiency investments hold tremendous promise as a cost-effective element of the world's climate change mitigation program.The opportunities in both existing buildings and new construction are significant. With an estimated 40 percent of the world's energy consumption and 25 percent of total carbon emissions, buildings are ripe for transformation. In many industrialized nations, only 1 percent of existing buildings are renovated each year, meaning the vast majority of our structures deploy outdated lighting, heating, and ventilation technologies -- and thus consume far more energy than they need. Energy efficiency programs do exist, often as a function of productive partnerships among governments, utilities, and local businesses. But these efforts must be expanded and incentives developed that reward efficiency.As all eyes turn to Paris in December, the world community needs a reinvigorated climate change program. We believe that any new commitment to action must include broadened \"ownership\" of the climate change agenda and efforts to highlight progress particularly at the city, state/province, and corporate scales. Reframing of the challenge to include adaptation, demand-side energy management, and broader funding sources would also help to raise the trajectory of the global response to climate change. As illustrated by the positive response to the Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo's offer to host a Climate Summit for Local Leaders in Paris on December 4, mayors, governors, and other subnational leaders are ready to lead -- and the new Paris Climate Change Agreement should put them in a position to do so.Daniel C.

In Hungary and Croatia, volunteers have joined the humanitarian effort, including practical things like setting up a solar charging station in hot spots so that people can recharge their phones and access WiFi. In Greece, our office is in close contact with international relief NGOs ​to support their efforts ​and is working with local groups to collect and send relief packages to the Islands where many refugees are stranded.I want to personally thank all who are reaching out to help. In this moving ocean of solidarity, every drop matters. We must all join together and say loud and clear: #Refugeeswelcome!Tomorrow I travel to New York to attend the UN Summit on Sustainable Development Goals. My trip will be an easy one, but I will remember those times when my journeys, too, were journeys of fear. I will think of those facing days, months and years of relentless, life threatening journeys, with no guaranteed safety at the end of the road.As fellow human beings we owe it to them to raise our voices, to stand in solidarity and to address the root causes of global insecurity. We need to insist on finding real solutions - including getting off fossil fuels. Conflicts are always complex. But looking at current conflicts from Iraq, Ukraine, Sudan, the South China Sea to Nigeria it is clear that the access, the transport and thus the dependence on fossil fuels do play a role.\"Resource wars\" are not new. But today we can overcome them. In New York, I will argue for a world powered by 100% renewables for all by 2050. This world is in our grasp, our latest Energy Revolution scenario shows that without doubt. It is also the world we must choose if we want peace. Wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, insulation materials or double glazed windows are the \"weapons\" we must deploy to help create a safer world.I was lucky enough to see Apartheid ended by people power and international solidarity a few years after I was forced to leave South Africa. Apartheid was abolished, and I am now free to return. Will those displaced now ever have that privilege? I do not know.

His visit emboldened the non-violent resistance to the Soviet presence in Poland. A mere decade later, the Cold War was over, as people throughout Eastern Europe gained the courage to speak out against their governing regimes. The end of the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe had many causes, of course, but surely that early papal visit contributed significantly.Now, the United States is not Eastern Europe, and I do not expect a comparable level of social, political, and cultural upheaval to result from Pope Francis' visit. Still, the United States confronts some intractable problems of its own, and one can legitimately expect -- and hope -- to see lasting change occur as a result of the papal visit. And while we cannot guess whether Pope Francis intends to effect such changes, he is quite consciously preparing to address major issues that lie at the intersection of politics and morality.Perhaps the first area in which we might expect Pope Francis to challenge the reigning political paradigm is on the very question of what constitutes the intersection of politics and morality. Morality, in the American political context, is almost universally thought of as consisting principally of the range of sexual issues. In contrast, morality, for Pope Francis, is much more encompassing. It includes the ways in which strangers are welcomed, the climate is repaired, and money, markets, and capital are put in proper perspective.We should therefore look first to these three great themes, beginning with immigration as keys for understanding the papal visit. In the summer of 2013, just a few months after his election, Pope Francis traveled to the Island of Lampedusa, off the southern coast of Sicily. It is a scene of daily tragedy, where hundreds of bodies are routinely retrieved from the Mediterranean. Francis led the mourning for this great and needless loss of life, and dedicated his pontificate to welcoming the immigrant.As the middle eastern refugee crisis has grown to its present catastrophic proportions, Francis has pledged the Church's resources to ameliorate the conditions of the displaced. Every Catholic parish, he has urged, should attempt to house at least one refugee family. Religious orders, he has chided, must open their doors or lose their status as tax exempt organizations. He has opened the Vatican itself to refugees. And he has called on the nations of Europe to engage in concerted and productive action to resolve the immigration crisis.Now, Pope Francis is not naive or blind to the ugly nativism that is taking hold in the United States these last few months. I would expect him to address Americans with the same firmness he has Europeans. Catholics believe that Jesus is present in the destitute, in the marginalized, and in those forced by circumstance to seek refuge in distant lands. That is the meaning, after all, of Matthew 25: 38 (\"And when did we see thee a stranger and welcome thee, or naked and clothe thee?\"). Today's Christians must similarly see Jesus in the immigrants forced from their homelands and respond accordingly. We can only hope that by his words and gestures Pope Francis can break the xenophobic fever that now curses and blights American politics.There is little doubt also that Pope Francis will vigorously restate his case for concerted world action on climate change. Other popes have spoken out on the need to tend and care for our common planetary home. But Francis has moved far beyond his predecessors in the arguments he advanced in his encyclical Laudato Si. \"The climate is a common good,\" the Pope declared in this document, \"belonging to all and meant for all\" (para. 23).And if the climate belongs to everyone of us, then it is the common duty of humanity to safeguard and preserve it. Patiently and thoroughly, utilizing the latest scientific insights, Pope Francis built the case that the health of the world is genuinely at risk. \"Doomsday predictions,\" he solemnly reminded his readers, \"can no longer be met with irony or disdain\" (para. 161). The appropriate response to this crisis, Pope Francis teaches, is a rethinking of the very nature and function of politics (para. 197). Politics must abandon the trivial, it must cease being \"caught up in inconsequential discussions\" and it must become transnational in scope (para. 197).Pope Francis' address to the United Nations will surely reiterate these main themes. And in making his case before the world, he will equally surely take aim, at least indirectly, at a whole political movement dedicated to attacking the science on climate change as lacking foundation.This movement, located on the American right wing, is as ugly in its own right as the nativism that is also currently gripping the United States. It denounces science in the name of ideology. It is driven to extremes by a darkly paranoid and conspiracist view of the world. One can safely predict that we shall hear howls of protest from this segment of the body politic. One hopes that Pope Francis effectively discredits this way of seeing the world.We can also expect Pope Francis to challenge the primacy of capital. In Evangelii Gaudium, he denounced the \"idolatry of money.\" The worship of wealth, he proclaimed, denies \"the primacy of the human person\" (para. 55). It is in its own way a kind of dictatorship, and its harsh rule is especially visible in the growing gap between the very rich and the rest of humanity (para. 56).His critics loosely and glibly attack Pope Francis as a closet Marxist. That is certainly a slander and a falsehood. But he does call for a return to a more regulated economy, one in which the political order can exercise control over \"the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation\" (para. 56).Will Pope Francis echo these remarks during his visit to Capitol Hill? It is likely that he will. Will his comments have lasting effect? We can only hope so.That is not to say that Pope Francis will not strike other notes during his visit. It will be interesting to listen to what he says at the World Congress of Families, especially in light of his recent revision of the law governing marriage annulments. Conservative Catholics are mounting resistance to these much-needed law reforms, and I expect Pope Francis to stress to his audience that the divorced and remarried are not excommunicated from the Church and that they are as much an object of Jesus' love as anyone else.He is also visiting a prison during his stay in Philadelphia. Will he remind listeners of Jesus' words -- \"I was in prison and you visited me?\" The lepers of modern America are the inmates of our prison-industrial complex. They are isolated from the world, and housed in harsh conditions for impossibly long sentences. Certainly, Pope Francis will ensure that they feel included in the message of mercy which he is bringing the world.Of course, it must be emphasized that Pope Francis is not motivated by the same set of impulses that drive secular American politics. Though politicians will seek to claim his message as their own, Pope Francis is not taking sides in partisan debates. His is a loftier ambition -- to transform the world. The major premises of the message he is bringing to the United States is accordingly traditional and Christian: the requirement to show hospitality to all humankind; to be good stewards of the earth; and to serve God and not Mammon. That said, these are theological starting points that carry with them real political implications, and that is what I have been exploring here.So, will Pope Francis change America? Will his impact be as large as John Paul II's in Poland? We can only hope so."}, {"title": "Do These Cats Want A New Snail Friend Or Just Escargot?", "text": "Sometimes you just gotta relax and take things slo-o-ow.What better way to do that than with a blissed-out cat and a charming snail atop his paw?Unfortunately, a second feline seems intent on ruining the idyllic scene, sticking its face up against the snail and aggressively sniffing it.The Dodo suggests that viewers “pretend that these cats found a lonely snail and took him in to raise him as their own kittens,” but frankly it looks more to us like the cat is scoping out the snail as a potential snack.That being said, the calmer of the two cats appears to have a history of hanging out with snails.

Marco Rubio, who had previously said he didn't believe humans are causing climate change, now says he's not a skeptic. Rubio, a Catholic, has softened his stance somewhat since the pope's encyclical on the environment. During the debate, he focused his remarks on his dislike of the Obama administration's regulatory measures and argued that U.S. efforts to reduce emissions would do little to curb climate change because \"America is not a planet.\"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued there doesn't need to be a \"massive government intervention to deal with the problem\" of climate change. He also set up and knocked down a straw-man argument that there is \"some wild left-wing idea that somehow, us by ourselves is going to fix this problem.\"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took a similar approach, arguing that the administration's new climate rules would destroy the economy but \"will have a marginal impact on climate change.\"The other eight candidates on the main debate were spared from having to respond to the question -- which is probably good for Donald Trump, who apparently bases his climate change position on audience surveys.Sure, what Rubio, Christie and Walker offered are still problematic talking points. There's no \"left-wing idea\" that the U.S. should act alone. In fact, the U.S. is only now participating in an international effort to curb carbon emissions, an effort that Republican leaders have been working hard to undermine. And of course the U.S. acting alone would have only a marginal impact on climate change -- that's the whole point of working toward an international agreement.But the three candidates' statements on climate change do represent some modest degree of progress -- in words, if not in substance. They reflect movement along the continuum of climate change denial, a five-step process that environmental scientist Dana Nuccitelli elegantly described in The Guardian several years ago. The stages:I would amend that progression slightly, particularly in the American political context. Between steps 3 and 4, deniers here have added two more -- the \"I'm not a scientist\" step and the \"it's too expensive to do anything about it\" step.In 2014, the bulk of the Republican lawmakers appeared stuck in the \"not a scientist\" stage. The phrase was uttered so many times that it became a punch line for President Barack Obama. It is a creative turn of phrase, since it allows one to both evade stating an opinion about whether climate change is happening or what the cause may be, and also avoid stating whether it's a serious concern worthy of government action.This year, however, Republican presidential candidates seem to be moving ever so slowly into the next phase, somewhere between \"it's too expensive\" and \"even if we did something, it wouldn't matter anyway.\"The good news about those two stages is that they're relatively easy to counter with arguments that have nothing to do with one's understanding of science. The costs of not acting on climate change are mounting, as is the evidence that doing nothing is the most expensive option. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency projected costs of climate change for various aspects of the U.S. economy this century, including $7.4 billion for road maintenance and repairs and $3.1 billion due to rising sea levels and storm surges. But you don't have to listen to the hippies at the EPA. You can listen to a bunch of business leaders, economists and advisers to Ronald Reagan, or to the leaders of 13 of the world's largest energy companies, or to a group of House Republicans.So, too, is the impetus for world action increasing. China has agreed to begin cutting emissions in the near future, and is working collaboratively with U.S. partners on local efforts. More than 60 other countries have put forward their own individual pledges on greenhouse gases. The notion that the U.S. would be going it alone has never really been valid, but now it's even less so.The 2016 GOP contenders may still be a long way from advancing real solutions to the climate crisis. But at least the candidates who discussed it on Wednesday shed the most tired of all excuses for not acting: ignorance of the problem itself."}, {"title": "Baby Gorilla Died In Zoo, And Her Mother Just Can't Let Go", "text": "It is a heartrending scene."}, {"title": "Drunk Cowboy Avoids DWI By Hitching Ride With Horse: Cops", "text": "A Louisiana man avoided a DWI this week by getting a ride from the bar with a four-legged friend.Jake Williams was apprehended by law enforcement Tuesday while riding his horse, Sugar, down the side of a highway in the town of Watson, local news station WBRZ reported. Williams had earlier driven his truck, with Sugar riding in a horse trailer, to a daiquiri shop. But upon leaving the place, he apparently found himself too intoxicated to drive, according to the station.\"When you get a little too much to drink, why not ride a horse?\" he told WBRZ. “It’s safer that way. The horse knows the way home.\"Williams’ solution didn’t go as planned, however. Someone called the cops after noticing Williams leaving the bar on the horse. However, since Williams was not in a motorized vehicle, deputies could not charge him with a DWI and instead gave him a ticket for public intoxication.Whether or not an intoxicated horseback rider can receive a DUI or DWI charge varies from state to state. In 2012, for instance, a Florida man did receive a DUI charge -- along with an animal cruelty charge -- for allegedly riding a horse drunk. However, the state ultimately dropped those charges, and he pleaded no contest to the lesser charges of obstructing an officer without violence and interfering with railroad tracks or equipment.Even in places where riding a horse while intoxicated is technically legal, like Montana, it’s not a good idea, attorney Luke Berger noted in 2011.\"I wouldn't recommend that anyone does that,” he said.Berger was speaking in response to a PSA produced by the Montana Department of Transportation, which featured a horse stopping in front of a bar to pick up a rider.

Over time all ice on Earth will melt and cities like New York will be commited to the sea. Humankind has found other energy sources already, but coal, oil and gas are a gift to those who own them and as long as they can be sold for more than it costs to get them out the ground there is no economic brake for carbon emissions. We need to solve this problem. And for this, we might want to link the climate risk with its cause to incentivize company strategies that have a chance to survive.Long before it was born, humanity got this incredibly valuable present: fossil fuels. Oil, coal and gas are captured sunlight once collected by tiny algae and huge forests. Over time this fossilized solar energy sunk into Earth's depth. Not everyone got the same piece of the cake; some regions got more, some less. It took us a while to discover how to use this wealth, but its energy density was unprecedented, so much greater than that of wood. So it fueled our industrial evolution - it was a present that meant prosperity as well as cultural development.Yet in the meantime it has turned out to cause climate change and we are forced to think how to use solar power directly, without the carbon-detour. If emissions continue to rise linearly by 0.25 billion metric tons of carbon every year, we will have burned everything we found by the end of the next century. That sounds far away, but it is also an incredible amount of carbon. Once turned into CO2 and blown into the sky, a large part of it stays there for hundreds of years and even millennia. Already now, it causes changes of the Earth system that will last for thousands of years.Burn it all - melt it allLast week we showed in a study in Science Advances that if we do that, burn all the fossil fuels, we melt all the ice of Antarctica. Since Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth this means we would turn all the ice on the planet into liquid water and hence raise sea level worldwide higher than ever before in the history of humanity - let alone human civilization. That would reshape our coastlines and thereby change the face of our planet (see National Geographic maps for ice-free world). Cities like New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Calcutta, Hamburg, Jakarta, Cairo would be committed to the sea.Eliminating all ice on Antarctica would take thousands of years. That is even further away than the 200 years we need to burn all fossil fuels. And, understandably, possible changes in the far future are perceived as something we can ignore for now. But that is not true. As mind-blowing as it is: What we do now, within just a few decades, triggers changes that will be felt for thousands of years to come. We are setting the Earth system in motion and, on the way, destroy important parts of our cultural heritage.But not just that. Even though melting all ice on Earth will take long, the sea-level rise will be quick enough to pose a real challenge for us to adapt to: Already in the first few centuries of the great melting, sea levels will rise up to two feet every ten years (see graph). This is a lot. New York City is currently preparing for a sea-level rise of about four feet for the end of the century. More than two inches every year is faster than most administrative processes can handle.All this only happens if we do not stop emitting carbon. We carried out comprehensive computer simulations for this hypothetical scenario - gedankenexperiments, if you like. Now people might say: who knows what's in a thousand years? The answer is: physics does. While it's hard to predict the speed of near-term melting, because the climate system is complex, long-term projections are easier. If you put an ice-cube into your living room, in most families guesses on the rate with which the ice cube disappears will diverge. But none of us has a doubt that it will disappear. The reason is that we know the melting temperature of ice - and it is lower than what we normally like to endure in our living room.Graph: Rate of sea-level rise for different cumulative emissions. The available fossil fuel carbon is estimated to be around 10000 billion metric tons of carbon (10000 GtC) as depicted by the red line (Winkelmann et al., 2015).A diamond that needs to stay coalSea-level rise is just one example of why we might not want to warm our planet by 20°F or more. If we want to avoid that we have to keep coal in the ground. That is a well-known fact. So fossil fuels are a present to those who own it, yet one that we cannot unwrap, if we do not want to change our entire planet.Now here is a problem: Even if renewables can provide all the energy humanity needs, fossil fuels would still be worth something as long as you can sell them for more than you need to get them out of the ground and around the world to its consumers. What is needed is an economic mechanism to keep it in the ground. The simplest way is to put a price on carbon emissions.Complement the trading by relocating future riskEurope uses an emissions trading scheme to do exactly that. Emission rights are given to the emitting industries and they can trade them among each other. The total amount of certificates is, in principle, following the emission reduction path that is politically set. The carbon price is then determined by the demand - similar to the trading on a stock market.So much for the trading. But if a company gives out stocks, it receives investment money in return. How does this work for the emission certificates? When the trading scheme was introduced in Europe all emission rights were given out for free and companies were able to profit by selling emission certificates they did not need. Later, part of the emission rights were auctioned which brought some money into public budgets, but the initial price of the certificates was and is not linked to the actual damage the emissions cause. It is an undetermined variable in the equation.An alternative could be to couple this initial price of carbon to climate damages. This should not be confused with a \"cost-benefit analysis\" because a lot of climate impacts cannot be monetarized. There is no price tag one can put on a refugee that is fleeing a monsoon flooding or even \"just\" on a polar bear that is drowning. A lot of climate impacts cannot be monetarized in an ethical way. Thus the total amount of emission should continue to be determined by political will.But just because there are not only monetary reasons to reduce carbon emissions does not mean we have to ignore the monetary ones that exist. It makes a lot of sense that the price of carbon should also reflect the price society pays to repair at least some of the damages caused by climate change. One way could be via the initial price of emission certificates. This way the risk of an increase in climate damages including those that are difficult to predict, like extreme weather events, would be transferred to the emitting industries.The damages are likely to increase over time which creates an additional incentive to find future strategies of carbon reduction. Such a scheme would change the price of carbon but it would not replace a carbon trading scheme. It would complement the trading to incorporate the risk of future climate change and the societal need for adaptation into the price of carbon. Including future risks into your company's strategy is a very common challenge. At the moment the carbon risk for companies lies within the uncertainty of future European policies - not within the uncertainty of future climate. But it is the climate uncertainty against which we want to protect ourselves. It should be the one that determines our strategies.The principle is simple: Once you use the carbon you pay for the damages it creates. This is not uncommon in situations concerning our global commons. For example, damages caused by the disaster of the Deepwater Horizon in 2010 had to be paid for by the company that caused it. The final claim filing deadline for the court-supervised Economic and Property Damages Settlement program for compensation of damages induced by the oil spill has just passed in June this year.Since, in the case of climate change the attribution of specific events to the carbon emissions is scientifically challenging, one might withdraw to an attribution of the total damage increase over time adjusted for economic and demographic growth effects. Also the distribution of the money that is collected for the emission certificates needs some thought. But neither of these complications question the principle: incorporate the risk of future changes into the price of carbon to create the right incentive.Make emission reduction a direct benefitObviously, all costs-of-carbon will come back to society. We will all pay the price for our emissions. The question is how these costs are distributed to create an incentive to best reduce the emissions and thereby the risk of future damages. At the moment, European companies try to assess the decision makers in Brussels because they represent the biggest uncertainty with respect to the future price of carbon. In reality however, the biggest risk for society lies within the uncertainties of future changes of climate itself. To incorporate this risk into the price of carbon is a step that is currently missing.The Munich Re reinsurance company has calculated the meteorologically induced damages during the past three decades to be of the order of four trillion US$, one of which was insured. That means one trillion US$ of uninsured weather-induced damages per decade in the last thirty years. Integrated over a century, this is the same order of magnitude as the cost of transferring our global energy system onto a renewable path as estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - and that sum does not even include possible future changes in the intensity of weather extremes as they are likely to develop in a warming climate.This means that we are currently spending a similar amount of money as we would need to completely transform our energy system just for repairing the damages caused by weather. If we learn how to link changes in this enourmous monetary flow to the emissions of carbon, we will be faster on our path towards a renewable energy system.100 million years ago, we were given a diamond that has to stay coal, if we want to avoid dangerous climate change. We need to find a way to achieve that. A sensible way is to incorporate the risk of future climate change into the price of carbon so that reducing emissions will become a direct benefit.Further reading:R. Winkelmann, A. Levermann, A.

The cost predicted by Project Sunroof for a 300 square foot installation in San Francisco is a whopping $16,761. Google predicts this setup will produce enough energy to replace 96% of the electricity used by a consumer whose average monthly bill is $125. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, California's average monthly bill is lower than that-about $90-so even fog-inundated Bay Area residents could potentially offset most or all of their electricity use with a system this size.If, like many, you just can't foot the initial bill, Google's search tool also estimates how much it would cost a household to lease or loan a solar array. Called a power purchase agreement (PPA), this model is being offered by many companies as an alternative for those unable to own the rig outright. The solar service provider installs their own array on the customer's property, and the resulting power is purchased by the customer. Project Sunroof's estimate to lease an an array the size of the one pictured above is about the same as California's average monthly electricity cost, at $91 per month for a San Francisco resident.Electricity prices have risen in the last decade, and analysts like those at the Deutsch Bank predict they will keep climbing. The 2013 national average price for traditional electricity was 12.22 cents/KWh, but some states pay up to double this, with Hawaii topping the chart at 28.56 cents/KWh. Meanwhile, the Deutsche Bank report calculates unsubsidized solar electricity costs only 8-13 cents/kWh when the expense of the equipment is averaged over its expected life (typically 20-25 years). Adding federal tax credits and other regional solar incentive programs into the equation further lowers prices. So you might not save money the moment your panels are plopped down in the sunshine, but your long-term outlook for power that's cheaper and sustainable is bright.Even if solar power has to remain on your green living wish-list for now, this new online resource is still pretty cool. Quick and simple predictions for savings over time allow us to see the potential that solar energy offers--$23,000 over 20 years for our theoretical San Francisco system. As solar prices continue to drop, hopefully more and more of us will be googling ourselves--or at least our rooftops.Follow Sierra on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and YouTube."}, {"title": "Microbeads Entering Our Water Daily Could Cover 300 Tennis Courts", "text": "Scientists are calling for a total ban on microbeads -- the tiny plastic pieces used in soap, toothpaste and face wash for exfoliation -- after an analysis estimated that 8 trillion of the beads wind up in aquatic habitats every day in the U.S. alone.That’s enough to cover more than 300 tennis courts every day, according to a scientific opinion article published this month in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.“We’re facing a plastic crisis and don’t even know it,” co-author Stephanie Green, a conservation research fellow at the College of Science at Oregon State University, said in a statement. Wastewater treatment plants, she said, simply weren’t designed to handle microbeads, which she describes as “very durable.”Why are these beads such a big deal? It takes so long for plastic to break down that they stick around “virtually forever,” according to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s John F. Calvelli. The beads look like tasty snacks to fish, amphibians and other aquatic life, but due to some of the chemicals used to manufacture them, as well as the pollutants they absorb in the water, they are toxic to consume.When the smaller creatures that eat the beads get eaten by larger animals, the particles make their way up through the food chain, eventually making their way to humans, Calvelli wrote.Microbeads could also be causing coral to starve to death, a March study found. When coral polyps confuse the beads with real food, the plastic can clog up their digestive systems and hinder their ability to digest the nutrients they need.The authors got the 8 trillion number by using figures from previous studies to determine the average amounts of microbeads in a liter of liquid waste discharged from a treatment plant. They then multiplied that number by the amount of wastewater leaving U.S. treatment plants each day, assuming all plants were only operating at half capacity, to come up with what they call a \"conservative estimate.\"And the 8 trillion microbeads entering aquatic habitats directly are only part of the story. In treatment plants, wastewater winds up in “settling tanks” that separate solids from liquid waste. About 95 to 99.9 percent of microbeads that enter such plants settle out with the solids, or sludge. The remaining microbeads become part of the liquid waste that gets expelled into rivers or oceans, according to previous studies the authors cite. That means if 8 trillion microbeads are showing up in liquid waste each day, as many as 800 trillion beads are likely making their way into solid sludge, they write. When some of that sludge winds up being used as fertilizer, an undetermined number of those 800 trillion beads can end up entering streams, rivers and other aquatic habitats via runoff.The paper offers an estimate of microbeads in the environment, not a definite number, noted lead author Chelsea Rochman, a postdoctoral conservation research fellow at the University of California - Davis. The authors had to work with a small amount of peer-reviewed data currently available.“We were simply trying to put some perspective on the potential size of the issue,” she told The Huffington Post.For example, some data about the number of microbeads in liquid waste came from research conducted in Sweden, though Rochman said “there’s no reason to believe” data from U.S. plants would be any different.“Sweden has similar [waste water treatment] technology and products with microbeads,” she said, adding that preliminary data from U.S. liquid waste is “similar” to that from Sweden.Researchers say the data is strong enough to call for a total ban on the beads.“We argue that the scientific evidence regarding microplastic supports legislation calling for a removal of plastic microbeads from personal care products,” Rochman said in a statement.While several states have already enacted laws to regulate or ban microbead-filled products in the future, in some cases the wording allows for loopholes, the researchers point out. For example, Illinois banned the particles but still allows biodegradable microbeads, which could include plastics that break down only slightly.Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com.Language has been added to further clarify why microbeads can be toxic.Correction: A former version of this story called the journal a \"scientific opinion journal.\" It is a scientific research journal, though this paper on microbeads is labeled \"scientific opinion.\""}, {"title": "Florida Paper Pushes For Bike Safety With Aggressive Reporting", "text": "Columbia Journalism Review: How A Florida Newspaper Began Advocating For Better Bike SafetyColumbia Journalism Review: How A Florida Newspaper Began Advocating For Better Bike SafetyWhile there is a certain element of danger to bicycling, particularly for the klutzes among us, some places are more hostile to bicyclists than others -- and no state is worse for bikers than the state of Florida.In an effort to do something about it, the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, created a reporting series and accompanying campaign around bicycle safety, the Columbia Journalism Review’s Susannah Nesmith reports.

It also enables the vehicle to detect when it's undergoing emissions testing, turning on emissions controls only during the test.Essentially, the vehicle \"knows\" when it’s being tested, and fools the system when in the lab or testing station, the EPA said. But in day-to-day driving, the vehicle emits nitrogen oxide well over the allowed amount, contributing to ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter emissions and worsening pollution.“Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,” said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “Working closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules.”The device affected nearly 500,000 cars sold in the U.S. since 2008 -- specifically, the Jetta, Beetle, Golf, Passat and Audi A3 models.Despite the notice, EPA did not order Volkswagen to issue a recall, and said it is giving manufacturers a reasonable amount of time to craft a plan to repair the cars. As a result, it could take at least one year for the agency to identify the steps Volkswagen will have to take and determine if a recall is needed.California regulators also hit Volkswagen with a compliance notice.“Our goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen’s efforts to cheat on clean air rules, and to take appropriate further action,” said Richard Corey, executive officer of the California Air Resources Board."}, {"title": "When A Dog Begs For Forgiveness You Can't Stay Mad", "text": "Sometimes an \"I'm sorry\" doesn't cut it, but when a dog begs for forgiveness it's hard to stay mad.Facebook user Anthony Federica Granai, who lives in Carrar, Italy, recently had a back-and-forth with his dog over an unknown wrongdoing.

Initially, the bill would simply have prohibited cities from prohibiting artificial turf, but a vague amendment was inserted which will allow regulation as long as it does not \"substantially increase the cost of installing synthetic grass or artificial turf.\"It is very true that landscaping accounts for the lion's share of urban water use and curbing the amount of water used for irrigation is a laudable goal. But there are a multitude of natural alternatives to fake grass and these natural alternatives are inherently better for the environment than the Monsanto-ization of our yards.Indeed, the potential impacts of mass replacement of natural, oxygen-producing greenery with plastic turf have not been adequately studied in the rush to get AB 1164 to the governor's pen. First of all, the bill has no permeability requirement for the fake grass which is to replace natural ground covering. Cheaper synthetic turfs are not permeable, creating water-wasting runoff and adding to cities' snowballing stormwater costs, which will come to represent a serious challenge to many cities' fiscal viability.Allowing the replacement of a natural ground-covering with cheap synthetic turf is effectively the same as allowing the replacement of a natural ground-covering with concrete. While Joni Mitchell may send her regards, at the very least, permeability should have been an absolute requirement. Cities, recognizing the need for rainwater to recharge aquifers, could now in theory legislate this requirement, but AB 1164 would allow such a requirement to be challenged, as higher-quality permeable synthetic turf is invariably more expensive.   Many of the legislators who will vote in favor of AB 1146 agree that global warming and climate change are at least partially responsible for California's severe drought. At the same time that Senator Fran Pavley's climate change legislation stalled in Sacramento, it is all the more distressing that no Sacramento legislators took the time to consider the potential environmental impacts of a mass replacement of natural ground coverings with astroturf.It is no secret that yards and/or fields covered by synthetic turf are much warmer--by 40 degrees or more in some cases -- than similar areas covered by grass or water-wise grass alternatives. A 2010 study by the American Meteorological Society confirms that artificial turf can create \"heat islands\" which can significantly raise ambient temperatures and contribute to global warming. By embracing AB 1146, we are faced with a Jekyll and Hyde legislature (and governor when he ultimately signs the bill), who love to tout their own roles in combating climate change, yet who are actually contributing to global warming by pushing their astroturf agenda.In April of this year, the city of Toronto published an extensive \"Health Impact Assessment of the Use of Artificial Turf.\" The report confirmed the common sense climate change concerns created by synthetic turf.  Leaving aside the aesthetic issues, leaving aside the seemingly pathological bent of Sacramento legislators to disrespect local control, and leaving aside potential health issues addressed in the Toronto report (among other studies), a widespread replacement of natural greenery by synthetic turf could have the exact opposite effect of what is intended.For example, the remedy of synthetic turf manufacturers to the heat island effect is nothing if not ironic in view of the bill's professed goal: \"Simply watering the field for 10 minutes will drop its temperature approximately 40 degrees. The temperatures remain lowered for almost 2 hours.\"While it is sad that groups which should be looking out for all of us like the Sierra Club haven't done anything to address this threat, it is sadder yet that Sacramento collectively has shunned both common sense and logic in embracing a short-sighted bill which has the potential to do a lot more damage in the long run.This same group of people, many of whom voted to ban plastic bags and, more recently, microbeads and who oppose GMOs, are now passing a law which under the guise of water saving will create unnecessary landfill problems with the disposal of synthetic turf, as if potential water wastage, depleted aquifers and global warming weren't enough.Mike Gatto, who is evidently priming a run for state Senate next year, might love to add another notch to his list of \"Gatto bills,\" but for the rest of the state, AB 1164, however well-intentioned, is a disastrous Sacramento-made response to a natural California disaster."}, {"title": "A Grassroots Rebellion Makes the POLITICO50", "text": "It's not every day that a grassroots rebellion makes it onto a list of game changers and influencers, but that's what just happened.

Our thousands of organizers, volunteers, attorneys, campaigners, and allies across the U.S. are a tireless, committed, and inspiring group made up of parents, people of faith, public health officials, business leaders, elected officials, and more.It's the work and dedication of this grassroots rebellion that Bruce and I are so humbled to represent on the POLITICO50, and it's their success in transforming how we make energy in America that is being recognized by POLITICO. Whether you've stood up and stood with us over the past decade to save a life, a river, a neighborhood, a mountain, or our climate from coal pollution, this honor belongs to you, too.   So while I'm grateful for the recognition from POLITICO, the real credit goes to all the volunteers and grassroots heroes out there who stopped the construction of 184 coal plants, secured the retirement of 203 coal plants and replaced that coal power with clean renewable energy - in short, the people who made all our progress possible.As a result of their efforts, we're saving over 7,000 lives every year that would have been prematurely cut short by coal pollution, our air and water are cleaner, and the U.S. is turning a corner on climate change and clean energy, with carbon emissions falling fast and the nation positioned to lead going into international climate negotiations in Paris this fall. Our shared progress should give hope to everyone who cares about the health of our families and the future of our planet.There are so many inspiring leaders out there, and I'll just introduce you to one of them, to give you a sense of the people power behind this campaign. Verena Owen (pictured above) is our lead volunteer on the Beyond Coal Campaign and she's been with the campaign since launching it in the very beginning - when it was just a handful of people (including Bruce) who decided in 2002 that the U.S.' rush to build a massive fleet of new coal plants was a huge threat to American public health and to our climate. Verena is a true grassroots hero and a tireless advocate who is most inspired when she is helping others find their voice and connect with their own power to be agents of change. As Verena once said,\"I have learned with the Sierra Club that being a leader does not mean doing everything yourself, but instead enabling others to do it with you.\"I couldn't have said it better myself. I wish I could introduce you to every single one of our fabulous organizers, advocates, and volunteers because every one of them has made a difference. Bruce and I are honored to represent the great work of so many people on the POLITICO50 and I look forward to continuing the Beyond Coal campaign's momentum and successes in the years to come."}, {"title": "Couple Uses 11.5-Foot Bed To Maximize Cuddle Time With 5 Cats, 2 Dogs", "text": "This couple's pets don't have to fight for snuggle space.A proud pet owner named Rob and his girlfriend, who together have two dogs and five cats, recently came up with the perfect sleeping arrangement to make the most out of cuddling with their furry friends.

But most of us don't think of our oceans in the same way; they're a mystery, vast and monolithic.In fact, not far off New England's coast are two of America's most unique and vital seascapes. They provide refuges for a stunning diversity of ocean wildlife-- from whales and dolphins, to ancient coral gardens, to vast kelp forests. And right now, the Obama administration has the chance to protect them forever.Southeast of Cape Cod, where the continental shelf drops off into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, there are canyons as deep as the Grand Canyon and underwater mountains higher than any east of the Rockies. The waters above Coral Canyons and Seamounts teem with ocean wildlife--including tuna, sharks, seabirds, and the endangered sperm and right whales.Approximately 80 miles southeast of Portland, Maine, the ledge of an underwater mountain range creates a flow of nutrients and oxygen that allow diverse marine life to flourish. Cashes Ledge features the largest and deepest cold-water kelp forest on the Atlantic seaboard--with kelp growing so high that in some places it towers over divers' heads. The area also hosts bluefin tuna, sea turtles, sharks, and also provides seasonal habitat for several types of whales, including the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale.Yet destructive activities have already taken a toll on these areas, and the specter of deep-sea mining and drilling casts a shadow over what remains.For more than a century, presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have protected some of America's most treasured landscapes from threats like drilling and mining by designating them as national monuments. Now, the Obama administration is considering safeguarding these amazing seascapes in the same way, by creating the first national marine monument in U.S. Atlantic waters.Marine biologists, charter boat captains, and conservation groups have long called for the protecting these special places off New England's coast. Earlier this month, the New England Aquarium in Boston hosted an event to educate the public as to just why. More than 600 attendees heard from Scott Kraus, one of the world's foremost whale researchers, and viewed breathtaking images from National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry.Within days of the forum, the Obama administration announced it would hold its own listening session--an indication they took the request for the new marine monuments seriously.This week, hundreds more showed up in Providence, R.I. for that town hall, where U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and U.S. House Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut sent video testimony supporting the proposed monument. Rep. Art Handy, chair of the environment committee in the Rhode Island legislature and champion of all things Narragansett Bay, showed his support in person. Whale watching captains and anglers urged protections for marine life for future generations. Eminent marine biologist and Brown professor Jon Witman presented a letter signed by 250 scientists favoring the marine safeguards. By the time of the session, Americans had already weighed in with 160,000 comments in favor.But there are detractors. Republican leaders in Congress have made no secret of their disdain of the president's use of the Antiquities Act, which they decry as \"unilateral action\" -- even though presidents from both parties have long used the law to protect natural features. Maine's Gov. Paul LePage complained in a letter read at hearing of \"the bitter fruit that this unchecked power bears.\"To overcome these opponents, we need to show the Obama administration that Americans value treasures in the ocean as well as treasures on land.

Do you know if your usage spikes on certain days of the week? How many times did you flush the toilet yesterday? A new device could collect all that information for you, eliminating the guesswork.On Monday, Minneapolis-based startup Fluid launched a Kickstarter campaign for a gadget that attaches to your house's water main and listens for water flowing into your home and household appliances. Unlike other usage-estimating services, the Fluid device is designed to send real-time usage updates directly to your smartphone, educating you about your consumption patterns and encouraging you to conserve. It might even help you save on your water bill.\"The big thing for us, more than anything, is to get consumers more in touch with how they use water and just, hopefully, help people change their behavior once they really start to understand how much they use so we can all conserve water and save money,\" Fluid's founder, Colin Hirdman, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.The product comes at a time of increasingly greater need for water conservation. The average American uses between 80 and 100 gallons per day via fixtures like showers and toilets, as well as appliances like dishwashers and laundry machines. Household leaks also account for 1 trillion wasted gallons a year -- enough to fill 40 million swimming pools.Fluid uses ultrasonic technology to track the speed and velocity at which water flows into each fixture and appliance in your house. After you attach the gadget to your water main, you plug it into a power outlet and connect it to WiFi to get it ready for use. Then, before you take a shower or run the dishwasher, you tell the Fluid app which appliance or fixture you're about to use, and the water-monitoring device will analyze the water flow to that part of the house.Over time, Fluid is supposed to learn about your habits and create breakdowns based on those data. The app lets you see the amount of water consumed in different parts of your home, fluctuations in usage throughout the day or week and more. It will also alert you when it thinks you've sprung a leak.Here, Fluid's app offers an overview of a household's water consumption (left) and identifies a possible leak.However, because Fluid is tracking the speed and velocity of the water flowing into all your household appliances through the same pipe, its data might not be accurate if you have tons of appliances on at the same time -- like if you're taking a shower while running the dishwasher, for example.\"If you turn on everything in your house at the same time, it's going to have a much harder time telling what's what, versus when you're running one thing at a time,\" Hirdman said. \"The more things you run at once, the more difficult it is.\"Its leak detector might not be the most accurate, either.\"If somebody's water is running for an hour and a half straight or hours straight, we would notify them that they may have a leak on their property based on the constant flow of water,\" Hirdman said.(Then again, if you're purposely running water for hours on end, then you might need a wake-up call anyway.)Currently, there are online tools like Home Water Works' water calculator and Grace Communications Foundation's water footprint calculator that estimate your daily water usage based on your living habits. Fluid, however, listens to water physically flowing into your house and uses that to create data for you to examine.As of Friday morning, Fluid's Kickstarter campaign had raised more than $55,000 -- over half the $95,000 goal the company hopes to reach by Oct. 14. If the funding is successful, a Fluid device will cost $209 and will ship next May.In the meantime, here are some quick tips on how you can conserve your water usage.H/T TechCrunch"}, {"title": "How This City Went 100 Percent Green In Energy Usage", "text": "Aspen, Colorado is best known for its ritzy ski slopes, but it also just became the third American city to run fully on renewable energy.The city joins the ranks of Greensburg, Kansas and Burlington, Vermont, which went 100 percent renewable in 2013 and 2014, respectively.Aspen made the switch from 75 percent to fully renewable in August when it signed a contract with the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska, a wholesale electric energy provider. This allowed wind power to take the place of coal, former city project coordinator Will Dolan told the Denver Post.The rest of Aspen’s energy sources are domestic, too: The city receives wind energy from Nebraska and South Dakota and hydropower from within Colorado itself.Although Aspen has a year-round population of fewer than 7,000, its green efforts have been underway for over a decade. In 2005, they created the Canary Initiative, which identifies mountain communities like Aspen as \"canaries in the coal mine\" because they are affected by climate change before other locations.The city frames its achievement as part of a larger citywide goal to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions 30 percent below 2004 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 2004 levels by 2050.The area's transition has been facilitated by the steep decline in price of renewable energy source, including solar, geothermal and wind, over the last few years.The three other cities that have successfully made the clean energy leap present lessons for other American cities that want to follow their lead.All these areas have high-level direction from their municipal government. For instance, the mayor of Greensburg devised a \"master sustainability plan\" to go fully renewable after the town was devastated by a tornado in 2007. It achieved that goal in just six years thanks to parallel infrastructure projects like the Greensburg Wind Farm.Greensburg is even smaller than Aspen, with about 850 residents, which likely helped it make the switch so swiftly. But Burlington, the third fully renewable city, is actually the largest city in Vermont, with a population of more than 42,000.Burlington is part of a statewide movement in Vermont to get 90 percent of all its energy from renewable sources by 2050, as reported in the Boston Globe. As in Aspen, utility officials in the notably liberal city of Burlington started planning for 100 percent renewable energy over a decade ago.If recent government investments are any indication, it will be even easier for American cities to go renewable. As HuffPost reported this month, the U.S. just made its largest-ever investment in solar energy in Arizona. And due to the Obama administration’s regulations, fossil fuels are getting more expensive by the day.As Aspen energy official David Hornbacher told the Aspen Times, the city has shown how “a small, progressive community can work together to be a pathway for others…[and] we hope we can inspire others to achieve these higher goals.”Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "GOP Congressman Boycotting Pope's Speech Over Climate Change", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Rep.

Gosar said he has a moral obligation to call out the pope for ignoring more pressing issues, like the persecution of Christians.“If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time,” he said. “But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.”Scientists have already established that human activity causes climate change.

That all changed this February, a few minutes after a pediatrician pricked their toddler son's toe. The rapid blood test revealed the presence of lead.Tiny, largely invisible particles of the poison, they would later confirm, had taken residence in their home -- making them one of the at least 4 million households with children that are exposed to deteriorated lead paint and elevated levels of lead dust, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now Fishman, the drummer for the band Phish, wants to share what he's learned so that other parents have their young children screened for lead. He also wants to ensure people avoid renting, buying, selling or remodeling a home while blind to the threat of the neurotoxic heavy metal.\"I'm just trying to parlay the little celebrity I have to raise awareness,\" he said. Fishman recently donated to the completion of \"MisLEAD,\" a forthcoming film on the lead issue, and will be hosting screenings in Vermont this October.Homes built in the early to mid-20th century, during the heyday of lead-based paint, are most worrisome. Yet risks may reside in and around any building constructed or painted before 1978, when lead was finally banned from residential paint sold in the U.S.\"Lead is all over the damn place — aging and chipping,\" said Fishman, who also discovered lead hazards in a lakeside cottage and a general store his family owns. \"It's an epidemic. And it's causing serious health problems in lots of kids around the country.\"Of course, the majority of children who suffer from lead poisoning aren't celebrity kids with multiple residences. Risks are generally highest in low-income communities, where lead paint can often be seen peeling from poorly-maintained properties. But the poison can still find its way onto the hands and into the mouth of any child.\"Lead's presence in the environment has nothing to do with being rich or poor. More rich people are buying older places, and then going in and stirring up the lead,\" added Fishman. \"That's exactly what I did.\"Thanks in part to the ban on lead paint, the rise of lead-safe regulations and more widespread awareness, fewer children today are exposed to very high levels of lead -- concentrations that in previous generations all-too-commonly produced obvious, devastating effects such as seizures or death. Scientific findings over recent years, however, have taken some of the wind out of the public health community's sails: even very low levels of exposure to lead can also cause long-term, albeit more subtle, harm.The CDC responded to this mounting evidence in 2012 by reducing the level at which they consider a child to be lead poisoned from 10 to 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood. Still, nearly all states continue to use a threshold of 10 micrograms or higher before they take an action such as forcing a landlord to remediate a property. Maine passed a law this summer to become the first state in the country to set the CDC's blood lead level of 5 micrograms per deciliter as its official threshold of intervention.Leading health experts, meanwhile, warn that there is no \"safe\" level of lead in the blood. A developing child's exposure to just a speck of lead dust, research suggests, may leave them a little slower to learn, a little shorter of attention, a little less successful on tests and at work, and a little more likely to engage in criminal activity. A 2012 study estimated lead exposure in the U.S. is responsible for a nationwide loss of 23 million IQ points.The public health impact is significant. For example, according to research published last year, childhood lead poisoning costs Michigan alone about $330 million each year through increases in health care, incarceration, and special education and declines in lifetime earnings.Adults are far from immune to lead and its health effects. Studies have hinted that chronic blood lead levels as low as 2 micrograms per deciliter may raise the risk of death from a heart attack or stroke. Evidence is also emerging of lead's role in cognitive decline, reproductive disorders and kidney problems, among other health issues common among Americans.\"It's an issue for us all,\" said Richard Reibstein, a lead paint expert at Boston University who formerly served as lead law enforcement attorney for the Environmental Protection Agency. \"And it's far more critically important to the health of our society than a lot of people realize.\"'Invisible Poison'Upon leaving the pediatrician's office, Fishman and his wife did everything they knew to rid their home of lead. They covered weathered coatings on doorways and trims with a milk-based paint. They thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed. Yet a second blood test a couple weeks later showed their son's blood lead level had actually risen since the first test, from 4.3 to 5.0 micrograms per deciliter.Fearing their lead removal efforts had backfired, the family evacuated to a newer home in Vermont. (Fishman noted their good fortune to have such an option -- one that's not usually available for a low-income family facing the same predicament .) Their son's blood soon tested free of detectable lead. Still, they worry that the potential toll of his earlier exposure may not be clear until he's older. In fact, any effects might prove to be too subtle to ever peg to the toxin.Fishman suspects a number of sources could have resulted in his son's lead poisoning, including old paint that was stripped from the farmhouse floor during renovations about a year and a half ago, leaving an \"invisible poison floating around.\" He also fears they stirred up dust when they initially cleaned the house with a vacuum that lacked a HEPA filter.\"This is the kind of stuff that I know now,\" said Fishman. He and his wife recently vetted and hired a new lead-safe certified contractor to clear their farmhouse of the heavy metal. They plan to move back in when the work is completed later this month.The EPA recommends a number of preventative measures, such as enlisting a certified inspector or risk assessor to determine if lead hazards reside in your home, keeping painted surfaces in good condition, and regularly cleaning floors, window sills and other surfaces. Lead dust can materialize when a window painted or trimmed with lead-based paint is open or closed, or when the toxic coating is dry scraped, sanded or heated. That's why the EPA urges people to hire only EPA- or state-approved lead-safe certified firms when renovating, repairing or painting.\"If you find lead, it can be a giant pain in the ass,\" added Fishman. \"But I just can't stress enough that, if you discover it in your environment, you do something about it and do your due diligence to make sure it is done right.\"Leveraging LawsNo federal law actually requires any testing or removal of lead paint, though experts agree there need to be stronger lead laws, along with greater enforcement and awareness.According to the EPA's 2010 \"Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting\" rule, contractors must be trained in and follow lead-safe practices to prevent the spread of lead particles during home renovations. But an investigation by the Maine Center for Public Reporting in August found that the law is widely unenforced both in the state and nationwide, likely leading to a host of toxic situations like the one in the Fishman's home.\"The essence of the law is to keep a contractor from leaving a big, dusty mess,\" Reibstein, the former lead law enforcement attorney, told HuffPost. \"Laws don't work well if people don't understand them.\"A group of graduate students recently helped Reibstein survey states' awareness about both the RRP rule and blood lead screening. \"The answers we got showed this tremendous variability,\" he said.Federal law also requires that landlords and homeowners notify future tenants and buyers of any known lead hazards. If no specific details are known, they are to at least provide a generic warning that old homes may contain lead paint, as well as a pamphlet with tips on how to identify and control such hazards and how to protect children. Those guidelines range from cleaning a child's hands before they eat to keeping their diet rich in calcium, which makes the body less likely to absorb lead.\"The pamphlet is full of excellent advice, yet few people look inside it,\" added Reibstein. \"The more people know, the better they can protect themselves.\"In addition to reading that pamphlet, he recommends that buyers of pre-1978 homes take advantage of their right to conduct a lead inspection before committing to a contract. And he suggests that sellers seriously consider properly testing for and removing any lead paint before putting their property on the market. It's the \"right thing to do,\" he said. \"It provides confidence. And it may be well received by the customer.\"When an owner hires someone to do renovation or lead removal work, he added, they should ask for a detailed description of the job and documentation of the work along the way -- even if the contractor is lead-safe certified. The RRP rule, for example, requires that contractors wipe the floor of the work area with disposable cleaning cloths and compare those cloths to a cleaning verification card at the end of a job. Reibstein suggests actually watching workers perform this last step.But even that might not be enough to guarantee the absence of lingering lead.Ruth Ann Norton, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, highlighted a new state law in Maryland that will soon take the RRP rule a step further, requiring a more stringent lead dust test after work has been completed. The test can show trace amounts of lead dust that might not be visible on cleaning cloths."}, {"title": "You Know Your Dog Best -- and it Could Save His Life", "text": "style=\"float: left; margin:10px\"Tuesday afternoon, after being gone most of the day, I returned home to find Sierra looking strange. She had been acting perfectly normal when I left her in the morning, but now she just stood there, hindquarters trembling, eyes slightly squinty, just looking wrong somehow. It crossed my mind that it had been raining and perhaps there had been thunder, which frightens her. I called her to me but she stood there staring. I realize many pet parents would, at this point, elect to keep a careful eye on their dog or try to make them comfortable and hope the weirdness would pass. But, as my husband always says, Sierra and I have an almost telepathic bond, and I just knew something was wrong. I put Bodhi outside with his dinner, got Sierra into the car, and headed to the vet's office.The vet did blood work and took x-rays. Her explanation of what she suspected amounted to congestive heart failure, although she didn't use those words. She recommended a cardiologist who was about an hour away, and after calling him for us, said if I could get there within the next 90 minutes he could see Sierra. Fortunately, the L.A. traffic gods were with me. Between that and my utter panic, we made it in under 45 minutes. One echocardiogram, more blood work, and a few x-rays later, the cardiologist had ruled out a heart issue. Great. But Sierra had a fever of over 105 and she was septic. (My mother, who is critically ill, had gone into septic shock the same day. What are the chances?) They suggested putting her on antibiotics and keeping her overnight, hoping the antibiotics would clear up whatever was wrong. They didn't. The next day her fever was still dangerously high. My husband and I drove to the clinic, where they explained that an ultrasound had showed abnormal fluid around Sierra's stomach. That and other factors led them to suggest exploratory surgery. We were shocked, but I immediately agreed. Again, I knew something was seriously wrong, and I didn't want to waste a minute trying different antibiotics and hoping one would help.Two very long hours later, I called the vet. They had just finished surgery, and Sierra had come through it. They had discovered an abscessed mass on her liver that had ruptured and spread infection through her body. They were able to remove the mass and stabilize her, but there were a few other smaller masses on her liver that were worrisome. Removing them all would have meant taking most of her liver, so only the large one was excised. According to the vet, the other masses were on the smaller, benign looking side, but there is of course no way of knowing without a biopsy. So now we wait 3-5 days for results.I'm not someone who shares much of my personal life on Facebook, in blog posts, or elsewhere publicly. But I share this to say that if I hadn't rushed Sierra to the vet and she hadn't had that surgery, things might have been dire. No matter what anyone says, regardless of those voices of reason telling you to wait and see, not to be a panicky, overprotective dog parent, that everything will be fine, listen to your intuition. I'm not suggesting you rush your dog to the vet any time she looks a little strange. But no one knows your dog better than you, and acting on that intuition just might save your dog's life.Nicole Wilde is a canine behavior specialist and author. Visit her website.

Peaceful and loving\" -- Jean HoustonI had the privilege of being born in a rural area of the mountain tops of Jalisco, Mexico. Where I could roam free with the neighbor's watching over me, and the sun, stars, and moon being my compass. If I was hungry I would climb a pomegranate tree, or a guava tree to eat some refreshing fruit. There's one cow that you would see alive in the morning taken to the butcher shop, and that was the same cow everyone ate that day. People grow their vegetables in their front yard or home and go door by door selling them, if not to vendors.Then the migration to the Unites States occurred.My high senses knew the food was different. Not in a refreshing way, in a way I could not explain or figure out.The satisfaction of eating was not met, and the same enthusiasm for eating was not the same.As a child I wouldn't eat, due to this change.I couldn't communicate as to why I didn't want to eat, because I didn't know how to get through what I tasted, and how I felt from it. Time passed and I refused to eat at Chicago Public schools, the food was beyond fake to my liking. Eating the apples, fresh fruit and milk only. The America-born kids I went to school with wondered as to why I wouldn't eat the pizza, burger or PBJ sandwich. Then I would rush home and devour my mother's cooking, being fresh boiled beans, pico de gallo (cilantro, lime, onion, avocado and tomato) and some kind of steak or chicken.You see being an immigrant in a huge city, with low income in the family, your options are very scarce when it comes to anything. I had no clue organic food existed or wouldn't for years to come. Then came my first job, at 15. I worked with my siblings in a fancy Chicago suburb in which Whole Foods existed.The taste buds from my childhood awakened, my enthusiasm for eating bolted out of me.So I wondered what was in that food I refused to eat.That is genetically modified food, also known as GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Due to \"human growth population\" a company that produced deadly chemicals for the Vietnam War switched over to making chemicals for food. Adding ways to prevent weeds from over taking crops, and pests from damaging the crops. While enhancing the food production, to feed more humans worldwide.The chemically-infused seeds and chemicals used to grow these seeds all stay in the crops, soil, and air. You can find their toxic chemicals in breast milk or urine.It doesn't stop there, these chemicals vary from food, to vaccines, therapies, and animals. Livestock are fed these genetically modified foods as well. And these chemicals are getting stronger since the pest and weeds have become resilient to the chemicals. The main targets are kids since their immune system and bodies are not as strong as adults.There are over 60 countries worldwide, all of Europe, Japan, Australia and Russia who have banned GMOs, because their farmers and civilians didn't like the toxicity and monopoly these GMOs came with. For example you have to purchase the genetically modified seeds every year from Monsanto (one of the companies) instead of taking the seeds from the actual fruits and vegetables and saving them for the following year, as it can be done.Here in America the top 6 GMO producers own the world's seeds, pesticide and biotechnology industries. While they make sure to keep us consuming their creations with compassionate propaganda. They spread their GMO foods in hospitals, schools, jails, and super markets.States have tried to pass bills that mandate labeling GMOs, so people have a say over if they wish to purchase foods as such or organic. Resulting in the GMO companies threating to sue states, entire states! Vermont being one of them.There are currently millions worldwide working on GMO labeling and affordable organic food. I am one of these millions, and my priority is to bring organic food to minority neighborhoods, to schools, to a coffee shop, and even a gas station. If you wish to seek more information as to how you can avoid GMOs in your food, you can check out nongmoproject.org, for further explanation on GMOs. There are also small stores that are mainly organic or big stores that offer organic foods, one of them being Whole Foods. I recommend googling your area for such stores.Some ideas of what I have done are -- go to your local food market and request organic food, ask restaurants if they can provide organic food as well, write emails to your favorite people (Oprah, Beyoncé, Shakira, or Angelina Jolie) for support in your concerns, and look around your community to see if there are organic gardens or foundations supporting organic food. And most of all inform your loved ones.A great woman once mentored me, saying \"Be conscious of what you spend your money on, it is your choice as to what you consume.\" Sean Corn Thank you"}, {"title": "A New Chapter for Peter Cottontail", "text": "Less than a decade ago, the New England Cottontail, the inspiration behind the popular children's book character Peter Cottontail, was destined for the Endangered Species List. Thanks to the efforts of a broad coalition of conservation partners and the leadership from the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New York, today the New England cottontail is coming back.Just last week I was privileged to join Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Natural Resources Conservation Service Chief Jason Weller, state wildlife agency directors, and partners from across the Northeast to announce that as a result of ongoing and planned conservation actions, the New England Cottontail has been taken off the list of species under consideration for protection.This is good news -- and not just for the rabbits. Conserving habitat for the New England cottontail also enhances outdoor recreational opportunities in one of the country's most densely populated areas, improving residents' quality of life and providing increased tourism and recreation-related support for local communities. In addition, at least 65 other kinds of wildlife also depend on young forest habitat, including woodcock, prairie warbler, eastern towhee, catbird, bobcat, box turtle and the frosted elfin butterfly.The New England cottontail's remarkable return is a testament to the benefits provided by the Endangered Species Act to both listed and non-listed species, as well as the people and communities sharing the landscape with them. For some, such as Rick and Donna Ambrose, conserving wildlife is simply an extension of good land management. The couple has cleared about 10 acres of their property in Dover, N.H., removed invasive plants and planted shrubs to support the cottontail effort on their land. Rick also has helped other landowners with habitat restoration through his excavation business. \"We have always had an appreciation for the wildlife that abounds on our property,\" he says. \"If our participation convinces other small landowners to commit to wildlife habitat restoration, then the natural effects will become evident and our participation will be purposeful.\"Guided by the ambitious New England Cottontail Conservation Strategy, partners have invested in habitat management and land acquisition, research, monitoring, and outreach related to young forest restoration, such as assisting private landowners with managing habitats on their lands. Flexibilities within the Endangered Species Act have supported these efforts and enabled the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine that with the continued investments outlined in this plan, the species no longer faces the threat of extinction.More than 18,000 acres of young forest habitat are now or will soon be available for the cottontail in priority focus areas, and this successful partnership is on track to reach 27,000 acres by 2030. For the first time in history, we've successfully bred and raised more than 150 New England cottontails in captivity and released them at multiple locations.The cottontail's story exemplifies how the Endangered Species Act can and does work -- as a safety net of last resort, when necessary. But more commonly, as a catalyst for partnership-driven conservation efforts that improve the health of our lands and waters for both people and wildlife.Far from being the economic burden that some opponents of the ESA allege, the ESA provides flexibility so that local communities can come together to improve the health and productivity of the land, contribute to economic prosperity and strengthen tourism and recreation-based economies.The cottontail partnership is just one example of how we can collaborate with a broad array of stakeholders to tailor cost-effective solutions to the needs of the species and local communities. Through the Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture are using voluntary incentives to collaborate with landowners across the nation willing to conserve at-risk species including the cottontail, eastern bog turtle, golden-winged warbler, gopher tortoise, greater sage-grouse, lesser prairie-chicken and southwestern willow flycatcher.Together with our state and other partners, we've come so far. We have helped write a new chapter for the New England cottontail, and through continued efforts to strengthen and improve the Endangered Species Act, we can do the same for other imperiled species across the country. In the end, their story and our story are one and the same."}, {"title": "Knobby-Faced Beast May Be Earliest Known To Stand Tall On All Fours", "text": "Dogs do it. Cats do it. Pigs, cows, and hippos, too. But a new study suggests that the earliest known animal to have walked upright on all fours was a bizarre \"pre-reptile\" that lived some 260 million years ago.Dubbed Bunostegos akokanensis, the prehistoric plant-eater was the size of a cow, and walked like a cow. But its face was studded with big bony knobs.Paleontologists first identified the B. akokanensis in 2003 after discovering a fossilized skull in the Sahara Desert of northern Niger. Now scientists have concluded that Bunostegos  stood on all fours with its bulky body raised off the ground--unlike any other animal that roamed the supercontinent Pangea at the time.(Story continues below image.)\"We don’t see upright posture, with the legs underneath the body, in both the forelimb and the hindlimb in a single animal until much later, in mammals and in dinosaurs,\" Morgan Turner, a Ph.D. student at Brown University in Rhode Island and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Bunostegos is much further back on the evolutionary tree than anything else that exhibits this posture [and] hints at a larger story about posture and locomotion evolution... The anatomy of Bunostegos is unexpected, illuminating, and tells us we still have much to learn.\"For the study, the researchers examined fossilized Bunostegos bones including those of the shoulder, the elbow, the forelimb bone known as humerus and another forelimb bone known as the ulna. The researchers found that the hip joint in the hind limbs and the bones that make up the forelimbs had features seen only in upright animals.\"Aspects of the anatomy of the shoulder and the forelimb indicate that the humerus could not have jutted out in a 'sprawling' posture,\" Dr. Linda Tsuji, contract assistant curator at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"and in Bunostegos we see limited motion at the elbow joint, which is an indication of upright posture in other animals.\"Walking upright on all fours may have allowed Bunostegos to travel long distances--an ability that might have helped it survive the central desert of Pangea where it lived, Turner said.\"Here's this big, cow-sized animal in this very arid region,\" Dr. Nick Fraser, vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museums of Scotland, who was not involved in the study, told The Huffington Post in a telephone interview. \"You don't think of big herbivores in arid regions.

All the media attention recently given to political figures will now shift to a moral leader who is changing the global public discussion about what is compassionate, just, good, and right -- and Christian.This is a fundamental spiritual shift that we deeply need in our country right now. Three major East Coast cities will have their typical traffic patterns and lodging arrangements severely disrupted. I'm not predicting an earthquake or a hurricane -- instead, for only the tenth time in our nation's history, the pope, spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics worldwide, will visit the United States.The last papal visit was from Pope Benedict XVI in 2008. Pope Francis' visit to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City, which will take place from September 22-27, is expected to be historic in terms of the crowds it generates, with well over one million people anticipated for the Philadelphia portion alone.But this is much more than just another papal visit. The pope coming to America next week has become the world's conversation-changer. And we have not seen that for a long time -- especially from a religious leader.During the course of his visit, Pope Francis will address Congress and the United Nations, preside over worship services, and take part in parades -- none of which is particularly surprising for a visiting pontiff. But the pope isn't limiting himself to this sort of high-profile event. He is also spending an unprecedented amount of his trip interacting with the people Jesus calls the \"least of these\" in Matthew 25 -- including refugees and immigrants, homeless and disabled men and women, low-income schoolchildren, and prisoners. Some of these people are the very same people who are demonized in our nation's recent political discussions, and are regularly ignored by most of our politicians.It's these events on the pope's schedule that should attract the notice of all people of faith and conscience -- Catholics and non-Catholics alike -- because they exemplify who Pope Francis is as a person and as a leader. As one of his job titles, the \"Vicar of Christ,\" indicates, he strives to promote the teachings of Jesus by acting like Jesus acts in the Gospels. That means focusing as much of his time and energy as he can on the people with whom Jesus spent the most time.From the beginning of his tenure as pope, Francis has used his position to change our conversations about what, and who, is important. In his words and his actions, he has challenged narratives and assumptions about the Catholic church, the world economic order, immigration, and the environment -- to name a few issues. Next week, in addition to his true vocation of ministering directly to those on society's margins, he will also step into the center of the halls of power and influence and onto some of the world's largest stages. I fully expect he will bring the concerns and priorities of the \"least of these\" to those who too often seem blind and deaf to them. And through the massive media coverage he will receive, that message will have the opportunity to reach people all over the country and the world, from all faiths, backgrounds, and walks of life.The pope is changing the perception of the church from being closed and judging to becoming open and encountering -- reminding us that the \"joy of the gospel,\" as he calls it, is to embrace each other and especially those we have left out and behind; and to protect and preserve this earth we have as our common home.Since its founding, Sojourners' primary mission has been to articulate the biblical call to social justice -- a call that may have no clearer a standard-bearer right now than Pope Francis. So it is our intention next week to be a \"go-to\" place for our readers -- of all affiliations -- to keep up with everything the pope is doing and saying during his trip to champion the causes of social justice, the common good, and the most vulnerable.Here's a quick look at the major ways that Sojourners will be giving you access to the pope's visit and message next week:My hope is that you will join us online next week as we experience the pope's visit together, and discuss what it means for us as Christians, seekers of justice, and people working together for the common good. It will be a delight to see the national conversation in America change next week -- a change we are morally desperate for, and one we must all continue to engage in in the weeks ahead.

Consider, for example, the U.S. Navy's testing and training with heavy explosives and high-intensity sonar in species-rich coastal waters around the world.Blue whale: A blue whale fluking off Southern California. Blue whales are the largest animal ever to have lived on the planet and are considered endangered. The settlement protects important blue whale foraging grounds off San Diego County, California. (Credit: John Calambokidis/ Cascadia Research.)Since 1994, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has prosecuted a series of federal lawsuits to persuade the Navy to adopt -- and its federal regulator the National Marine Fisheries Service to require -- common sense safeguards for the protection of whales and other marine life from unnecessary and avoidable harm. In none of these cases has a choice been required between training or not, between military readiness or not; in every case the choice presented has been training recklessly - in violation of federal law -- or training in an environmentally responsible way.With a groundbreaking settlement of two lawsuits this week, there is renewed hope that the Navy's commitment to adopt significant new safeguards on two of its most important training ranges - in waters off southern California and Hawaii - could signal a fundamental shift in its approach toward wildlife conservation in the oceans in which it operates. For the first time, among other measures, the Navy has agreed to forego entirely or limit significantly its planned explosives testing and mid-range sonar training in designated areas of special importance to the survival of majestic blue whales, deep-diving beaked whales, critically endangered false killer whales, and other marine mammals needlessly put at risk by Navy training.Melon-headed whale: A group of melon-headed whales off Hawaii. Several small populations of melon-headed whales, ordinarily a deep-water species, reside around the Hawaiian Islands. In 2004, about 150-200 whales were trapped in Hanalei Bay during a Navy sonar exercise, and were rescued by locals. The settlement protects their habitat around the Big Island of Hawaii. (Credit: Daniel L. Webster/ Cascadia Research.)This agreement reflects real progress, with a solid commitment by the Navy to the most meaningful protective measures that NRDC and others, supported by the marine science community, have long sought. It is an important breakthrough in the Navy's relationship to the oceans.Why now? And what does this portend for the Navy's willingness to adopt similar safeguards in its training elsewhere, in other ranges not covered by the settlement? According to a Navy spokesperson for the Pacific Fleet earlier this week, the Navy agreed to the settlement because it faced \"a real possibility that the court would stop critically important testing and training,\" needed to \"prepare for missions in support of our national security.\"And, indeed, the Navy had reason to worry:In a decision issued last spring in the cases settled this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway rejected in no uncertain terms, under a number of environmental laws, the Navy's position. She cited, for example, the Navy's \"total failure to clearly consider important information\" and \"flaws so fundamental that the [environmental planning] document needs to be totally rewritten.\" Judge Mollway concluded that \"the Navy's categorical and sweeping statements, which allow for no compromise at all as to space, time, species, or condition, do not constitute the 'hard look' required\" by federal law.Cuvier's beaked whale: A rare photo of a (Hawaiian) Cuvier's beaked whale, which, at 3000 meters, has recorded the deepest dives ever seen in a marine mammal. Beaked whales are acutely vulnerable to mid-frequency sonar, having repeatedly figured in mass strandings associated with Navy sonar training. The settlement protects beaked whale habitat off Hawaii and in Southern California. (Credit: Daniel L. Webster/ Cascadia Research.)But faced with such unequivocal language, the Navy chose to negotiate -- rather than elevate the battle to the appellate court - and, in so doing, it displayed an encouraging evolution in the perspective of its leadership. The uncompromising but long held notion that national security requires virtually every square mile of the world's oceans to be available for training with heavy explosives and high-intensity sonar, regardless of the risks to sensitive resources, simply argues too much, whether in a court of law or in the court of public opinion. Central to this week's agreement is a recognition around the table that, consistent with military readiness, geographical or seasonal training exclusions are feasible, and in that recognition lies the promise of lasting progress.All of us have a critical stake in our national security, and we owe a lasting debt of gratitude to the servicemen and women who secure it. But the mere assertion of a national security interest has never provided a blanket exemption from compliance with federal law. And on issues going far beyond environmental protection, the military has a long and unsuccessful history of resistance on that basis to important changes in deeply entrenched practices.False killer whale: A false killer whale mother and calf off the main Hawaiian Islands. The settlement protects their habitat around the Big Island, Maui, and Molokai. These whales are listed as endangered, with only 150 remaining. (Credit: Dan McSweeney/ Cascadia Research.)Outlawing racial discrimination in the military, for example, took decades. Ending discrimination based on sexual preference took just as long. The role of women in combat remains unresolved today, although there is progress on the horizon. In each case, the consistent justification for perpetuating discrimination - in opposing changes that society as a whole has come to accept as morally and strategically responsible -- has been that military effectiveness and readiness would be compromised. The Navy's assertion of that same rationale in opposing common-sense safeguards to protect the oceans is similarly indefensible.This week's agreement isn't the final word. But it is a promising indication that the Navy can accomplish its core mission in a manner that reduces the unnecessary infliction of harm.

He founded NRDC's Marine Mammal Protection Project in 1994."}, {"title": "University of Colorado Part of Fracking PR Scheme", "text": "An investigation by Greenpeace and the Boulder Weekly has found troubling ties between the University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado public relations firms working on behalf of the fracking industry and the Koch brothers.The controversy centers on the partnership between the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business and the Common Sense Policy Roundtable (CSPR), a front group funded by the oil and gas industry.This partnership was formed to produce economic studies that benefit the fracking industry's PR strategy. CSPR paid the university to host the studies and fully controlled the priorities of the researchers.Documents obtained by Greenpeace reveal that the studies were conceived of, edited and strategically used by PR firms to influence fracking policy in Colorado, yet CSPR's financial ties to the oil and gas industry were not disclosed to the media or in the published studies. The studies provided seemingly third-party validation for the oil industry's attack on environmental regulations.FrackademiaThe shale drilling and fracking industry has a record of secretly funding seemingly \"independent\" research that supports their agenda. This report by the Public Accountability Initiative charts examples of industry funding questionable academic papers and projects. This has been dubbed \"frackademia.\"Claims that fracking has few environmental or human health impacts have largely drowned out actual scientific proof that fracking can cause serious pollution issues. The claims of fracking's necessity and safety have been buoyed by studies secretly funded by the industry.CSPR Uses University of Colorado Research in Pro-Fracking CampaignInternal documents from the University of Colorado reveal a coordinated plan to use UC branded papers in a PR campaign designed to promote and defend the oil and gas industry.CSPR set priorities for the researchers, prioritizing oil and gas work. The studies were aimed at politically contentious topics, like local regulation over fracking wells.Case Study: Standing in the Way of Fracking BansOne such study was the 2014 Fracking Ban Report. The report, published during a major political storm regarding local control over fracking, found that allowing affected communities to hold some regulatory power over fracking would hurt Colorado's economy -- a position favored by the industry. The report, which was paid for by CSPR, did not mention the group's financial ties to the fracking industry.The study's release was strategically planned by Starboard Group and EIS Solutions, two influential PR firms with oil and gas clients. The firms used the report as a mobilization tool for Vital for Colorado, CRED, and other anti-regulatory front groups, which share board members and staff with CSPR. Kristin Strohm, managing partner of Starboard Group, coordinated fracking industry PR and media departments to promote the study.CSRP's own literature claims the study had a profound impact, boasting that the report was \"cited in all debates\" on fracking ballot initiatives.Case Study: In Bed With the American Petroleum InstituteThe documents also reveal a troubling willingness on the part of the university to sell its researchers to the highest bidder.In one example, a study was conceived, funded and edited by the American Petroleum Institute (API), the largest oil industry lobby group in the U.S. The report charted the positive economic impact from fracking on a county by county basis. It did not factor in the negative economic consequences of pollution.API initially proposed the study in 2013, during an intense political fight in Colorado over the ability of communities impacted by shale drilling and fracking pollution to impose regulations on the industry.The degree of control API had over the study is telling.API even wrote media-ready quotes for Brian Lewandowski once the study was released.API has a long history of secretly funding research that benefits its oil industry funders, including funding researcher Willie Soon's discredited climate research for years.Common Sense Policy Roundtable's Deep Ties to the Fracking Industry and the Koch BrothersThe Common Sense Policy Roundtable is a non-profit created by Starboard Group and EIS Solutions to control and fund the research conducted by the University of Colorado Boulder.Lem Smith is a funder and board member for CSPR. He is also the Director for U.S. Government and Regulatory Affairs for Encana, one of the largest fracking corporations in Colorado. In CSPR pamphlets from 2011, Encana is listed as a \"partner.\" Smith is also on the board of Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas front group known for its aggressive tactics. Smith is also chairman of the Colorado Petroleum Association.In addition to Encana, CSPR pamphlets list multiple other oil and gas companies as \"partners.\"Scott Martin is chairman and CEO of EE3, an oil and gas company based in Colorado. He also sits on the board and funds CSPR.CSPR was created by the Starboard Group and staffed in part by EIS Solutions - two PR firms with close ties to the oil and gas industry, including the billionaire Koch brothers. Earlier this year, the two firms were revealed to be behind a web of front groups in Colorado that oppose regulations on fracking.Starboard Group was founded by Kristin Strohm, the firm's managing partner. Strohm, a top republican political operative in Colorado, also serves as chair of CSPR.As a political fundraiser, Kristin Strohm has successfully solicited major funding from the Koch brothers. While Strohm was the finance director for Mike Coffman's congressional campaign, in which Coffman benefited from ads run by Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brother's flagship political group. Through Strohm, Coffman also received the maximum possible donation allowed by law from David KochStarboard Group lists Americans for Prosperity Foundation as a former client. American for Prosperity is also a member of Vital for Colorado, a front group that shares an address with CSPR and counts Kristin Strohm in their leadership.Starboard Group also works for the Western Energy Alliance.With Strohm at the helm, CSPR works hand in glove with the Koch political apparatus. CSPR lists \"finalizing plans for 2014\" with Americans for Prosperity Foundation as a \"Strategic Objective.\"EIS Solutions, where Kristin Strohm's husband Josh Penry is Vice President, has staffed CSPR since its inception. Dustin Zvonek, a former EIS Solutions employee, served as the original media officer for CSPR. He is now the head of Americans for Prosperity Colorado. EIS has worked for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA), the top oil and gas lobbying organization in Colorado, and Vital for Colorado. EIS was caught faking signatures for a COGA petition in 2013.Earl Wright, a member of CSPR's board of directors, attended the secretive Koch brothers strategy meeting in Aspen in 2010. Former Board Member of CSPR Kaye Fote did as well. Earl Wright is president of the AGM Charitable Gift Foundation, which has significant oil and gas holdings and finds CSPR.See this relational map of CU Boulder's ties to the fracking industry and the Koch brothers."}, {"title": "For a New Culture of Water in California", "text": "Just a year after Jerry Brown signed into law The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), the Union of Concerned Scientists has published a riveting report titled \"Measuring What Matters: Setting Measurable Objectives to Achieve Sustainable Groundwater Management in California.\"Thirty-eight compressed pages, with a clear, concise text, along with eye-catching tables, charts, photos, a glossary and a bibliography, the report was written by Juliet Christian-Smith and Kristyn Abhold with inputs from academics, hydrologists and environmentalists from all across the state who took part in a series of roundtable discussions in June and July 2015.\"Measuring What Matters\" throws down a gauntlet. From now on, no reading, thinking citizen will be able to beg ignorance when it comes to the future of water in California. While the report might be too technical for the average water user - the authors use words such as \"stochastic\" and concepts like baselines and thresholds - it provides food for thought for everyone who cares about water in California. The report is available online here.\"We are facing some of the hottest and driest conditions on record,\" Christian-Smith and Abhold write near the conclusion of their report. \"Sustainable groundwater management offers a new pathway that will allow the state both to mitigate and to adapt to climate change while also increasing water reliability in the future.\"A climate scientist who grew up in Boston and who moved to California in 2001, Juliet Christian-Smith has already lived through two major droughts. A dogged researcher and the editor of the journal, Sustainability Science, she also ventures into fields and talks to farmers as well as hydrologists. As the lead author of \"Measuring What Matters\" and a long-time student of crisis and resilience, she's perhaps the ideal expert to talk about drought, ground water, and the politics of H20.Q: Congratulations on the completion of the report \"Measuring What Matters.\" It seems like a landmark document in the story of California water.  A: Thank you. We've been briefing state agencies. I've been happy with the response so far.Q: All government agencies seem to have secrets, but water agencies seem to be more secretive than others. Do you have ideas why that is? A: Water is power. It's been the path for many cities, companies and families to prosper all across the West and in California. Books and movies have told that story. The whole water realm has been siloed and made technocratic. Only a few people in the room make decisions about a state-owned resource, though the Department of Water Resources has scheduled a series of public meetings. You can see them on the website.Q: In order to manage water we have to measure it and monitor it, don't we? A: That's the starting point. In the past we have had good, but vague goals such as improved groundwater management. Unfortunately that has not produced sustainable groundwater management. We need to do it differently.Q: The word drought appears in the report but it's not there at every turn and in every place. A: We've had panic about the drought. When it rains we might have panic about flooding. What seems certain is that we will have more extreme conditions, more drought and more flooding. Groundwater storage is essential whether we have flood or drought. Since we're losing snow pack there is only one other place to go for water and that's underground.Q: It's essential to be resilient, isn't it? A: Whatever comes along we have to be ready for it. We'll probably get drier dry and wetter wet. So we have to rethink our whole water system. In addition to prolonged winters without rain, we now know that there are massive impacts of climate change. Hotter temperatures have exacerbated the drought. We lose a huge amount of water through evaporation.Q: Your report calls for big changes, doesn't it? A: They have to do with life styles today and life styles fifty years from now. Some of the changes we have in mind are technical and scientific, but we also have to create a new culture of water. What's needed is more transparency when it comes to the politics of water. We have to move from a model of command and control to one of openness and inclusiveness and to listen to a broader spectrum of voices than ever before. Adherence to democratic principles is essential and so is collaboration. They're not explicitly stated in the report, but they're part of the background.Q: Your report has lots of details but it doesn't get into specific crops such as almonds and grapes or fish in the streams. A: We don't want to raise flags. We mean to move the conversation forward and acknowledge best practices. It's important to realize that when it comes to water we're not starting from scratch. In some place in California, people are already on the road toward sustainable water; some solutions are already working.Q: I don't think you use the term \"tragedy of the commons\" but that concept also seems to be implicit in the report. A: Forests tend to have discrete boundaries. We can see where they begin and end. But water flows between groundwater basins; we can't set standards for one without also examining standards for the adjacent basins. They all have to be managed in a coordinated way.Q: I'm more familiar with the concept of the watershed than the basin? Is a basin larger than a watershed? A: There are probably 500 ground water basins in the state. Some are smaller, some larger. Most of them incorporate multiple watersheds. When we talk about basins we're talking for the most part about valleys.Q: Reading the report and thinking about this drought of ours I was reminded of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland in which Alice says that she can't remember things before they happen. The White Queen says, \"It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.\" A: The water situation is Alice in Wonderland. The water managers are afraid of going down into a rabbit hole. We're trying to tell them that change need not be scary, that they can take a step at a time and that the world won't come crashing down on their heads.Q: You point to Australia and suggest ways that California can learn from that continent's recent experience with drought. A: We can also learn from Texas, though California doesn't like to hear that. Texas is ahead of California when it comes to statewide groundwater management.Q: The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) that Governor Brown signed into law on September 6, 2014 says we have to achieve \"sustainable yield\" - \"long-term resilience of a groundwater system\" - by 2040. That seems a long time away. Most anything could happen between now and then. A: We would like the process to be faster but the clock started ticking as of January 1, 2015. They can't be going in the opposite direction of sustainability. The trend-line needs to change, even if it's a gradual shift.Q: I think that there is more water literacy now than at the start of this four-year drought. A: There is, though I sometimes get frustrated with media stories about water. No one is reporting why we've not been prepared for this drought. That seems odd given the fact that we live in a state that experiences drought on a regular basis. There are few stories about the systems that lead to behaviors that are maladaptive. We have to look at the ways that it's all connected. We will have another drought. It's time to prepare for it right now."}, {"title": "Mobilizing the Masses Around Climate Change as We Count Down to COP21", "text": "How can we mobilize the masses around climate change? The case to act is now urgent. As you might know, 2014 was the hottest year in 130 years of systematic record keeping. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000. If this wasn't compelling enough, the symbolic Doomsday Clock moved to three minutes before midnight in January 2015 because of the gathering dangers of climate change and nuclear proliferation, signalling the gravest threat to humanity since the throes of the cold war.Should we be alarmed? It is the closest the clock has come to midnight since 1984, when arms-control negotiations stalled and virtually all channels of communication between the US and the former Soviet Union closed down.Whilst 'sustainability and climate'-related news is more commonplace in the developed nations and part of our mainstream media, even if it is lower down the news agenda, it's not the case for most of the rest of the world. The majority of the world's population is more worried about their pay packet at the end of the month and how to pay their bills rather than the end of the world (which seems a long way off unless you're living in Kiribati island -- one of the Pacific Island states that is one of the most vulnerable in the world due to the potential devastating effects of climate change that lay ahead.)Global warming as well as nuclear proliferation seem to be such abstract notions for the average man or woman in the street, to the extent that they're unlikely to show any real concern unless it makes an immediate and direct impact on their day to day lives.The enormity of these unforeseen possibilities is unfathomable within the general context of most people's lives, and it is therefore no surprise that most people become disenchanted and disenfranchised with this unknown realm of possibility. It is basically down to the fact that the problems seem so huge that no single individual feels that they can make a difference and therefore they cut the umbilical cord which connects them with the supposed prophetic events beholden in the future.It seems many people in modern societies are still devoid of any significant emotional attachment to the advancement of extreme climate change as they live out their relatively straightforward lives living in their clean houses, streets, orderly neighborhoods and functioning cities. Renee Lertzman's research into Climate Change and inaction reported in The Ecologist (Lertzman 2008) alerts us to the role anxiety can play in an apparently apathetic response.However, in the midst of all this climate doom and gloom, there are many great opportunities emerging. Although most people are experiencing extreme information overload in their daily lives and finding it difficult to process and manage, the advent of social media has allowed us to engage mass populations around climate change and disseminate the truth of our trajectory at lightning speed through online content sharing of news.Most people I know have an almost inseparable relationship with their smart phone and an insatiable desire for content, new images and captivating videos to share. We have all turned into publishers, syndicating news to our respective social and professional networks at the press of a button. The whole world of viral marketing and word-of-mouth citizen engagement is racing ahead in leaps and bounds as the 'sharing' function becomes indispensable to people's daily lives, feeding our social whims and, for many validating our existence as social citizens. This is all good news for the world of campaigning and capacity building i.e. garnering support around popular issues and creating traction. There is now a burgeoning array of online social movements gaining ground and shifting attitudes including Avaaz.org , Change.org, Sumofus.org, the Global Call for Climate Action, 38degrees and the more recent Global Catholic Climate Movement  which Ethical Team supported with their April Care4Creation campaign and its inaugural Parish Toolkits.The breadth of these organizations and their global reach is a cause for celebration in the fast moving chaotic world we occupy which now seems to be in a continual state of disarray, conflict and boom and bust economic cycles.There are also more sector specific campaigns emerging such as the new More than Scientists campaign which recently launched to provide a clarion call from the worlds scientific elite to stand up and be counted in the fight against climate change. And from Greenpeace we have the Save the Arctic campaign which seeks to protect one of the last untapped natural habitats from the ravages of oil exploration.Some of these organisations have achieved massive leaps in their membership - a case in point is Avaaz, which now has about 42 million subscribers. This is significant by any publisher's standard and at this level Avaaz's donor activation campaigns should be able to sustain them organizationally simply through the sheer numbers who are able to give small, but regular donations, alongside traditional funding from foundations and HNWIs.Another example of movement building and a sea change taking place within the world of politics is the emergence of the UK's Green Party which has now become the largest youth movement in the country. It's about time the Greens gained a foothold in the UK which no doubt spawned the impetus behind some of these new European online campaigning platforms. The green movement is in affect 'coming of age'. It's either now or never, and the future generation seem to be realizing their potential in that they have a voice through digital engagement as well as through more traditional activism. Like the Arab spring they need to embrace this social tide and embark on a crusade to ensure they have a future worth living for long after today's politicians are out of the frame.So how do we stop the silent collapse? Why are we still facing an impeding gargantuan disaster similar to many of the apocalyptic science fiction movies we've all seen over the years if we are indeed such an 'intelligent' species? Why is sustainability such a hard sell? On the one hand we are facing catastrophic and impending climate crisis and yet on the other hand we have the powerful solutions that could allow us to reduce the impact humanity has on the environment, maintain our rich biodiversity and habitats for future generations. Isn't this just about basic stewardship? Is it that hard for our elected leaders to understand? Does it really make any sense polluting our water systems that are the essence of all life on earth or the air we need to breathe? I don't think so. And yet we're still seeing governments opting for short term measures such as fracking over cleaner energy solutions that are proven and ready to scale up.Why is there so much skepticism and what's holding back the true green revolution or should we say revelation?The tipping point will be creating and engaging these mass movements. There are also lots of large captive and in some cases untapped audiences that can be mobilized further and used to promote the climate agenda including in sport, religion, universities & colleges, unions and in popular culture with celebrities. Anywhere in fact where there are existing large organized groups that can be harnessed for a greater social good with clear channels of communications for cascading ideas and sharing best practice.Let's hope that James Lovelock, independent scientist, environmentalist and futurist who pioneered the theory of Gaia isn't right. His comment on BBC Radio 4 recently said we should focus ALL our efforts on adaption as opposed to mitigation as it was just too late to make the changes necessary.So the best advice is sign up to the global campaigning platforms that are now challenging global corporations and governments so that through mass online protest we can create a fairer, more equitable and more transparent society. And let's hope that these movements pool resources and join forces to stand behind one single unified message as we count down to the historic COP21 Climate change talks this December in Paris.It really doesn't make any sense that according to a report released by Oxfam last year, the richest 85 people in the world, who could fit onto a single double-decker bus, have just as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. This shock finding from anti-poverty campaigners Oxfam came as world leaders, business chiefs and academics met in Davos for the World Economic Forum in 2014.So start your journey as an armchair activist today and start petitioning and joining these climate change campaigning organizations as there's just no excuse not to engage in 2015.__________________Iain Patton is a Stakeholder Engagement consultant amplifying the sustainability agenda.

There are now more than 580 peer-reviewed articles examining the environmental and human health harms of shale gas extraction. Dr. Anthony Ingraffea, award-winning and nationally recognized expert on shale gas extraction, has analyzed these studies and noted that, \"94 percent find harmful impacts to human health, 69 percent find harmful impacts on water quality, and 88 percent find harmful impacts to air quality.\"One of the newest reports shows what would happen if the moratorium against shale gas extraction in the Delaware River watershed were lifted and just 4,000 wells were drilled. CNA Analysis and Solutions, an independent group of scientists and researchers, determined that if these wells were drilled, there would be a cascade of negative events that would jeopardize the drinking water, air quality, forests, and health of Upper Delaware River communities.Some of the potential impacts of fracking in the Delaware River watershed include:So let's put our politicians to the test. Here's a list of environmental issues and the questions you can use when speaking with politicians to see where they stand.1. Health and Safety: Thousands of individuals have seen their health deteriorate, their drinking water impacted, and/or their safety jeopardized because of fracking wells and fracked gas infrastructure.Ask your politicians: What is your position on ensuring that people have a right to safe drinking water from their household faucets--water free of contamination and toxins from the shale gas industry?2. Property Rights: Property owners are increasingly having their land forcibly taken by eminent domain (or with the threat of eminent domain as leverage) for construction of pipelines to carry fracked gas and gas liquids. They suffer property damage, loss of property value, degradation of the land, and living in fear that a pipeline explosion or accident could cause harm to their families or themselves.Ask your politicians: Do you oppose the use of eminent domain for fracked gas pipelines and associated compressors or LNG facilities?3. Methane Leakage and Climate Change: A growing number of studies are finding that the leakage of methane into the atmosphere is more pervasive and significant than had been believed, that drilling and fracking are a significant source of methane, and that methane is 86 times more powerful than CO2 over the first 20 years for its climate-changing impacts.Ask your politicians: Given this evidence, do you agree that drilling and fracking for shale threatens the future safety of communities that will be adversely affected by the floods, drought, and other extreme events associated with climate change?4. Trans-Pacific Partnership: There is strong opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade proposal for a variety of reasons, one being it will allow companies to secure automatic approval for the export of fracked gas to foreign countries with free trade status. Another reason people oppose it is TPP will give corporations the power to challenge state and federal environmental protection laws (for example, local, state, or regional bans on fracking) that the companies claim impede their ability to make profits.Ask your politicians: Do you support or oppose the TPP?Maya K. van Rossum is the Delaware Riverkeeper, and has led the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) since 1994. The DRN is a regional nonprofit advocacy organization that monitors the river and all of its tributaries for threats and challenges, and advocates, educates, and litigates for protection, restoration, and change.For more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com"}, {"title": "The True Impact of an Apple", "text": "You're standing in the supermarket. You're in the produce section looking at apples. Organic and conventional apples are there right next to each other. They look the same. Which one do you pick?Based on all the questions I get about the price of organic, I'm going to guess many will pick the cheaper apple. We tend to live in micro moments, focused on what's right in front of us.For a minute I'd like you to zoom out to the macro. Visualize both those apples and where they came from, how they lived their lives, and the aftereffects of their production on the environment and on you.First, think about the nature of an apple. It grows on a tree and only ripens once. We want our foods to be local, but if you want that local food to be an apple, you've also got to rethink when you eat apples: in the fall.Second, think about how long those apples have been around. Many apples these days have been bred to have a long shelf life. In the olden days, when flying apples around the world wasn't an option, people planted apple trees in their backyards. When the fruit was ripe, they harvested, preserved, and made those apples into everything they could think of to keep them for as long as possible. Nowadays, lots of our apples are shipped in from places like New Zealand--where their fall is our spring--so Americans can have fresh apples pretty much year round.Third, think of how those apples have been farmed. The conventional ones have been sprayed with multiple toxic chemicals, including lots of petrochemicals. All those chemicals seep into our environment and cause long-term health and environmental problems--both locally where the apples are grown, and personally to you when you ingest the apple. The organic apple was grown using non-harmful techniques, ones still based in science, but that don't leave lasting negative impacts on the environment or your health.Lastly, think of all the taxes you pay and the charitable donations you might make to groups cleaning up the environment, curing cancer, and making the world a better place. Spending a little more on the organic apple has impacts on all of those things.That organic apple lives every moment of its lifetime better, so your lifetime will be better for choosing it. The lifetime of anyone who touches that organic apple is also better. And when we think about how we can all leave the world better, magic happens. Life becomes better for everyone.And if you're truly worried about whether or not you can afford that organic apple, plant an apple tree. Heck, even if you aren't worried about the price of an organic apple, plant an apple tree!And if you want to learn more about growing apples organically, visit the Rodale Institute.

One of them is even named Magic.Magic, who often wears a custom tuxedo, made Time magazine's list of the top 10 heroic animals in history -- here's Time's explanation for what earned this special little horse her spot:\"Magic went to visit a patient who had lived in an assisted-living facility and hadn't spoken to anyone during her three years there. But the moment she laid eyes on Magic, she said, 'Isn't she beautiful?'\"It was a moment that changed this woman's life, and was deeply affecting for the people who'd been caring for her, as well.\"The activities director was so surprised to hear the woman speak that she began to cry. She told the woman that she loved her. 'I love you too,' was the answer, her first sentence to another person in all that time,\" Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, co-founder of Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses, said. \"Magic always seems to find the person in the room who needs her the most.\"Gentle Carousel began nearly two decades ago, with a focus on bringing miniature horses to people who aren't mobile.\"People who were not able to travel but would also benefit from an equine experience,\" Garcia-Bengochea said.Garcia-Bengochea says her therapy horses are just like full-sized horses in terms of personality, preferences and intelligence.What makes them especially well-suited for this line of work -- on top of careful breeding, and two years of intensive training -- is being so adorably wee.\"While a large horse can be intimidating to a small child or a fragile senior, the miniature horses were easier for them to trust and befriend,\" Garcia-Bengochea says.It's been 20 years of big growth (not for the horses, of course; they're still itty bitty). The all-volunteer nonprofit, headquartered in Florida, now has bases in California, New York and Greece.The group has 25 miniature therapy horses, who themselves travel a lot, to be with and comfort thousands of people every year.Often, they're going places where folks have been through the worst kind of trauma. The horses helped survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting, and child trafficking victims in Washington, D.C.After the devastating 2013 tornadoes, Gentle Carousel horses went to Oklahoma. They've sat with the children of cops killed in the line of duty. This past summer, Magic spend time in Charleston, South Carolina, with people affected by the shooting at Emanuel AME Church.There's really no such thing as an ordinary day for Gentle Carousel's horses. They might be visiting hospitals or hospices, nursing homes or homeless shelters, libraries or homes to see someone who is housebound -- anywhere that people could use the kind of pick-me-up bestowed by a calm, empathetic, 2.5-foot tall, stuffed animal-like creature, whose very existence makes the world a happier place.\"These little horses bring their special love where it is needed most,\" says Garcia-Bengochea. \"Everyone of all ages seems to love the little well-trained horses.\"One of the Gentle Carousel horses, Valor, is now even working with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, to help kids and police officers relate through some really tough experiences.\"The first time a child comes into contact with a police officer, it's almost never good,\" Lt. Jennifer Seetoo told LA Weekly. \"Even if we're there to help, that means some kind of trauma has occurred.

Humans are made up of about 60 percent water and without it we start to lag through the workday. The thing is, if we drink water from plastic water bottles -- think every bottle of water you've ever taken a swig from -- we're consuming the resources of a massive amount of different industries that we haven't even considered.   Every bottle, cap, and wrapper needs to be manufactured somewhere and then put together to fill with nothing other than water for us to drink. Then, trucks need to ship all those cases of water all over the country. Let's just say, it's a lot. So how does an environmentally savvy consumer get their fill without worrying about the concern of plastic water bottles?  What is Ban the Bottle? We can look first and foremost at the San Francisco water bottle ban. The whole city cut the sale of single-use plastic water bottles to decrease the amount of wasteful plastic that the city population uses. Single-use products are, in general, wasteful and problematic.   San Francisco's ban decreases the amount of plastic that gets used, the amount of garbage that gets tossed aside, and the amount of civic and private resources that have to worry about any of the above. Essentially, it decreases the entire carbon footprint of every individual who just wants a sip of water -- and who doesn't want that?   Single-use plastic water bottles require the input of an incredible amount of energy that the everyday consumer can avoid while simultaneously getting their daily fill of H2O. So if we aren't drinking from plastic water bottles, where can we get our recommended daily amount of water?  Refillable Bottles The first and most obvious method for the everyday water consumer (read: everybody) is to use a refillable water bottle. You need to drink water throughout the day regardless of your occupation -- whether you're talking with coworkers about the latest TV shows at the water cooler or rushing from one conference room to the next, filling your own water bottle is imperative for consistent hydration. Holistic Health Coach and Wellness Author Kimberly Petrosino says, \"I have two reusable water bottles -- a large one for my workspace, which I drink from throughout the day, and a smaller one for my purse. It is not only better for the environment, but it's great for your health! Having a reusable water bottle handy all of the time makes it almost impossible NOT to drink, and you can do so knowing you're minimizing your carbon footprint.\"  Water Refill Station Like we said, single-use water bottles are wasteful and environmentally problematic. A water refill station gives you and your employees the ability to not only stay hydrated and healthy, but environmentally sound as well.   We already mentioned the refillable water containers, but what would they be without a water refill station? An easily accessible water cooler dispenser gives everyone an opportunity to get their fill whenever they need it.  Filtered Water Dispenser The last step is making sure what you're providing is what everyone wants to drink. Filtered water coolers for your office or workplace provide an outlet for everyone to fill their respective refillable bottles, chat for a bit with friends, and feel comfortable within the workplace.  In the end, it's the small acts that make up a sound environmental policy. Drinking water from refillable bottles filled at filtered water dispensers is the first and easiest step to \"Ban the Bottle.\"Written by Chris Garner in collaboration with Kimberly Petrosino.

The quake's aftershocks reverberated across South America, and sparked fears of tsunamis and earthquakes in Hawaii, California, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the Philippines.Among the victims were a 35-year-old woman killed by a falling roof and a 20-year-old woman killed by falling rocks, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said Wednesday.Additionally, 1,800 people in Illapel, Chile -- 29 miles from the earthquake's epicenter -- were left without drinking water, and hundreds of thousands in the Coquimbo region had no power, according to officials and electricity providers.The catastrophe was also the world's strongest earthquake in 2015 so far, Chilean Undersecretary of the Interior Mahmud Aleuy told a news conference Wednesday.A drone video below shows the earthquake's impact on Los Vilos, a coastal commune in eastern Chile, on Thursday:Countries along the Pacific rim braced for the earthquake's reverberations.

In the United States, pledges from 18 cities range from carbon neutrality to carbon reduction. Seattle plans to be carbon neutral by 2050. Houston commits to a 42 percent reduction by 2016 and to 80 percent by 2050 (based on a 2007 baseline). Los Angeles aims for reductions of 45 percent by 2025, 60 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 (based on a 1990 baseline).In addition to these greenhouse gas targets, the declaration also conveys intentions to regularly report emissions and to establish climate plans to reduce them.\"The commitments that the Chinese and American cities are taking ... are a very important component of our broader efforts to deepen climate cooperation and to show that ... the two largest emitters in the world are taking seriously our obligation to meet the ambitious goals that we set out last year,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to President Obama. He noted that the declaration builds on a climate change deal reached in November by Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping last year. That deal called for the United States to lower greenhouse gas emissions as much as 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. China agreed to peak emissions by 2030.The pledges come a little more than two months before nations gather for international climate negotiations Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 in Paris--a meeting intended to produce a deal that would commit all nations to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the 62 climate commitments leading up to the COP--may not be enough to keep global warming to the 2-degree Celsius threshold recommended by the United Nations, said U.N. Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres. Her \"guestimate\" of the pledges, which cover approximately 70 percent of global emissions, is that they would equate to 3-degrees Celsius of warming, compared with pre-industrial levels.Met Office Report Predicts Warmer Times to ComeThe same week researchers released a study finding that the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada has shrunk to a 500-year low, the U.K. government agency that studies global weather patterns released a peer-reviewed report suggesting the world is moving into a warming trend.Several global changes, the Met Office says, are occurring simultaneously to cause the change. One is El Nino--warm bands of ocean water in the central and east-central Pacific--which is expected to occur this year and to be particularly strong.\"We know natural patterns contribute to global temperature in any given year, but the very warm temperatures so far this year indicate the continued impact of increasing greenhouse gases,\" said Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre. \"With the potential that next year could be similarly warm, it's clear that our climate continues to change.\"Southern Ocean's Carbon-Storing Capacity Increases, but for How Long?A new study in Science finds that the Southern Ocean carbon sink has been reinvigorated, helping limit climate change. Its uptake of greenhouse gases stalled in the 1980s but roughly doubled to 1.2 billion tonnes--equivalent to the European Union's annual man-made greenhouse gas emissions--between 2002 and 2011.\"It's good news, for the moment,\" Nicolas Gruber, an author of the study at Swiss university ETH Zurich, told Reuters. But he said it was unclear how long the higher rate of absorption by the Southern Ocean, the strongest ocean region for mopping up carbon, would last. Moreover, increased carbon dioxide could be bad news for marine life because, once absorbed in water, some of it becomes carbonic acid, which disrupt shellfishes' ability to grow their protective shells.Gruber and his colleagues analyzed 2.6 million measurements of carbon dioxide (CO) concentration in the surface waters of the Antarctic Ocean made by ships over three decades. They concluded that the ocean's carbon uptake fluctuates strongly, rather than increasing monotonically in response to the growing atmospheric CO concentration. Wind and temperature changes appear to drive these shifts, which are linked to low-pressure systems in the Pacific and high pressure over the Atlantic section of the Southern Ocean.Peter Landschützer, a postdoctoral researcher involved in the study, said existing models can't predict how patterns will change in the future, \"so it is very critical to continue measuring the surface ocean CO concentrations in the Southern Ocean.\" Currently, long-term datasets are the only reliable means for determining the evolution of the ocean's carbon-storing capacity.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

And I do still have it on the camera so I can prove it.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Compassion Rising as Strategy for Climate Adaptation", "text": "On last Thursday's Late Night, Stephen Colbert interviewed Joe Biden about his son's death. It was remarkable to hear a potential presidential candidate speak so candidly about his emotions. He used the term empathy in almost every sentence. Viewers could only imagine the magnitude of his decision: to run for president, which he acknowledged would take 110% of his time and attention, or to spend time with his newly fatherless grandchildren, widowed daughter-in-law and his stricken wife.New Yorker writer Evan Osnos commented the next day that\"...it was impossible not to see, in the Biden interview, a rebuttal to Trump's moment in America--to the notion of self-promotion as success, of cruelty as candor, of empathy as weakness.\"The notion of empathy as weakness is being subverted as mainstream America develops a reverence for gentleness and compassion. You see it everywhere.I learned about the Charter for Compassion from Cynthia Figge, COO of CSRHub (sponsor of this blog) and a Council member. That charter was created in 2008 to promote dignity and respect among humans. Now, climate change has pushed the charter to extend to compassion to nature as well, allowing \"human beings to survive and thrive.\"Neuroscientist Dan Siegel credits compassion with rewiring the brain. It creates \"a flexible and adaptive way of being that is filled with vitality and creativity,\" qualities essential for adapting to climate change. Siegel specifically addresses climate change through mindfulness and meditation techniques, which he says will naturally lead us to make decisions helpful to the earth.Compassion has always been essential to our evolution. As Darwin wrote, \"...those communities, which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members, would flourish best...\" Time Magazine's Greg Griffin expanded on Darwin in his article last week,\"'Survival of the fittest' is a sham,\" which debunks the myth that American exceptionalism is based on military strength. Griffin's thesis that cooperation, not strength, is key to survival is founded in our biology: we are \"systems of cooperating species,\" where microbial cells (bacteria) outnumber our cells ten to one.We as humans rely on these interconnections and the compassion that feeds them to address society's ills. One example: Stanford's Medical School uses Compassion Cultivation Training to strengthen doctors' empathy and kindness, thereby improving patient outcomes. As part of the program, the Stanford Medical Center will also incorporate more than 40,000 square feet of gardens to connect patients with the healing power of nature.Just last month, The Sustainability in Prisons Project opened at the Washington Corrections Center to bring nature into the prisons. By making videos of nature available to prisoners in solitary confinement, prison officials intend to reduce prisoner violence, anxiety and depression. (Solitary confinement itself is being questioned for reasons of compassion.)And then there's business. With its increasing emphasis on CSR, or Corporate Social Responsibility, business addresses four buckets of sustainable behavior -- employee, environment, community and governance -- all of which fall within the rubric of compassion. India enacted legislation requiring companies with at least $830,000 in profits to allocate 2 percent to CSR activities, institutionalizing this more compassionate approach. And while poverty and malnutrition are terrible problems in India, providing its population with access to clean water and air is even more critical to survival.Even football has its compassion champions. Seattle Seahawks' coach Pete Carroll leads his team with a kinder gentler hand that includes yoga, meditation and respect for the individual. Yelling, swearing and harshness are not allowed. In 2014, his unorthodox technique brought the team its first Super Bowl championship. Carroll's compassion for his players extends to the environment as well: Four years ago, Seahawks' owner Paul Allen initiated the Green Sports Alliance with the Natural Resource Defense Council to model environmental behavior. Since then, the Seahawks have converted to clean energy and provided the means for fans to recycle and compost at games.Just as on the football field, compassion and cooperation work better than criticism and conflict, especially when applied to mitigating climate change. Donald Trump represents a dying model of power and influence, one that has led us to this precipice. We're ready for something new, albeit built on constructs as old as life itself: the evolutionary imperative to be sympathetic and the neurological requirement to be compassionate. If these qualities galvanize our reverence for nature, we just might have a fighting chance.Photo courtesy of Ruth Edwards."}, {"title": "There's an Easy Fix to Stop Oil \"Bomb Trains,\" So Why Isn't Government Requiring It?", "text": "Since the tragic Bakken oil train accident that extinguished 47 lives in Lac-Megantic, Quebec in July 2013, seven more Bakken oil trains have derailed, resulting in accidents involving large fires and explosions. We now know that oil produced in North Dakota's Bakken Shale formation is extremely volatile due to its high natural gas liquid content — resulting in the “bomb train” phenomenon.DeSmog’s new investigative video, written and produced by Justin Mikulka, details a coordinated effort by the oil industry, members of the U.S. Congress, regulators and the Department of Energy to challenge the known science of crude oil characteristics with the goal of delaying or avoiding any regulatory changes requiring Bakken crude oil stabilization, a safety measure that would protect the millions of people currently living in bomb train blast zones.Stabilization is the process that removes the volatile natural gas liquids from the crude oil, resulting in a “stable” petroleum product with greatly reduced volatility and flammability.DeSmog has reported extensively on the oil-by-rail policy battle, including an investigation that revealed the direct role of the White House in working with North Dakota regulators to avoid any requirements for oil stabilization for the Bakken crude.The success of their misdirection campaign is evident — the mainstream media is largely overlooking this critical issue when the public needs referees to ask the tough questions on this vulnerability in our crude oil by rail protocols. Yet a Wall Street Journal article this week on how to make oil safe to transport didn’t even mention stabilization.The video uses archival information from American Petroleum Institute videos, Congressional hearing testimony, news clips and more to reveal how the oil industry has avoided regulation in order to continue transporting dangerous Bakken crude by rail at maximum profit.Warning: This video contains science, humor and political theater all in one — a volatile mix indeed!WATCH: DeSmogCAST: The Science of Bomb Trains"}, {"title": "Summer 2015 Was The Hottest In Recorded History, NOAA Finds", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The summer of 2015 was the warmest on record in 135 years, federal scientists said on Thursday.The period from June through August this year registered “the highest” average temperature across land and ocean surfaces on the planet, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.During the three-month time span, global land and ocean temperatures jumped up 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20 century average, beating the record set in 2014 by .20 degrees Fahrenheit. The graph below, from the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration, illustrates how much higher temperatures are than in previous record-breaking years.Two other agencies came to the same conclusion this week. Mashable reported that data from NASA and the Japan Meteorological Agency showed summer 2015 was the warmest on record.The record-breaking heat should come as no surprise. Not only was summer of 2015 one for the books, but the entire year from January to August was the hottest in recorded history as well, according to NOAA’s data.To date, the global temperature across land and ocean surfaces has increased 1.51 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average.Rising temperatures, NOAA scientists say, are one of the greatest indicators of human-caused climate change.If 2015 continues to clock monthly temperatures higher than the average, then this year will likely surpass 2014 as the hottest ever. Last year was the warmest since 2010 and 2005, according to NOAA and NASA.NOAA scientists ran through the scenarios in a post on Thursday. The consensus: \"It is extremely likely that 2015 will eclipse 2014 as the warmest year on record,\" the experts wrote. \"The historical data suggest it would take a remarkable and abrupt reversal in the NOAAGlobalTemp time series over the remainder of the year to upend 2015’s drive toward record-breaking status.\"Lou Leonard, vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, lamented the latest data, urging world leaders to take serious action this year.“The need for action on climate change has never been more evident,” Leonard said in a statement. “It’s up to world leaders: 2015 could go down as merely another record-breaking year of warming and its costly consequences, or it could also be the pivotal year of progress in the fight against climate change. The pressure is on, and Mother Nature is turning up the heat on global leaders to deliver meaningful climate action in Paris.”Global leaders, including President Barack Obama, will meet in Paris later this year to hash out details of an international climate change accord aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

The Pope simply applies timeless truths - claimed by many - to modern problems.\"Thou shalt not kill,\" says the Bible. It's in the Old Testament and the New Testament. \"Thou shalt not kill\" is believed by Catholics, Lutherans, Protestants, Muslims, Jews and plenty of people without religion. Different versions are in criminal codes all around the world.Pope Francis asks what the commandment \"'Thou shall not kill' means when 20 percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive\" (§93). Think a minute, says the Pope. Our present patterns of consumption (and excretion) are dangerous. We are killing people right now, and generations in the future. The Pope challenges us to reconcile our behavior with the Biblical commandment.I learned that commandment when I was a kid and I've long been worried about environmental degradation. The Pope put them together for me. Next week I will thank him when he comes to DC at the Moral Action Rally on the national mall. ***The Encyclical starts with historical context that blunt accusations of radicalism. Pope Francis reminds us that Pope Paul VI warned in 1970 that \"the progressive deterioration of that which has generally come to be called the environment, risks provoking a veritable ecological catastrophe.\" In 1971 Pope Paul VI cautioned that \"Due to an ill-considered exploitation of nature, humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation\" (§4). Saint John Paul II warned in his first Encyclical that human beings frequently seem \"to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption\" (§5).But the Encyclical probes deeper than any pope, or even any particular religion. The Earth is our \"common home,\" Francis reminds us again and again. Our Earth \"is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us\" (§1). But \"this sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse\" (§2).The only solution is \"to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development\" (§13) Pope Francis wants to \"strengthen the conviction that we are one single human family. There are no frontiers or barriers, political or social, behind which we can hide, still less is there room for the globalization of indifference.\" (§52). It is a message of togetherness and unity.When God enters, it is in an anodyne fashion. \"God gave the earth to the whole human race for the sustenance of all its members, without excluding or favouring anyone\" (§93). Pope Francis brings us all the way back to Genesis where Adam and Eve were told to \"'till and keep' the garden of the world\" (§67, Gen. 2:15). But the Pope is clear that \"till and keep\" does not mean \"plunder at will\" (§2). Rather, it means \"caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving. This implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between human beings and nature. Each community can take from the bounty of the earth whatever it needs for subsistence, but it also has the duty to protect the earth and to ensure its fruitfulness for coming generations\" (§67).But the Encyclical goes beyond religion. Francis challenges the capitalist roots of the crisis:\"The principle of the maximization of profits, frequently isolated from other considerations, reflects a misunderstanding of the very concept of the economy. As long as production is increased, little concern is given to whether it is at the cost of future resources or the health of the environment; as long as the clearing of a forest increases production, no one calculates the losses entailed in the desertification of the land, the harm done to biodiversity or the increased pollution\" (§195).The particular problem is externalities: \"Businesses profit by calculating and paying only a fraction of the cost involved. Yet only when 'the economic and social costs of using up shared environmental resources are recognized with transparency and fully borne by those who incur them, not by other peoples or future generations' can those actions be considered ethical\" (§195, citing Pope Benedict, 2009).Even if business paid the full cost of cleaning up its mess, some problems are bigger than business. Pope Francis advises that \"environmental protection cannot be assured solely on the basis of financial calculations of costs and benefits. The environment is one of those goods that cannot be adequately safeguarded or promoted by market forces\" (§190)Pope Francis goes on to challenge our politics. \"It is remarkable how weak international political responses have been,\" he laments\" (§54). Indeed, \"[m]any of those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms\" (§26). He is not distracted by allegedly inconclusive proof that problems are caused by human activity. \"The Rio Declaration of 1992 states that 'where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a pretext for postponing cost-effective measures'\" (§186).The solution is two-fold, requiring both local and international attention. At the grassroots, \"[t]he local population should have a special place at the table; they are concerned about their own future and that of their children, and can consider goals transcending immediate economic interest\" (§183). But at the same time, \"enforceable international agreements are urgently needed, since local authorities are not always capable of effective intervention\" (§173). The Pope is fully aware that \"[g]lobal regulatory norms are needed to impose obligations and prevent unacceptable actions, for example, when powerful companies or countries dump contaminated waste or offshore polluting industries in other countries\" (§173).In the end Pope Francis sounds like Spiderman. \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" says the superhero. Pope Francis laments that we have failed the Spidey test. \"[C]ontemporary man has not been trained to use power well,\" he concludes. \"[O]ur immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience\" (§105)."}, {"title": "The Role Of Climate Change In Utah And Arizona's Deadly Floods", "text": "Climate change isn't what's causing the deadly flash floods in Utah and Arizona this week, but it's part of what's making them so catastrophic, one expert warned.As of Wednesday evening, at least 18 people have been killed by intense flooding near the Arizona-Utah border that began Monday, while others remain missing, including 6-year-old Tyson Lucas Black.Flooding that powerful is an example of how the warmer atmosphere turns ordinary weather events into more extreme ones, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told The Huffington Post.\"The climate change aspect of this is that the atmosphere is warmer, and for every 1 degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 4 percent more moisture,\" he explained.\"When the right weather system comes along,\" such as the storm above Utah and Arizona, Trenberth said, \"that weather system can be thought of as a device for reaching out -- quite a ways at times -- and grabbing the available moisture and bringing it in and dumping it down.\"\"Climate change is not the cause, but it is -- I’m tempted to say -- a minor contributor,\" he added. \"Even that minor contribution can be that straw that broke the camel’s back.\"Prolonged drought in Utah and Arizona, which are facing moderate to severe dryness in about 90 percent of each state, is also partly responsible for the water buildup, Trenberth explained.“In the case of a drought, the ground is often not receptive to moisture,\" he said, explaining that lighter, more frequent rains would be absorbed more easily. \"Not much of it soaks in, and it all tends to accumulate, and the next thing you know, you've got a flood on your hands.\"Such extreme floods are occurring more frequently than in previous decades, Trenberth said, pointing to flooding in Japan this week that killed at least seven people and flooding in Texas and Oklahoma in May that killed at least 21 people.Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of Penn State's Earth System Science Center, echoed Trenberth's view that climate change exacerbates these weather events when he spoke to HuffPost in May about the Texas floods.\"There are many factors that came together here -- an incipient El Niño event, and the vagaries of weather,\" he said. \"But human-caused climate change is, in many cases, the straw that broke the camel’s back, that extra fuel that takes what would have been a really bad flood and turns [it] into a catastrophic flood.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Beyond Tomorrow: Why Environmentalists Need to Get Beyond Instant Gratification", "text": "By Peter Kareiva, director, UCLA Institute of the Environment and SustainabilityHumans have at least 100,000 generations of evolution as hunter-gatherers, enduring feast and famine, acting as predators and hoping to avoid being prey. The legacy of that evolution is hardwired into our brains.But our bent toward instant gratification -- a key component of what helped us survive the environmental challenges of the Pleistocene -- may well be our undoing in the Anthropocene. Even as environmentalists.Our Lizard Brains: Just Not Interested in TomorrowWe tend to think about instant gratification as a contemporary problem, with some of us wondering what social media and an everything-on-demand economy are doing to our ability to concentrate and plan for the future.But in his recent book Misbehaving, the behavioral economist Richard Thaler reminds us that the battle between fun today and paving the way for future success has been with us for millennia -- captured well by Homer in his story of Odysseus and the Sirens.Peter Kareiva:We who care deeply about the environment need to articulate what a healthy planet will look like in 2050 and work backwards from there.And it is a battle. To describe it, Thaler and others have used the metaphor of two selves: \"the doer and the planner,\" or perhaps more memorably, the grasshopper and the ant in Aesop's fables.The doer seeks instant rewards; the planner has a longer range vision. Too often, it seems, the doer in us has the upper hand. We can trace this bias to the normal first-task-at-hand over our long evolutionary history: get all the food you need as fast as possible to stave off starvation and to avoid exposure to predators.The fascinating thing about these two selves is that experiments have revealed how \"cues\" can make it next to impossible to take the long view. One classic experiment gave 4- and 5-year-old children the choice of ringing a bell and getting one Oreo cookie now, or -- if they could wait a period of time -- three Oreo cookies.If the cookies were visible on a plate, kids typically lasted only a minute before ringing the bell and getting that instant reward (but losing out on the bigger, delayed cookie reward). Absent a plate of cookies in view, they lasted 11 minutes -- and videos of the kids show even those 11 minutes were a struggle.Lest you think this only applies to 4- and 5-year olds, a similar study was done with Princeton University undergraduate and graduate students, with not cookies but Amazon gift cards of different sizes. Unless the delayed gift card (awarded a month later) was more than 35 percent greater, the majority went for instant gratification.The Princeton study added the twist of brain imaging the subjects during their decision-making, using MRIs. Several studies have suggested different brain centers corresponding to the doer and the planner: the prefrontal cortex \"lights up\" when higher abstract thinking and planning is engaged, while the limbic system (or \"lizard brain\") lights up when some immediate reward is offered.However, the Princeton study found that offering the instant reward caused the limbic system to light up, but the very same reward offered with a delay yielded no limbic activity. Our lizard brain just is not interested in tomorrow.Environmentalism Needs to Acknowledge It's Own Lizard BrainIt's obvious what these findings have to do with sustainability. Corporations, shareholders and investors increasingly demand immediate returns on investment, often to the detriment of the environment. The average duration for stock holdings on the NYSE was six years in 1975; by 2010 that had fallen to six months. There are many short-term investors who hold stocks for just a few days (or potentially even seconds).Consumers also increasingly have fewer hurdles to instant gratification for a much wider range of goods than in the past -- and in this case marketing and presentation provide cues that make it all that much harder to say \"not now\" (just as the plate of Oreo cookies in plain sight meant the kids could barely hold out for a minute).You can hear the familiar refrain of environmentalists, complaining about all this. But we environmentalists have our own version of short-termism, our own struggles with our lizard brains that we fail to acknowledge. Too often our efforts focus on tomorrow's court case, or the single impending road/dam/factory/development we want to halt. We seek dramatic symbolic statements now, or fight for dramatic singular victories tomorrow.But what is our long-term vision for the world? What do we see for 2050, when there will be between 9 and 10 billion people?For instance, will all rivers be free of dams -- or do we have alternative plans for hydropower operations that might be compatible with people and conservation?Can the locavore or organic movements substantively contribute to feeding 10 billion? What is our alternative if they can't? How much seafood will come from aquaculture, and how much will be wild caught?By 2050, three-quarters of the world will live in cities -- what is our vision for those cities of the future, and is it a realistic vision given limited wealth and resources? And whom does that vision leave out, if anyone?I am not denigrating battles against individual environmental issues. They have been the backbone of the environmental movement. But they do not, even in the aggregate, add up to a long-term vision of what we want the world to be -- one that is more than just the word \"no.\"Peter Kareiva:Too often our efforts focus on tomorrow's court case, or the single impending road/dam/factory/development we want to halt. We seek dramatic symbolic statements now, or fight for dramatic singular victories tomorrow.We who care deeply about nature and the environment need to articulate what a prosperous and a healthy planet will look like in 2050, and work backwards from there. This will require a magical mix of inspired vision and cold hard analysis of biophysical constraints. But only that mix -- plus a commitment to inclusiveness of different values and perspectives -- can inspire others outside our tribe to join us.Figuring out how to get to that 2050 is an important part of what we're focusing on here at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA.

But if you were vegan or lactose intolerant, you were neither kind of kid.Now Annie's has changed the game with the release of a dairy-free version of its classic macaroni and cheese. It's 100 percent vegan.In fact, the company unveiled two vegan versions: One with shell-shaped pasta and a second with elbow-shaped pasta that's made from organic rice pasta and gluten-free. Both were found at Whole Foods for $2.89 a box. The \"cheese\" that makes up the marketed \"creamy sauce\" is made from a mix of pumpkin and sweet potato powders, and the sauce instructions call for half a cup of non-dairy milk.HuffPost editors had the chance to get their tastebuds on the shells. One the main conclusions: It certainly doesn't taste like the cheese sauce in the brand's dairy offerings. But with vegetable ingredients and seasonings like paprika, garlic and mustard powders, it never promised to.We used plain old almond milk in the sauce, and felt the thickening mixture looked a little scary as we stirred -- the color was a bit Halloween-y, but not in that neon Kraft kind of way. Plus, there was an unexpected spicy odor, thanks to the seasonings. Once the shells were added back into the pot, however, things didn't look so bad.Despite the fact that the product didn't taste like the mac and cheese of our youth, Annie's vegan version received mostly satisfactory reviews -- if you don't think of it as mac and cheese. A few notes from editors:Scientists who formulate vegan cheese alternatives clearly have some work to do, and the work is not specific to Annie's. There are more than 7 million vegetarians in America, of whom some 1 million are vegan, excluding all animal products including dairy and eggs from their diets. \"Once mocked as a fringe diet for sandal-wearing health food store workers, veganism is moving from marginal to mainstream in the United States,\" noted the Associated Press. In other words, Eating vegan is no longer a \"hippie\" thing to do; it's just a thing to do.Annie's has absolutely kept a watchful eye on the rising trend of this food preference, but the company isn't alone. This year, IKEA rolled out vegan meatballs. Earlier, Chipotle began serving tofu as a protein, and even White Castle added veggie burgers to its meat-heavy menu. Big cheeses (non-dairy, that is) like Bill Clinton, Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé have proudly gone public with their vegan tendencies.Mac and cheese itself has undergone some extreme changes this year: Kraft announced the removal of synthetic dyes, which altered the color of its iconic blue box cheese powder, and many gluten-free offerings have popped up on shelves. Only time will tell if Annie's dairy-free addition will keep the macaroni remodeling on a roll.Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Survivor Cat Emerges As Symbol Of Hope Amid California Wildfire", "text": "Hundreds of residents, both humans and animals alike, have been affected by a massive wildfire which continues to rage across California.

Michael Berger, Founding Partner and Vice President of Supply Chain at Elevation Burger and a Food Tank board member, will be honored with the OTA Rising Star Award at the event. And I will be speaking on a \"State of the Organic Industry Panel\" with Laura Batcha, Executive Director and CEO of OTA, and Melissa Hughes of Organic Valley.  Worldwide, organic food sales grew 170 percent to US$63 billion from 2002 to 2011. In the United States alone, eaters purchased US$35.9 billion of organic food in 2014, representing 4 percent of total food sales in the U.S., according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA). And the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that more than 3,000 farms across the nation are transitioning to organic production models.  But many eaters still don't know what the organic label means. According to a 2014 study published in the International Food and Agribusiness Management Review, 17 percent of American and Canadian consumers think organic food is also locally grown, while another 23 percent believe locally grown food is automatically organic.  Farmers around the world are not only responding to consumer demand for more organic food, but also making the best decisions for their businesses. A recent meta-analysis of 44 scientific studies by researchers from the Centre for Research on Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development shows that organic farming is not only environmentally sustainable, but also financially competitive when compared to conventional farming practices. The scientists found that despite the enormous growth in sales, organic agriculture currently occupies only 1 percent of global cropland, so there is plenty of room for further expansion of organic production.  But significant challenges and consumer confusion must be overcome in order for organic to increase significantly and benefit all eaters. Many entrepreneurs, farmers, researchers, and agricultural scientists are working around the globe to protect the integrity of organic labels and ensure continued growth within the sector. Here are some notable companies and organizations working to make organic food more accessible:  1. The Cornucopia Institute, through research and investigation, acts as a watchdog organization for organic agriculture in North America, advocating on issues that affect consumer health and tracking corporate consolidation within the sector.  2. Eden Foods, which began in Ann Arbor, MI in the 1960s, is the oldest organic food company in North America. The company has grown from a co-op to a large organic distributor, and continues to track the environmental impact of its food upstream with suppliers, through company operations, and downstream through monitoring of all social impacts.  3. Elevation Burger is one of the first all-organic fast food chain restaurants striving to meet the need for convenience while delivering more sustainable menu options. The company has restaurants stretching from Texas to Maine and has historically partnered with farmers and ranchers to sponsor certification of their herds to grow their supply.  4. Georgia Organics, based in Atlanta, GA, uses farmer mentorship programs, instructional videos, and outreach events to connect Georgia farmers to Georgia consumers and to contribute to a more sustainable and healthy food system.  5. The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) acts as an umbrella organization for organic interests across 117 nations, facilitating production and trade, promoting sustainability in agriculture, and building organic leaders' capacity through close to 800 affiliates.  6. The International Society of Organic Agriculture Research (ISOFAR) supports research for the promotion of organic agriculture by facilitating global cooperation, methodological development, education, and knowledge exchange. ISOFAR supports individual researchers through membership services, publications, and events, and works to integrate stakeholders in the research process.  7. The Kenya Organic Agricultural Network (KOAN) is the national certifying body for organic agriculture in Kenya. The organization was the result of a consultative process involving organic practitioners who created a strategic national framework.  8. The Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service (MOSES) is a nonprofit that provides education, resources, and practical advice to help farmers grow using sustainable, organic practices. The MOSES Organic Farming Conference, the country's largest educational event on organic agriculture, takes place each February in the Midwest.  9. Navdanya, which translates to \"Nine Seeds,\" represents the nine crops that are essential to India's food security. The organization works to conserve and save seeds, promote sustainability, teach healthy eating and cooking, and foster the success of women organic farmers in India.  10. Northeast Organic Farming Association (NOFA) is a network of over 5,000 farmers, policymakers, educators and food lovers that aims to support organic food, sustainable agriculture, and a cleaner environment. The group develops and promotes the distribution of locally grown, nutritious food throughout the northeastern U.S. with chapters in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  11. The Organic Center is a hub for the most current scientific research on organic agriculture and health. The Center works with academic and government institutions to fill knowledge gaps on sustainable agriculture. Currently, the Center is working to find organic solutions for new diseases appearing in citrus, apple, and pear orchards across the U.S.  12. The Organic Consumers' Association involves citizens at the grassroots level in campaigns to protect the integrity of the organic label. Based in Minnesota, the network has grown to represent 2 million online and on-the-ground eaters, advocating for their interests at every level of policy.  13. The Organic Federation of Australia is a nonprofit network that works to build organic and biodynamic businesses across Australia. The network recently launched a National Organic Intern Program to help young people get started in the organic food industry.  14. The Organic Federation of Canada brings together key players to ensure excellent standards and regulations that stimulate the growth of Canada's organic sector. The organization works on behalf of small organic producers to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are addressed.  15. The Organic Growers School, based in the Southern Appalachians in the U.S., provides practical organic education for a network of farmers and gardeners. Through the efforts of extension specialists, the organization is working to create an informed network of consumers and producers that work together to support healthy communities.  16. Organic Valley is a Wisconsin-based organic dairy company that has responded to consumer demand for family-farmed food products free of pesticides and growth hormones.  17. The Rodale Institute, through research and networking, strives to create and share the best practices in organic farming. For the past 60 years, Rodale has managed a farm in rural Kutztown, PA where the group conducts scientific studies and educates community members about the value of organic food.  18. Soil Association is a charity organization in the UK that campaigns for humane, healthy, and sustainable food, farming, and land use. Founded in 1946 by a coalition of scientists, nutritionists, and farmers, the Soil Association seeks to address the direct links between farming practices and animal, plant, human, and environmental health. They help provide solutions to help individuals live, eat, farm, and grow within the planet's currently available resources. They work closely with communities to create and inspire trust in the organic market and improve consumer understanding of organic principles.  19. La Via Campesina is the international peasants' Movement that currently represents 200 million farmers from 164 local and national organizations in 73 countries. As a grassroots organization headquartered in New York City, La Via Campesina strives to unite peasants, the landless, female farmers, and rural youth to defend small-scale sustainable agriculture on a global scale.

Yet, intractable issues dominate the agenda for the two Presidents - accusations of cybertheft, military aggressiveness in the South China Seas and currency manipulation are among the hot topics. Trade, usually the bright spot in the bilateral relationship, holds limited promise with no expected significant breakthrough in the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) negotiations. The one area that does stand out as a win-win, if progress can be made, is environmental protection.In November 2014, President Barack Obama and President Xi reached an historic agreement to mitigate climate change as part of a long-term cooperative effort to accelerate each country's transition to a low carbon economy. To meet China's green objectives, President Xi is planning to announce a highly ambitious environmental \"clean up\" strategy as part of the 13th Five Year Plan later this year, with an estimated price tag of $1 trillion annually. China does not have the necessary expertise or financial resources to implement this plan independently however. Thus, developing strategic priorities and outlining potential areas of greatest impact will be critical to the success of an effective war on pollution.As one of the most pressing global priorities, climate change could replace trade as the new bright spot in the bilateral relationship. This is a natural opportunity for the United States and China to bring their best to the table and leverage a combination of technological, financial, trade, and market expertise in seeking solutions to this pressing common problem. The effects of climate change will have a significant impact on our two economies and could potentially reshape long-term national security priorities if they lead to competition for food security, clean air and clean water. If deployed effectively, U.S. technology, know how and experience combined with China's vast market scale and ability to commercialize technologies rapidly could bring about significant reductions in China's greenhouse gases.China's building sector presents one of the biggest opportunities for high impact collaboration. Buildings account for an astonishing 40% of global greenhouses gas emissions. China is the world's largest builder, with plans for 50% of all new construction, and will hold this position for the foreseeable future. US companies such as Dow, Honeywell, General Electric and Johnson Controls manufacture green technologies that if installed could lower China's carbon emissions. Yet the largest obstacle for widespread adoption of green technologies in China has been overcoming the higher up-front costs. The long-term savings and increased energy efficiency have not been sufficient to counteract these cost concerns.In an effort to overcome this pricing hurdle and pull one of the biggest levers in the war on pollution, on September 17, the Chinese Economic and Financial Leading Group and the Paulson Institute, announced the intent to launch the U.S.-China Green Building Energy Efficiency Fund. Leading US and Chinese financial institutions such as Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Avic Trust and CDH Investments, as well as major Chinese real estate firms including Vahke and SOHO partnered with the industrial firms mentioned earlier and China State Construction the largest builder in the world.The mission of the U.S.-China Building Energy Efficiency Fund is to enable and accelerate the deployment of U.S. technology and expertise in the China market that will reduce substantially CO2 and other climate-related emissions while improving energy efficiency, promoting industrial productivity and restructuring, encouraging cross-border innovation, and creating green jobs at home and in China. Deploying energy efficient technologies will have the added benefit of reducing the amount of energy required to supply China's continued economic growth. In fact, cutting energy intensity is an integral part of China's strategy to rebalance its energy system and accelerate the shift away from a coal-based economy.The Fund will support this mission with a three-pronged approach: developing an innovative financing mechanism with support from U.S. and Chinese institutions, identifying proven sustainable technologies, and proposing regulatory updates and recommended specifications to propel the use of sustainable technologies in China.This energy initiative provides significant opportunities for American companies that are lead developers and deployers of green technologies. The Fund will help U.S. companies bridge the pricing hurdle of green building systems installation in China. And most importantly, greening China's building stock will mean greater energy efficiencies and lower global greenhouse gases - and cleaner air for us all."}, {"title": "Marco Rubio Says He's Not A Climate Skeptic", "text": "Moderator Jake Tapper asked the candidates to respond to a question on climate change that came in via Twitter.

North American monarch butterflies are in trouble. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat needed to lay their eggs and for their caterpillars to eat, are having a devastating impact on their populations and the migration phenomenon. Unless we act now to help the Monarch, this amazing animal could disappear in our lifetime.\"I first became aware of the critical situation facing the Monarch butterfly about two years ago. My wife, two kids, and I live in Santa Barbara, California, and for many years we have visited the nearby Elwood Butterfly Preserve (a coastal grove of eucalyptus trees) where every year western Monarch butterflies congregate to spend the winter. It is an awe-inspiring site to see! Thousands of butterflies huddle together in clumps on the eucalyptus tree branches. When the sun hits a clump, the butterflies take to the air in a cloud of frenzied fluttering. Two years ago we met a docent who informed us of the dramatic drop in the number of Monarchs and the challenges they face. The docent also had an actual living Monarch caterpillar with her that she let my wife and two kids and I hold. I hadn't seen or held a Monarch caterpillar since my childhood growing up in Reno, Nevada, when I would find them on wild milkweed plants. The combination of my childhood memories, hearing about the Monarch's current situation, and seeing the wonder on my two kid's faces as they held the little wiggly caterpillar, led me to decide that we needed to start growing milkweed.Since then, I've learned that growing a \"weed\" can be much more difficult than one would think. But we have managed to get a few milkweed plants established, and have seen many a caterpillar and a few chrysalises and butterflies as well. Growing milkweed can be a challenge. I've learned that a single Monarch butterfly can lay literally hundreds of eggs, resulting in a \"horde\" of hungry little caterpillars that can eat all the milkweed thus exhausting their food supply before all of the caterpillars are full size, while decimating backyard milkweed plants in the process. I've also learned that the Monarch caterpillar has a lot of natural predators, including the dreaded Tachinid fly, which can kill of an entire generation of caterpillars before any have a chance to become butterflies.The challenges I face trying to help the Monarch butterfly in my backyard mirror the challenges the Monarch faces across the United States. I've learned that it takes A LOT of milkweed to support Monarch butterflies because they can lay so many eggs. And Monarch butterflies need to be prolific egg-layers because in the wild, only a small fraction of the caterpillars will survive a phalanx of pests and diseases to turn into butterflies. Having a single small milkweed plant in one's backyard is a noble effort, but a single plant simply isn't enough. Similarly, having \"some\" remaining milkweed across the United States simply isn't enough. We need more milkweed, but unfortunately with modern agriculture, there is less. Something needs to be done. Fortunately, the US Fish and Wildlife Services just approved spending $20 million dollars over the next five years for supporting ongoing educational outreach programs and for conserving monarch breeding & migration habitat in various priority areas of the United State. While this is a noble effort to be roundly applauded and is also a great start, it should only be seen as a start. I've learned from growing milkweed and \"raising\" Monarch caterpillars that the Monarch population is not guaranteed. I'd rather not see a declining population (like we have for twenty years) and assume it will stabilize at some point and all will be well. It's fantastic that more and more people are growing milkweed in their backyards, but we need more than that. Hopefully we can come up with a way to support the comeback of this \"weed\" so the Monarch has an ample and reliable food source, and future generations of kids will get their chance to hold a wiggly Monarch caterpillar and watch in amazement as a caterpillar turns into a chrysalis, and then later emerges as a regal Monarch butterfly.image: Monarch caterpillars on my son's hand."}, {"title": "Ocean Fish Populations Cut In Half Since The 1970s: Report", "text": "A disturbing new report published by the World Wildlife Fund found that the world marine vertebrate population declined by 49 percent between 1970 and 2012.The Living Blue Planet Report -- analyzed by the Zoological Society of London and issued as an update on our oceans' health -- also found that local and commercial fish populations have been cut in half, tropical reefs have lost nearly half of their reef-building coral, and there are 250,000 metric tons of plastic in our oceans.\"Global climate is one of the major drivers causing the ocean to change more rapidly than at any other point in millions of years,\" the WWF reported in a press release. \"These findings coincide with the growing decline of marine habitats, where the deforestation rate of mangroves exceeds even the loss of forests by 3-5 times; coral reefs could be lost [to temperature rises] across the globe by 2050; and almost one-third of all seagrasses have been lost.\"Populations of some commercial fish stocks, such as a group including tuna, mackerel and bonito, had fallen by almost 75 percent, according to the study.Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, told Reuters mismanagement was pushing \"the ocean to the brink of collapse.\".\"There is a massive, massive decrease in species which are critical,\" both for the ocean ecosystem and food security for billions of people, he said. \"The ocean is resilient but there is a limit.\"The analysis said it tracked 5,829 populations of 1,234 species, such as seals, turtles and dolphins and sharks.

Mint in Miami. Rhubarb in Rio. While some of the press about the rise of urban farming suggests that it's merely the province of artisanal-minded hipsters, the truth is that done correctly and at scale, it can be a smart, sustainable, and ultimately profitable use of valuable city space that can bring farmers and shoppers much closer together.UP ON A ROOFA good deal of the credit for the urban agriculture trend goes to startup firm Gotham Greens, which has made a name for itself with three rooftop greenhouse/farms around New York City, including a very high-profile farm atop a Whole Foods Market in Gowanus, Brooklyn. Gotham Greens executives point out that cities don't have arable land, but they do have lots of available roof space, and landlords are happy to find a way to rent it out. With a growing understanding of the impact of modern agriculture on the environment, Gotham Greens sees increasing demand for responsible, sustainable food, and its methods use 20 times less land and 10 times less water than traditional farming to achieve the same output. There are no pesticides--predatory insects are introduced to control pests--and no fertilizer runoff.Gotham Greens' flagship greenhouse sits atop a Whole Foods Market in Brooklyn. (Source: Gotham Greens)In Gowanus, the company grows herbs and produce -- it specialized in basil -- and some of it is sold downstairs at Whole Foods, with a distribution distance of one single staircase. In fact, everything the farm produces is distributed within seven miles, which cuts way down on the typical 50 percent waste of America's produce supply chain, not to mention the fact that with its state-of-the-art greenhouse technology, Gotham Greens can harvest year-round.The model is so successful that the company has expanded to Chicago, where, starting this fall, it will run a huge $30 million, 75,000-square-foot hydroponic greenhouse atop a new factory opened by Method, the environmentally friendly cleaning supplies manufacturer. The goal: 500 tons of produce per year. The roof will be very heavy, but it will also help to insulate the building below. The project is designed by William McDonough + Partners, the same firm that designed Ford's massive living roof atop its Rouge River plant in Michigan.FOOD COURT COMPOSTDown in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Eldorado shopping mall is equipped with a rooftop farm that uses compost created from the food court scraps collected downstairs. Every day, 800 pounds of food waste is composted, and mall employees plant lettuce, eggplants, peppers, basil, mint, and tomatoes, which they then get to take home. The amounts of trash, landfill, and carbon dioxide are all reduced. In fact, the farmers say, the plants seem to thrive on the elevated levels of CO2 in the urban environment.CHILLY CLIMESTo confirm that climate doesn't matter when it comes to rooftop greenhouse farming, head to chilly Montreal, Canada to visit Lufa Farms, which has been operating a 31,000-square-foot hydroponic rooftop farm for four years. It grows 25 kinds of produce for local restaurants and shoppers, who can order customized food baskets for pickup, vastly simplifying and shortening the supply chain. The farm captures rainwater, recirculates it, and avoids releasing the nutrient-rich water into the city system, where it might grow algae. Despite the harsh winters, the farm requires little heat, in part because it captures warmth from the building below.One hundred feet beneath the streets of London, Growing Underground is growing produce under LED lights. (Source: Growing Underground)DOWN BELOWCan urban farming succeed even where no sunlight is available? Pretty soon, arugula, pea shoots, mustard, coriander, celery, and radishes will emerge from a tunnel 100 feet below Clapham, London, where a company appropriately called Growing Underground has taken over a former World War II bomb shelter and turned it into a 2.5-acre hydroponic farm illuminated by plant-friendly LED lights. Take a look at this video.Using 70 percent less water than outdoor farming, the farm is extremely efficient as well as pesticide-free since, as you might imagine, there are no pests down there. The farmers plan to distribute their produce only to restaurants at first, and only within a 30-mile radius to minimize their carbon footprint and to go, as they say, \"from farm to fork in under four hours.\"FARMS IN A BOXAnd if no rooftop -- or tunnel -- is available for an urban farming project, perhaps a parking spot or two will suffice. Several companies are now manufacturing mini-farms that are entirely contained within standard 320-square-foot shipping containers. Freight Farms, which began with a Kickstarter campaign in 2011, markets the Leafy Green Machine (LGM), which uses plant-optimal LED lighting, vertical hydroponic growing towers that use 90% less water than soil-based planting, and automated climate-control and irrigation to grow up to 4,500 small plants at a time and up to an acre's worth of food per year. And you don't really need to do much work. There's an app for that. The entire unit -- or several units that can be stacked to make the most of your space -- can be controlled from a smartphone.Crops in a Freight Farms container grow in vertical hydroponic towers under special LED lights. (Source Freight Farms)Cropbox offers a similar container and smartphone sensors, although its design offers just 2,800 planting spots, and the current model uses less efficient conventional lighting to grow your choice of greens, strawberries, or fodder. The company is offering the possibility of lease-to-own options and notes that the return on investment for the year-round operation could be as fast as seven months for a crop such as basil.If nothing else, urban farming seems destined to cause a pesto boom.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed.Don Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites."}, {"title": "Truth In Advertising", "text": "Erroneous claims can be found in recent television ads dealing with environmental controversies, thereby misleading the uninformed.Ideally, corrective disclaimers should follow, not with the intent of prejudging the ultimate message of the ad, but to assure accuracy for viewers as they form their response. Disclaimers should not come into play over competing claims that appear to be legitimate grounds for dispute.If only the electronic media could join to employ a disclaimer squad to counter false information in paid advertisements (such a squad would be unnecessary if there was a policy that factually inaccurate ads would not be accepted until the copy was corrected).Would advertisers who shelled out good money to communicate their viewpoint tolerate having their ads modified or followed by publicly broadcast corrections of the content? Probably not unless they had no better place to convey their message. Then again, maybe the willingness to stand corrected is not so farfetched if advertisers are truly confident of the persuasiveness of their overall message.In any event, should the media, whose professional reputation supposedly rests on public trust, be a willing accomplice to the communication of erroneous information? Does the need for advertising revenue justify looking the other way, given that the prospect of media issuing disclaimers would undoubtedly lose some prospective clients?The following are examples of some recent environmental ads that needed remediation.To help justify its retention of captive killer whales to perform in its shows, Sea World showered the airwaves with an ad claiming the animals lived as long in captivity as in the wild. Even if true, it begged the question of quality of life. In the wild, these marine mammals roam free over vast expanses of ocean. In captivity, they are confined to holding pens that amount to watery prison cells. But back to Sea World's claim. According to amusement park's own data, the average life span of female killer whales in captivity is 29 years and males 17 years. The public should know that the Park's claim of equivalency is repudiated by the more reliable National Oceanographic and Aeronautic Administration's (NOAA) statistics in which a 30 to 50 year life span is attributed to males in the wild and 50 to 100 years to females. NOAA's numbers have more credibility because of the absence of a conflict of interest.The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) electronically challenged the Obama Administration's proposal to strengthen the existing ozone standard. In its ad, NAM asked how communities could be expected to comply with a stricter rule when some of our major pristine national parks supposedly could not meet the existing standard because of natural ozone pollution. To suggest that natural ozone pollution is the sole culprit in the parks is blatantly untrue. National Park Service monitors have detected significant human-generated ozone as well as natural pollution in every major wilderness park. The absence of industry in the parks' vicinity has not benefitted air quality since wind currents carry pollutants thousands of miles from their source. Bring on a disclaimer.Nor is the environmental community's advertising exempt. Ads that identify global warming as the direct cause of severe weather events stand to be corrected. Science as yet cannot make a definitive causal linkage. What has been determined is that global warming increases the intensity of the events.Bottom line: life is complicated enough without the media further muddling the picture by knowingly publicizing factual distortions."}, {"title": "The U.S. And China Are Trying To Tackle Climate Change From The Bottom Up", "text": "Nearly a year after announcing a breakthrough joint effort to cut carbon emissions, climate negotiators from the United States and China have convened in Los Angeles to highlight local government efforts to implement the countries’ ambitious climate change agenda.The U.S.-China Climate Leaders Summit, which takes place Tuesday and Wednesday, comes a week before Chinese president Xi Jinping is set to visit Washington, D.C., and 10 months after he and President Barack Obama came to a landmark climate change agreement. In that deal, the U.S. vowed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 and China promised to lower emissions and have 20 percent of its energy needs come from zero-emission sources by 2030.This week’s meeting underscores the importance of local actions by cities, states and provinces to meeting those needs. Climate policy experts say local buy-in is a crucial element to tackling climate change on national scale.“While both countries have adopted aggressive national targets and policies, implementation must ultimately occur at the local level,” Joanna Lewis, an associate professor at Georgetown researching energy, environment and innovation in China, told The Huffington Post. “Local level cooperation can help train local government officials on innovative ways to reduce emissions, and can be tailored to the specific circumstances of the region.”Climate negotiators on Tuesday announced a partnership between 10 cities in China and 10 in California, the U.S. state that has taken the boldest policy steps by far to address climate change.“California has led the way in the United States in implementing aggressive climate targets as well as renewable energy programs, so there is much that China can learn from California’s experiences with innovative policy design,” Lewis said.Los Angeles and its partner Chinese cities Shenzhen and Guangdong ― the only cities that have so far been named in the partnership plan ― will all share best practices in constructing green buildings, promoting green jobs and expanding trade in clean energy. Local-level actions like these city partnerships are an important shift away from the “top gun manner” the two countries used to address climate change in years past, said Li Shuo, a senior climate and energy policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia.“It is virtually impossible for countries as big as the U.S. and China, if you only have one actor or one driver sitting on top, to take any meaningful climate action measures,” he said. “You need to utilize the subnational actors as well, and that’s what they are doing.”The partnership will also be an opportunity for cities in China and California to study each other’s local cap-and-trade systems, which set a limit on how much companies can pollute and lets them buy and sell polluting rights to each other. The local-level systems may could also influence each other, one study pointed out last year, as they all are developing in the absence of a national cap-and-trade program. China has said it would implement such a program in 2016 but GOP leaders in the U.S. have remained vehemently opposed to the concept.Shuo is confident China will deliver on its promise for a national cap-and-trade program, as it isn’t plagued by the same political divisions as the U.S.China doesn’t “have a polarized situation when it comes to this issue,” he said. “We have a very solid general consensus that we need to act on this issue for a number of reasons ― domestic air pollution, energy security ... There is really not a situation where you have two forces on the far extremes.”Another announcement from the Los Angeles meeting was that 11 Chinese cities now have plans to reach emissions peaks ahead of the national target of 2030, according to The New York Times. The most ambitious new timelines are in Beijing, Guangzhou and Zhenjiang, which all set a 2020 target. After that date, emissions from those regions are expected to decline.That’s crucial in a country with such vastly different economies in each region, Lewis said.“To allow the poorer provinces to continue to develop, the wealthier provinces will have to peak earlier, so that overall national emissions can peak by 2030,” she said.The Los Angeles summit could have a major influence on policymakers around the world as they head to the United Nations climate summit in Paris this fall.“The Summit represents a key opportunity to galvanize climate action before December’s United Nations climate conference in Paris,” U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern said in a press release."}, {"title": "Hispanic Heritage Month: A Time to Celebrate and Agitate", "text": "Lisa Garcia is the Vice President of Litigation for Healthy Communities at Earthjustice.Written by Lisa GarciaThis fall (Sept. 15 – Oct. 15), we celebrate the rich heritage and recognize the invaluable contributions of Hispanic and Latino Americans to the United States. Throughout the U.S., Latinos are helping to advance our economy, improve our communities and better our country.This Hispanic Heritage Month, I’m writing not only as the Vice President of Litigation for Healthy Communities at Earthjustice, but also as a proud Latina who is grateful to all those who have fought for Latinos to have equal opportunities and safe, healthy communities. I try to carry on this legacy through my life and work as an advocate for healthy and sustainable communities, especially given the continuing health disparities facing the Latino community.Seventeen percent of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic or Latino. As the largest nonwhite demographic, we number 54 million strong. Latinos are a growing influence in American society and bring an important and diverse perspective to issues we all care about, including keeping our air and water clean and protecting communities and our planet for future generations.A new poll by Earthjustice and GreenLatinos shows that registered Latino voters have a strong commitment to conservation and the environment and a genuine concern about how our environment, and the issue of climate change, impacts our families and communities. For example, 85 to 90 percent of Latinos say reducing ozone air pollution and increasing water conservation are priorities. These issues rank as top priorities for Congress and President Obama, along with passing comprehensive immigration reform.The poll results counter the prevailing narrative that communities of color aren’t concerned about the environment. In fact, the poll shows that Latinos are not only concerned about the environment, but also that they want their elected officials to be committed to protecting air, water and wildlife. And they’re willing to spend more of their own resources to ensure that happens.Perhaps, this is because we know that environmental degradation and contamination disproportionately impact Latinos compared to non-Hispanic whites. Fifty percent of Latinos live in areas where the air quality does not meet our nation’s health-based standards, resulting in higher exposure to air pollution. Latino children are at a higher risk of respiratory illnesses and related diseases, such as asthma, as well as lead and mercury exposure. Farmworkers, the vast majority of whom are Latino, are regularly exposed to toxic pesticides and other chemicals that increase the risk of cancer. In response, Latino communities are organizing efforts for environmental justice to ensure that every family has access to a healthy environment.Earthjustice is committed to partnering with Latino communities to address environmental pollution and related health concerns. We are working with a coalition of environmental, labor, health and farmworker organizations to demand that the EPA issue the most health protective Agricultural Worker Protection Standard when it finalizes the rule this fall.Farmworkers, who earn less money and have fewer resources, bear the brunt of pesticide poisonings. Since 2007, ­­­­­­­­­­­­­Earthjustice has been fighting in court to force the EPA to ban the agricultural pesticide chlorpyrifos. Chlorpyrifos is linked to brain damage and developmental delays in children and was banned for indoor use 14 years ago. In response to legal pressure, a federal judge has ordered the EPA to make a final decision about chlorpyrifos by the end of October.At Earthjustice, the nation’s premier environmental law organization, we also value diversity and the role that our Latino employees play in our litigation and advocacy efforts. Diversity is important to create lasting, meaningful change and to prepare the next generation of environmental justice leaders who have personal connections to the communities being served. As part of my leadership at Earthjustice, I have sought to increase diversity at all levels of the organization, especially through our hiring practices. We have made substantial progress, though there is still more work to be done.Earthjustice is proud to acknowledge the many contributions Latinos are making to advance environmental justice, and we hope to continue to partner with many as we jointly advance our goals. We will also continue to challenge the status quo and hire talented Latinos to join as leaders in our organization and in their communities.I recognize that we need to not only promote equitable environmental rules and statutes, but we must also embrace equitable principles here at Earthjustice to build a multicultural and welcoming organization. As we celebrate the remarkable work of Latino environmentalists, we also have a responsibility to continue the fight for equality and inclusion not just this month, but year round.This post is the first in a series celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. Earthjustice is serving as a co-presenter at the 2015 Americas Latino Eco Festival, a multicultural event that aims to unite Latino leaders in the environmental movement. The festival will take place October 15 through 17 in Denver, Colorado.Este blog está disponible en español aquí."}, {"title": "Devastated Doggie's Face Will Make Owner Rue The Day He Didn't Share His Burger", "text": "This, friends, is the jaw-drop of disappointment.Yuka, a husky who lives in Las Vegas looked like she felt seriously betrayed when her human, Julio, didn't give her the last bite of his burger.

We should take a step back and see how this 180-degree shift in policy will impact us all. Lifting the export ban would not only risk undoing recent gains in America's energy security, but would also threaten jobs, economic security and the environment.The bill -- H.R. 702 -- would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and would prohibit any federal office from imposing or enforcing the ban on crude oil exports.In terms of economic impact, lifting the crude oil ban would provide an incentive for companies to move refining offshore, which would impact jobs of the men and women employed at U.S. refineries and the communities that rely on the tax base generated from these wages. Refinery and related industry occupations are good paying, middle-class jobs. They support more than $1.8 million in value-added to the economy per employee, which translates to jobs that support families and sustain local economies and communities.Removing the ban would be bad for our environment. In 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that lifting the export ban would increase greenhouse gases and other emissions and increase the risk of oil spills. In that report, the GAO referenced a report by Resources for the Future, which estimated that lifting the ban would increase carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by almost 22 million metric tons per year. What's more, shifting refining to parts of the world with lower environmental and labor standards may result in higher carbon emissions and greater environmental impacts overall.This effort would also undermine the efforts of the federal and state governments to encourage upgrades at refinery facilities to meet new environmental standards and other investments that will lower the environmental footprint at these facilities. One such example -- the EPA Tier 3 sulfur standard rule -- will lower the overall sulfur content in gasoline from 30ppm to 10ppm, reducing asthma attacks and eliminating millions of tons of harmful emissions from the atmosphere.It's time for Congress, instead, to get to work to improve safety for U.S. oil industry workers and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This bill is bad for our economy and the environment and Congress should reject it."}, {"title": "The Dichotomy of Fashion Pervades Fashion Week", "text": "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Like a storyline from a Charles Dicken's novel, this Fall's Fashion Week was the epitome of the aristocracy living high on the backs of proverbial peasants. It showcased the most picturesque beauty and glamour while masking its fatal flaw. The depth of its brazen, unbridled excess spans the globe in the modern-day version of \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" exposing the divide between the rich and poor, consumption and finite resources, and the choice of life over death.Clothes showcased during this well-attended (estimated 7,500 attendees, 6.5 million social media reach, 275 million media impressions) week of events in this year's fashion cycle become the go-to styles for the elite. Cheaper knock-offs make their way into the fashion chain, accelerating global fashion production to the tune of 80 billion garments annually. In 2012, the fashion market was valued at $1.7 trillion worldwide, according to Fashion United. Individual fashion icons like Nike, H&M, Prada, Adidas, Zara, and Ralph Lauren are some of the greatest benefactors, as each made the 2015 Forbes list of the most valuable brands, and are collectively worth more than $70 billion.It was the age of wisdom. It was the age of foolishness. Under the veil of ignorance, consumers purchase goods while they are unaware of their source. Major clothing brands often contract with factories in developing countries to produce garments in mass quantities because labor is cheaper. Millions of garment workers work in unsafe conditions for long hours and low pay, with some making as little as $3 a day. The plight of garment workers has been brought to the world's attention due to tragedies around the globe. In 2014, three people were killed when police opened fire on garment workers in Cambodia who were protesting to gain an increase in their minimum wage which was $160 a month. It is one in a series of tragedies that have hit garment workers hard. The global backlash has prompted little change in the workplace culture of some factories that have historically permitted physical abuse of workers who questioned the status quo.While major brands have worked diligently to fight for a fair living wage and safer conditions at factories they contract to sew clothing, monetary gain supersedes social action. Some brands do just enough to make a public relations statement that they are sustainable. Often, a fair living wage is calculated using the lowest possible wages as indicators, leaving many workers in poverty.It was the season of light. It was the season of darkness. How does one judge the brands when our individual lives are often measured by our ability to consume goods? The better side of our nature shouts for justice for the disenfranchised and brutalized. Yet, the consumer within us craves the beauty of new, glamorous clothing produced in a broken system which often disregards the people who make them.Our collective global desire is for trendy, disposable clothing. Fast fashion is a quick fix to quiet the junkie within that just wants to look good at any expense. As is common with addiction, the desire for new, better, and more is never satisfied. New fashions are introduced into the global supply chain at a higher rate. This creates a drain on our planet's natural resources, including water. The real cost is far beyond the $5 paid for a Prada knock-off at the local retail store.It was the spring of hope. It was the winter of despair. Five million people die each year from poor drinking water or from water shortage. The textile industry uses enormous amounts of water. India alone uses 425,000,000 gallons of water everyday to process fabrics, according to Sustainable Communication. Beyond water consumption, water and ground pollution are prevalent in the industry, straining an already limited global water supply. Greenpeace estimates only 2.5 percent of the planet's water supply is fresh water.Links between well-known apparel brands and textile manufacturers with environmental violations related to waste water discharge have caused brands including Nike, Walmart, H&M, Levi's, and Adidas to take proactive measures and push suppliers to take corrective actions in the clothing production processes.We had everything before us. We had nothing before us. Once discarded, each item of clothing that finds its way into a landfill contributes to carbon emissions. The EPA estimates that the textile industry recycles 3.8 billion pounds of textile waste yearly, only 15 percent, leaving 85 percent to decompose. The resulting climate change from increased heat-trapping gases is creating intense and deadly conditions. US News reports that 100 million could die from climate change by 2030.Fashion Week presents an opportunity to grasp the total picture of fashion in all its beauty and deeply flawed aspects. On one end lies earth's possible destruction caused, in part, by pollution created from too many clothes. On the other end of the scale is the possibility that we develop a global commitment that the social-economic and environmental costs of fashion are overtaken by the collective expression of sustainable practices."}, {"title": "The Efficient, Stupid Market for Nuclear Electricity", "text": "The market is a wondrous place. It ensures you can drink Scotch whisky in Cape Town and Moscow, or Washington and Tokyo, if you prefer. It distributes goods and services superbly, and it can't be improved upon in seeking efficiency.But it can't think and it can't plan; and it's a cruel exterminator of the weak, the unready or, for that matter, the future.Yet there are those who believe that the market has wisdom as well as efficiency. Not so.If it were wise, or forward-looking, or sensitive, Mozart wouldn't have died a pauper, and one of the greatest -- if not the greatest architecturally -- railway station ever built, Penn Station, wouldn't have been demolished in 1963 to make way for the profit that could be squeezed out of the architectural deformity that replaced it: the Madison Square Garden/Penn Station horror in New York City.End of the lineAround Washington, Los Angeles and other cities are the traces of the tracks of the railroads and streetcar lines of yore. These were torn up when the market anointed the automobile as the uber-urban transport of the future. As Washington and Los Angeles drown in traffic, many wish the tracks -- now mostly bike paths -- were still there to carry the commuter trains and streetcars that are so badly needed in the most traffic-clogged cities.Now the market, with its concentration on the present tense, is about to do another great mischief to the future. An abundance of natural gas is sending the market signals which threaten carbon-free nuclear plants before their life is run out, and before a time when nuclear electricity will again be cheaper than gas-generated electricity. World commodity prices are depressed at present, and no one believes that gas will always be the bargain it is today.Two nuclear plants, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, Vt. and Kewaunee in Carlton, Wisc., have already been shuttered, and three plants on the Exelon Corp. system in the Midwest are in jeopardy. They've won a temporary reprieve because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) says the fact that they have round-the-clock reliability has to be taken into account against wind and solar, which don't. In a twist, solar and wind have saved some nuclear for the while.Natural gas, the market distorting fuel of the moment, is a greenhouse gas producer, although less so than coal. However gas, in the final analysis, could be as bad, or worse, than coal when you take into account the habitual losses of the stuff during extraction. Natural gas is almost pure methane. When this gets into the atmosphere, it's a serious climate pollutant, maybe more so than carbon dioxide, which results when it is burned.Taken together -- methane leaks with the carbon dioxide emissions -- and natural gas looks less and less friendly to the environment.Whatever is said about nuclear, it's the \"Big Green\" when it comes to the air. Unlike solar and wind, it's available 24 hours a day, which is why three Midwest plants got their temporary reprieve by the FERC in August.When President Obama goes to Paris to plead with the world for action on climate change in December, the market will be undercutting him at home, as more and more electricity is being generated by natural gas for no better reason than it's cheap.As with buying clothes or building with lumber, the cost of cheap is very high. The market says, \"gas, gas, gas\" because it's cheap - now. The market isn't responsible for the price tomorrow, or for the non-economic costs like climate change.But if you want a lot of electricity that disturbs very little of the world's surface, and doesn't put any carbon or methane into the air, the answer is nuclear: big, green nuclear. -- For InsideSources.com"}, {"title": "This Republican Wants To Restore Some Sanity In His Party On Climate Change", "text": "WASHINGTON -- An insurgent group of House Republicans is pushing for action on climate change.Rep. Chris Gibson (N.Y.) is leading the effort on a resolution calling for attention to be paid to climate change and released the measure Thursday. National Journal reported earlier this week that the resolution was forthcoming.\"This is a call for ac­tion to study how hu­mans are im­pact­ing our en­vir­on­ment and to look for con­sensus on areas where we can take ac­tion to mit­ig­ate the risks and bal­ance our im­pacts,\" Gib­son told the magazine.\"[I]f left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have the potential to adversely impact all Americans,\" the resolution states, \"hitting vulnerable populations hardest, harming productivity in key economic sectors such as construction, agriculture, and tourism, saddling future generations with costly economic and environmental burdens, and imposing additional costs on State and Federal budgets that will further add to the long-term fiscal challenges that we face as a Nation.\"If passed, it would commit the House to \"working constructively\" to \"create and support economically viable, and broadly supported private and public solutions\" to climate change.So far, 10 other House Republicans have joined him: Ry­an Cos­tello (Pa.), Car­los Cur­belo (Fla.), Robert Dold (Ill.), Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Richard Hanna (N.Y.), Frank LoBiondo (N.J.), Pat Mee­han (Pa.), Dave Reich­ert (Wash.), Ileana Ros-Le­htin­en (Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.).\"As an Eagle Scout and Scoutmaster for many years,\" Dold said, \"I know firsthand why we must all work to strengthen conservation programs and other policies that promote public health, protect our environment and keep our air clean. Climate change is occurring and human contributions to this change are important to acknowledge and understand. Protecting the environment is not a partisan issue, which is why we must work together to find a sensible path forward that improves our planet for future generations.\"Gibson is seeking more Republican support for the measure.The resolution comes ahead of Pope Francis' address to Congress next week, where he is expected to touch on climate change, and his recent encyclical on the environment. Gibson, a third-term congressman, is Catholic. He has been working to get his colleagues to acknowledge climate change for some time.\"I still think we can bring for­ward con­ser­vat­ive solu­tions to this, ab­so­lutely, but we have to re­cog­nize the real­ity,\" Gibson told National Journal last year.Republican leaders in the House have been generally hostile to even acknowledging climate change and have worked to undermine the Obama administration's efforts to address it.This post has been updated to include portions of the resolution, a statement from Rep. Robert Dold and a mention of Rep. Frank LoBiondo.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Extinction or Survival? The Race Is On", "text": "Our stories can save or destroy a species. And pictures can make us see our world, as if for the first time. Before the formidable new documentary film Racing Extinction by Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos opened this week, people had already stopped dead on Manhattan streets, gazing up in amazement: Across a shimmering blue Empire State Building, swims a hauntingly triumphant humpback whale; a golden-eyed tiger stares down at strolling city dwellers; a fuchsia-flamed tropical bird fans his wings on the United Nations building; prowling the streets like a big cat, a famous female \"carbon-free\" race car driver, Leilani Munter, casts Star Trek-like hologram deck images of a blue whale facing her zebra-striped electric car.Photo credit: Getty images for \"Projecting Change: Empire State BuildingThe effect of these animals stunningly alive--racing, winging, and swimming as if they always belonged on our man-made architecture--viscerally restores some balance and truth: We are not here alone on our man-made islands; we are an integral, and too often devastating, part of a much wider natural web.\"When you're talking about losing all of nature, it's not a spectator sport anymore,\" says director Psihoyos. \"Everybody has to become active somehow. The idea is to inspire people.\"Racing Extinction does deeply inspire. It also amazes, alarms, awakens, and calls us to action. Like The Cove, this documentary is edge-of-the-seat suspense as we follow Psihoyos, marine activist Shawn Hendrich, and an Australian wildlife photographer, in daring covert operations to expose the thriving $20 billion yearly illegal wildlife trade.\"Just about everything endangered in the world is for sale in China,\" says Psihoyos. But the United States is the second biggest consumer of endangered species--from illegally fished Omega-3s or whale shark oil to ivory poached for U.S. hunter's guns and knives. \"Stop the demand. Stop the supply,\" explains Psihoyos.In a \"sting\" covert operation in Hong Kong--what Henriks calls \"the Walmart of endangered species trade\"--we witness rooftops strewn with thousands of sawed-off shark fins; in a U.S. restaurant, the film's undercover crew documents the flagrant sale of illegal whale meat; in Indonesia, we witness hundreds of delicate manta ray fins, dried and piled up like so much trash in bloody alleyways. In a truly poignant underwater shot, we see a white shark vainly trying to swim without fins. About 70 million sharks are killed each year, says Psihoyos; and one-third of all shark species are extinct.\"What if you could see how shark fin soup is made?\" asks the film's Wild Air.org viral video, featuring NBA's star, Yao Ming. After this video went viral in China, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments banned the soup from official functions; consumption of shark fin soup is down to 70% in China. But shark fin sales in Peru are still on the rise with 15,000 dolphins killed every year because they are used as bait. \"When the buying stops, the killing can, too,\" concludes Ming.The moral power and splendor of this film is that it doesn't evoke despair or compassion fatigue. It challenges and empowers us to get involved. Opening night in Seattle, our audience gave Racing Extinction a heartfelt standing ovation and raised money for Initiative 1401, Save Animals from Extinction.Photo credit: Getty images for Projecting Change: Empire State BuildingThough some of the undercover imagery of the illegal wildlife trade drew a collective sigh from our audience, we also gasped at the almost overwhelming beauty: a blue whale's prismatic rainblow streams out a double blowhole like a baptism; a brown sparrow's fluttering feathers betray tiny heartbeats; manta rays glide out over our heads, their fins wide to embrace us all.When Shawn Henrich encounters a manta ray trapped by fishing line, he dives two times to gently remove the sharp nylon line and hook gouged in the manta's head. As Henrich places both hands on the dark rays shoulders, he exchanges a long gaze with this sentient fellow mammal. \"The manta knew I was trying to help.\"Such blissful reveries in Racing Extinction balance the sight of this same creature speared to death in an Indonesian fishing village, the \"ground zero for manta rays,\" says Henrich. The false Chinese folklore that manta ray gills heal cancer was driving this village's commercial slaughter of this graceful creature. In a panel discussion after the screening, with Psihoyos and U. of Washington's Sam Wasser, Hendrich tells us what the film did not show: Not just one manta was killed that day, but 16. On the bloody beach, littered with hacked up chunks of manta rays, someone pulled a tiny fetus from a pregnant female and threw it around \"like a Frisbee.\"When Hendrich's expose of this carnage also went viral, Indonesia created the world's biggest manta ray sanctuary in 2014; a government review documented that a single manta ray was worth one million dollars in tourism revenue over its lifetime. Now, tourism thrives in this now popular \"Coral Triangle.\"The filmmakers returned to the Indonesian village that was destroying generations of manta rays, with a 27-foot screen for a community that has never seen a screen larger than a cell phone. Children gaze up in wonder at the video of soaring manta rays. \"These children don't have to be killers,\" Hendrich says, \"They can be researchers and guides.\" Eyes riveted on the manta ray flying underwater, a village fisherman says softly, \"They dance. I thought they were just fish. But . . . they dance.\"Yes, other animals are also dancing--and singing. By telling the story of these crimes against and triumphs for endangered species, can we change the ending? Can we truly bear witness and prevent the death of our world's oceans? Can we avert the first mass extinction since the dinosaurs? \"If we don't have healthy oceans,\" concludes Psihoyos, \"we don't have a planet.\"\"Choose one thing,\" the film encourages.

Parents of children in the second group were also encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities on the weekends.In total, almost 2,000 first-graders, with an average age of almost seven years old, were included.After three years, 30 percent of the outdoor activity group had developed nearsightedness, compared to almost 40 percent of kids in the control group, according to the results in JAMA.That means kids who spent more time outside were 23 percent less likely to develop nearsightedness, the authors write.The study doesn’t investigate why time outdoors might protect eyesight, but He said that some experimental work suggests brighter outside light affects eye growth in a way that inhibits myopia.To maximize the benefit, schools in China should increase outdoor time further, including recesses, and encourage parents to bring children outdoors over the weekend, he said.“One issue that needs to be addressed is the potential skin and eye damage from UV exposures, but these can be managed by standard UV protection measures,” He said.“Future studies should include information about the content of the additional outdoor activity, if the activity could be standardized, and how it differs from other studies,” Dr. Michael X. Repka of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore writes in an accompanying editorial.“Establishing the long-term effect of additional outdoor activities on the development and progression of myopia is particularly important because the intervention is essentially free and may have other health benefits,” but parents should understand that the magnitude of the effect may be small and may not be permanent, he writes.Spending time outside also involves focusing on more distant objects, one assumes, which may play a role in addition to sunlight exposure, Repka told Reuters Health by email.“The effect is very modest and should not be overstated,” he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1Lw9F5U and bit.ly/1US8fgD JAMA, online September 15, 2015."}, {"title": "12 Types Of Seafood That Are Utterly Terrifying Before Being Cooked", "text": "If the old saying \"you are what you eat\" held any truth, we would be some scary looking mother fu**ers.We apologize for the crass language, but when taking a look at what some of the most common types of seafood actually look like when living in their natural habitat -- ones that many of us eat often -- we were shocked (and a little impressed).

As a result, the students become a sort of “vigilante” group protecting their peers.A number of factors have contributed to the region becoming a trafficking hub.The rising sea level in the region -- especially after the devastating Cyclone Aila hit the islands in 2009 -- has been responsible for repeatedly destroying locals’ homes and farmland in what Reuters described as \"everyday disasters.\"The situation has made families increasingly desperate for economic opportunities, causing them to send their children -- both boys and girls -- away to find work in a city.In other cases, families ignore their suspicions of attractive young men who arrive in their community promising marriage to their daughters only to later sell them into sex trafficking, Reuters' Aditya Ghosh described in a May 2015 story.\"They are very easily misled by traffickers and agents lurking around, who promise a fantastic life in the cities, the kind that the mainstream media project,\" Bankim Hazra, Sundarban Development Board chairman, explained to Ghosh.But Save the Children's program is having results.According to PRI, trafficking cases in those villages have been practically eliminated. The group has also set up child protection committees to serve as liaisons between communities and mainland police and are also looking to start community banks to help families finance repairs to flood-damaged homes.Still, challenges remain and the problem is massive. The practice of trafficking is so widespread in the region that India’s West Bengal state, of which the Sundarbans are a part, is leading the country in reported cases of human trafficking and was home to almost 40 percent of the entire country’s cases, according to a 2013 National Crime Record Bureau report cited by the Indian Express.As reported by Reuters, over 30,000 adults and children in the region were reported missing over the past 10 years of available data, a number considered by victim advocates to be an underestimate because fears of community stigma cause many families not to report their cases to police.It wasn’t always this bad. According to a 2013 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, West Bengal has seen a 23-fold increase in the number of missing children and a 33-fold increase in missing women between the years 2001 and 2010.Meanwhile, the West Bengal government plans to help Save the Children scale up its education program to serve more villages, PRI reported. Earlier this summer, the government also announced the creation of a vocational program aimed at helping rescued trafficking victims get back on their feet.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "School Gardens Are Helping The Developing World Take On Hunger", "text": "Christian Science Monitor: School Gardens Fight Hunger In Developing CountriesWhile significant progress has been made on food insecurity worldwide -- there are 200 million fewer hungry people around the world compared with 25 years ago -- some 790 million people still do not get enough to eat, and an estimated 3.1 million children worldwide die of malnutrition each year, accounting for about 45 percent of all child deaths in 2011.One strategy to tackle the ongoing issue of world hunger, particularly in developing parts of the world where less progress on food insecurity has been made, is the proliferation of school gardens, argues a story on the Christian Science Monitor’s Change Agent blog platform published earlier this month.In the post from Global Envision, a blog partner of the platform, Maya Rait argues that school gardens increase awareness of healthful, more nutritious eating and help dispel the myth that fresh fruits and vegetables are “poor people’s food” compared with the highly processed fast foods that are becoming increasingly available globally.In addition, Rait points to research showing that school gardens can improve students’ understanding of and attitudes toward the environment. Other recent research has shown that school gardens can encourage students to exercise more as well as improve their test scores.Among of the examples of a successful school garden program outlined in the story is the EduPlant initiative in South Africa, which supports the efforts of schools attempting to get new gardens off the ground.

But the way that pop culture sometimes portrays cats has real-life negative consequences for our feline friends.\"The idea that cats are uncaring 'evil' animals feeds into cruelty -- kids tying firecrackers to their tails, for example,\" anthrozoologist John Bradshaw told The Huffington Post.Other myths -- like the idea that cats can be left home alone for days on end -- may lead otherwise well-meaning individuals to give their pets less than great care.Let's dispel a few frequently repeated myths about cats.Myth #1: Your cat doesn't like you.OK, we can't speak for your cat purrrsonally -- it's possible he hates you. But the claim that cats don't feel affection for their owners has more basis in stereotyping and sensationalistic media reports than reality.This notion resurfaced last week with the publication of a British study suggesting that in unfamiliar situations, cats don't see their owners as a source of safety in the way that a human child might see a parent. Misleading headlines on this topic ranged from \"Your Cat Doesn't Care About You\" to \"Your Cat Hates You,\" but that's not what the study said at all.What most articles left out was that the study had absolutely nothing to do with affection. From LiveScience:Ask any cat person, however, and they would swear that Mr. Whiskers does love them. They may be right, [lead researcher Daniel] Mills said. The new findings simply mean cats don't see their human companions as parent-like figures. For instance, in the Strange Situation test, parents don't form a secure attachment to their babies because they don't see their children as a \"safe base\" -- but it would be wildly inaccurate to say that parents don't love their kids. It may simply be that feline-human love is rooted in something other than dependence.Notably, other scientists in 2007 used the exact same experiment to determine \"attachment\" and concluded that cats' behavior was \"consistent\" with that of \"children attached to their mothers.\" Another study in 2011 found that cats and their owners have relationships that \"mirror human bonds\" and that cats form complex social relationships with their owners.Bradshaw noted that cats are more likely to express affection when they \"are on what they perceive to be safe ground.\" Signs of affection include \"raising their tails upright when they see us, rubbing their heads or flanks on our legs, licking us when they're sitting next to us [and] purring when we stroke them,\" he said.Myth #2: Cats aren't social.Since cats aren't pack animals in the same way that dogs are, people often have the misconception that they're total loners. But it really varies by cat, said certified cat behavior consultant Marilyn Krieger.\"Every cat is an individual, with her own history and personality,\" Krieger told HuffPost, noting that cats \"can form strong bonds with each other\" and that such bonded pairs should \"never be separated.\"Anecdotal evidence suggests cats can also form strong bonds with other species.Since they are territorial, Krieger said, it's crucial to introduce cats to each other gradually to avoid conflict. And while many cats get along well with their fellow felines, Krieger noted, \"some cats just don't do well with other cats [and] would rather be the queen or king of their households.\" But even those cats need environmental enrichment, like toys and places to climb, as well as social interaction with their humans, she said.Myth #3: You can leave your cat alone for days at a time.\"[Cats] shouldn't be left alone all day and night without someone checking on them, interacting with them and cleaning their litter boxes,\" Krieger said. In other words, if you're going out for more than 24 hours, hire a cat sitter or enlist a friend to check in on Fluffy.Krieger explained that cats can be left home alone while their owners are at work or out for relatively short periods, but they need things to do while the people are gone.\"During the day, while their owners are at work, they need plenty of environmental enrichment, such as toys they enjoy batting around, high places to climb, things to scratch,\" she said. She also recommended creating \"treasure hunts\" by hiding treats around the house for the cats to find. \"Make the cats work a little for their food and make it fun,\" she said.And how do you know if your cat is getting too lonely?Telltale signs are a cat that's become lethargic or overly clingy, started to groom itself excessively or begun to have trouble with the litter box. But she warned that all of those behaviors can also be caused by medical problems, so check with a veterinarian to make sure everything is OK.Myth #4: Your cat will likely give you schizophrenia or cause a miscarriage.Every few months or so, it seems there's a flurry of new articles warning of the dangers of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite sometimes found in cat feces. Research has found a correlation between T. gondii infections in humans -- which most commonly result in mild flu-like symptoms in healthy people -- and developing schizophrenia. Additionally, a pregnant woman who contracts the parasite can pass it to her fetus, potentially causing a miscarriage.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't recommend that pregnant women, or anyone else, give up their cats. Instead, the CDC advises thoroughly washing your hands after changing the litter box and using gloves if possible.Since cats can only contract the parasite in the first place by eating contaminated raw or undercooked meat or consuming an infected rodent, the CDC also recommends keeping your cat inside and keeping its paws away from raw meat. Because the parasite is only infectious from about one day to five days after the cat excretes it, changing the litter box daily cuts way back on your risk as well.The CDC notes that cat feces are hardly the only source of T. gondii. People can catch the parasite from eating undercooked meat themselves. And they can get it from contaminated soil, which is why you should thoroughly wash vegetables and fruits before eating them and clean your hands after gardening or digging in the dirt.Myth #5: Cats can't be trained.Have you seen the cat circus? Animal trainer Samantha Martin's troupe of traveling felines that play musical instruments, jump through hoops and skateboard will convince any naysayer that cats can indeed be trained.Martin told HuffPost in July that training a cat takes a little more patience than training a dog, but said that \"any cat can be trained to do something.\" The only reason people think of cats as untrainable, she said, is that nobody really tries to train them.Both Martin and Krieger recommend clicker training, which involves making a sound with a clicker at the exact moment a cat performs a desired action and then rewarding the cat with a treat. The clicking sound serves as an \"anchor\" to alert the cat to the specific action that you're rewarding.Both women also describe clicker training as a way to strengthen your bond with your pet, provide mental stimulation and curb bad behavior.Krieger added that the idea that a cat's behavior is set in stone is one of the most detrimental cat myths.\"The belief that their behaviors can't be changed often results in cats being surrendered to shelters, euthanized or made to live outdoors,\" she said. \"Although behaviors such as litter box avoidance, aggression and furniture scratching are not pleasant to live with, they can be changed through a combination of behavior modification and simple changes to the environment.\"Don't think that you have to be a professional to train a cat. This reporter tried Martin's clicker training tips and had her cat giving high-fives in no time."}, {"title": "The Luxurious Poop From These Tree-Climbing Goats Produces Argan Oil", "text": "Nope, your eyes aren't going baa-d. What you're seeing here is indeed a tree full of goats.This video was taken in southwestern Morocco by photographer Michael Chinnici (who leads Moroccan photo tours, so you can see and capture this magical sight yourself!).It shows the country's famous goats, who climb high into argan trees to eat fruit and leaves. Fun fact: As much as 84 percent of the goats' diet can be fruit and leaves, according to a study in the journal Small Ruminant Research.The goats then poop out undigestible seeds -- which are collected, processed and turned into very expensive cosmetics and food.At least that's the traditional method. According to some sources, in response to increased demand for the product, argan oil is mostly manufactured by hand now, in large part by all-female argan oil cooperatives.“This way is harder but the quality is better,” one such worker, Aicha Amsquine, told the Global Post. “And you don’t have to touch anyone’s crap.”Allow a little digression: The focus on tree-climbing goats tends to be on how cute they are (i.e., very), and how interesting it is that something so valuable -- argan has been called the world's most expensive edible oil -- pops out of their behind.Professor Travis Lybbert, from the University of California, Davis, looked at some of the nerdier aspects of argan oil. Like what a growing market for the oil does to a Moroccan household's finances, and what the goats are doing to the environmentWhat Lybbert found is that the economics of argan oil are very complicated, but that participating in the argan oil market tends to make a family richer and presents important opportunities for women and girls.The downside to this economic boon is that it leads to families buying more tree-climbing goats, which can be very bad for Morocco's argan forests.Here's how UC Davis put it in a media release:\"As households benefit economically, they often purchase more goats. Goats are the primary threat to the argan forests because they climb the trees to graze their leaves.\"If processing argan oil by hand means the buying and herding of fewer goats, you might think this would lead in turn to fewer goats in trees. Clearly, a scenario that would be a net negative for the amount of whimsy and delight in the world. But, you would think, better for the trees.Alas, not so. Lybbert tells The Huffington Post that the goats aren't merely cute cogs in the argan oil-making machine.Rather, families buy them as \"the primary store of wealth\" -- living, breathing, tree-climbing (and ruining, sometimes) commodities that can be sold or eaten, if not otherwise useful, he explained.And Lybbert found that even absent goats, human beings also resort to environmentally unfriendly argan harvesting techniques, that are bad for the forests.\"Microlevel evidence suggests that the [argan] boom is benefiting some locals,\" he writes in his paper, \"but it has altered forest exploitation by increasing short-run fruit collection incentives rather than long-run concerns of forest sustainability.\"What now? Well, maybe Moroccan kids and tourists together can help fix this problem, at least a little bit.These tree-climbing goats are such a unique draw that eager visitors will travel from all over to come see them up on high.But children, which is to say human kids, are doing their parts for both the economy and the environment by keeping the goats grounded -- until the tourists pay up.Only then will these adorable, economically interesting, ecologically compromising ungulates be let back to nibble away up in the trees, and then produce that precious, precious poop.More down on the ground, Lybbert said he's also heartened to see other countries, like Israel, dipping their toes -- if not their goats -- into argan tree growing and oil production, which may lead to the development of some more sustainable practices.Definitely check out more photos and videos of the tree-climbing goats on Michael Chinnici's website.And get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you have an animal story to share!"}, {"title": "Colorado Gets A One-Day Tax Holiday On Pot", "text": "Colorado residents can buy recreational pot mostly tax-free Wednesday, thanks to a confluence of state laws and higher-than-expected overall tax revenues.The state is suspending the 10 percent sales tax and 15 percent excise tax on recreational marijuana on Sept. 16, although some other fees, including local taxes and a regular 2.9 percent sales tax, still apply.

While the state's tax on the drug didn't bring in quite as much money as projected, overall tax revenue was higher than expected. That means Colorado has to refund the money from any new tax -- like the one on pot -- and revert that tax to zero. While the status of the refund depends on a vote later this year, legislators are dealing with the latter requirement by designating Sept. 16, the day after last fiscal year's records are finalized, a tax holiday.

Through animal care, compost windrow builds, and now the fledgling Soil Start Farm, Earth Matter connects island visitors and an average of 2000 (!!) volunteers a year with Ma Earth's magical cycle of transforming organic \"waste\" into rich, nourishing compost. (For tickets to Earth Matter's upcoming Farm-to-Table Brunch Fundraiser on 9/20, click here!)Governors Island, reachable only by ferry from the southern tip of Manhattan or Brooklyn Bridge Park, is burgeoning as a warm-weather destination for art, music, food and revelry. Covered in sprawling lawns, carless walkways, and stunning views of the water, city, and Lady Liberty herself, the former military and Coast Guard base is now a bucolic escape for nature-starved New Yorkers who crave sun drenched splendor in the grass. Year round, it is also home to research and educational groups like Earth Matter, the New York Harbor School and The Governors Island Teaching Garden run by Grow NYC.Earth Matter plays a vital role in reducing the island's carbon footprint, composting all of the landscaping trimmings produced on the island. The group also partners with The Trust for Governors Island and onsite vendors to green special events, managing the source separation of waste and composting all food and compostable serviceware.As if that wasn't enough, the Earth Matter team is one of a handful of city organizations that process residential food scraps in collaboration with the NYC Department of Sanitation's NYC Compost Project and Grow NYC. Each month, they receive a whopping delivery of thirty-two thousand pounds of food scraps collected from New York City residents at four Grow NYC greenmarkets in Brooklyn (currently the organization hosts 40 collection sites city-wide). Working with their team of apprentices and volunteers, Earth Matter uses the scraps to feed their animals, supply the various systems in their Compost Learning Center, and build aerated static compost piles that turn those scraps into black gold.A MAGICAL MENAGERIEI started volunteering with Earth Matter several years ago because I was drawn to the chickens, rabbits and goats. Aggressive squirrels, threatening rats, and dive-bombing pigeons made up most of my wildlife interactions in NYC, and I longed to be around creatures more friendly and fun.Over the course of a morning, I fed chickens and rabbits, mucked out their living spaces, and helped turn the contents of a hot, steamy compost bin. (Because it was winter, I didn't get to meet the baby goats, who are only with Earth Matter during warmer months.)Animal Care days have brought many educational, corporate and volunteer groups to the Compost Learning Center. Guests have included the Staten Island Coast Guard and the Friends Seminary School.\"Our partnership with Earth Matter has opened doors for our volunteer base to give back to local communities in a brand new way,\" says Julia Loehle, Manager of Community Programs at New York Cares. The group has an ongoing animal care work day scheduled with Earth Matter. \"Taking care of animals on a farm set against the backdrop of the city's skyline while learning about and contributing to the composting cycle has shown to be a unique and enjoyable experience for our volunteers.\"MOUNTAINS OF FOOD WASTEAnother popular Earth Matter volunteer opportunity is building compost windrows. This transformative experience is packed with eye-, mind- and bicep-popping wow-factor.Windrows are basically giant compost piles on steroids, built all at once for batch composting. When first constructed, each windrow is about 7 x 14 x 70 feet. With the help of a skid steer loader, the compostables are mixed and placed over pipes that help circulate air through the pile -- a vital component in the composting process. Eventually, the piles reduce to thirty or forty cubic yards of gorgeous compost, which is then used to nourish the island's verdant landscape.Dressed in muck boots and an Earth Matter apron, I joined about dozen other volunteers and Earth Matter staff for a windrow build one fall. Together we opened tubs that held fourteen thousand pounds of food waste, poured them out onto a vast stretch of woodchips and leaves, and raked it into manageable layers. To help speed decomposition along, we chopped up clunky whole items such as pumpkins and grapefruits to increase surface area for microbial activity. We then washed and restacked all of the bins to ready them for a fresh load of scraps.Unlike the fuzzy, feel-good reaction I had to my animal care experience, I felt a complex mix of emotions during the windrow build. The physical act of dumping out fourteen thousand pounds of food scraps was shocking, humbling, worrying and a source of hope all at the same time.Most of the scraps were peels and trimmings, but some of the produce was so heartbreakingly pristine I wanted to reach down, grab it, and take a bite. From the point of view of a farm animal, I imagine the entire spread looked like a beautiful, heaping buffet -- so much more tender, juicy and nutritious than what most feedlot livestock are forced to guzzle down.One third of all the food in the world is wasted each year, and seeing a tiny fraction of what gets discarded provided a sobering glimpse into the larger issue. Still, I was thrilled to see this much food waste diverted, the result of individuals opting into a green alternative to throwing it away.It's astonishing what a collective effort of like-minded people can accomplish, one banana peel and tea bag at a time.SOIL, SEEDS AND AN EDUCATIONAL FARMThe Soil Start Farm, Earth Matter's newest endeavor, aims to close the loop on the organics cycle at the heart of their mission.Housed on 3000 square feet, the farm is an educational training space that utilizes compost to grow flowers, herbs and vegetables. Open to the public and tended by volunteer farm cooperators, the space allows for experimentation with a range of organic soil and gardening practices. A share of greens -- delights such as broccoli, collards, swiss chard and basil -- goes home with each volunteer at the end of a work shift. Some of it also goes to vendors on Governors Island, who can serve it freshly harvested in their gourmet fare.\"We have amazing trainees and cooperators, fifteen this season, who each hoe a row and are learning about their particular veggie, herb or flower,\" says DeDemonicis, who hopes the farm will one day grow large enough to host a CSA in downtown Manhattan. \"We are inspired by the excitement they bring to their learning experiences, the wonder and inquisitiveness in their discovery. Their support of one another is deep and heartfelt, and we couldn't do any of this without them.\"To learn more about Earth Matter and their upcoming Farm-to-Table Brunch benefit on Sept. 20, visit Earth Matter's website.To learn more about urban and community composting, check out \"Compost City: Practical Composting Know How for Small Space Living.\"This story was originally posted on The Compostess blog."}, {"title": "Renewable Energy Moves Ahead in Russia", "text": "While many areas of Russia will probably remain dependent on gas and coal for the foreseeable future due to central plant energy distribution, there are plenty of communities in Russia where renewable energy make economic and environmental sense.

Continuing with Renewable Energy Rises in Russia , the issue is what is next? Taking the \"agile system\" strategy whereby nations and states or regions have their own central power systems, yet there is also the need distributed or local and community power is becoming a global strategy for governments and decision makers.Consider solar. Russia may have the image to people around the world as a \"cold dark place,\" but in fact several Russian regions lie south of the 51 parallel, the latitude of London. If the UK can have a thriving solar market, why not Russia? Russia's continental climate means dry clear summers where some areas get 300 sunny days a year. In mountainous regions like Caucasus and Altai, high elevations mean greater exposure to solar radiation. Even Russia's cold climate is a positive side: solar panels tend to work better at lower temperatures. As we mentioned in the previous article, Russia recently opened a notable solar panel plant that lies above the Article Circle, in a Siberian village of Batagai.Wind also has considerable potential, especially along Russia's seashores near Murmansk in the North, and near Vladivostok in the Far East. In the volcanically active Kamchatka, geothermal energy is plentiful as the same conditions exit in Iceland where 93% of it total energy demand comes from geothermal power. And in the middle of Russia, biomass based generation, such as wood pellet plants, can take advantage of the fact that Russia has largest forest reserves in the world.For development of renewable energy, the critical dimension is not so much the north to south range, but rather Russia's vast distances of east to west. In these different areas are also extensive economic and demographic differences across vast Russian territories. As now in many other countries, the path toward green energy development for Russia's renewable energy depends on the combination of local on-site energy systems. In the more densely populated European areas, larger installations connected to the central grid make technological and economic sense. Yet there are vast areas of Russia where on-site power generation from renewable energy makes more sense. For example in Siberia, distributed on-site power is more economic. In the Far East, in places like Oktyabrsky, is a small fishing village in the Far East on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula that we mentioned in our previous article, the logistical and economic hurdles of supplying expensive diesel fuel to remote areas is the driving factor.Russia's Energy Ministry estimates that 20 million people in Russia rely, in whole or in part, on expensive diesel generators. The replacement of these systems to renewable energy power technologies is a natural market for solar and wind energy that alone can generate up to 1 GW of energy. And that would be a billion dollar investment opportunity for shrewd investors."}, {"title": "Smart Zoo Has Its Caging Priorities Right", "text": "Finding a way to share the natural world with the world's most probing, curious animals — human beings — is complicated.

It's nearly three times the length of North America's Yellowstone volcanic track.According to a new study, published online in the journal Nature on Sept. 14, the earliest volcanoes in the chain formed 33 million years ago as the continent of Australia shifted northward over a so-called \"hotspot,\" which is a mantle plume fed by hot rock that slowly made its way to the Earth's surface from about 1,864 miles underground.Surprisingly, the hotspot sits away from tectonic plate boundaries, where most volcanoes are found.\"We are not the first to find these volcanoes. Most of them have been known about for at least 40 years,\" Dr. Rhodri Davies, a researcher at Australian National University's School of Earth Sciences and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in a telephone interview. \"What we provide in this study is a mechanism for explaining why they are where they are ... It's the first study to explain why the volcanoes pop up where they do along this track.\"Researchers analyzed the surface geology and geochemistry of 15 volcanoes in eastern Australia to determine when volcanic activity began in the region, Live Science reported. The researchers then compared that data to previous research outlining how the tectonic plate that makes up the Australian continent has shifted over millions of years.Scientists discovered that the volcanoes weren't formed at the edge of tectonic plates -- the continent-sized slabs of rock on the Earth's surface that shift about to create mountains and earthquake zones, as well as volcanoes.Instead, they found that the \"hotspot\" was responsible for all of the volcanic activity along the chain. When the plume reaches around 80 miles beneath Earth's surface it can melt, which makes the volcanic activity visible on land.\"You can think of it as a lava lamp,\" Davies said. \"The plume rises from the core-mantle boundary, and then you get the volcanoes.\"The researchers noted that their study could help scientists better understand how volcanoes form, and how mantle plumes interact with the Earth's continental crust.\"Ultimately this new understanding may help us to reconstruct the past movements of continents from other hotspots,\" Dr. Nick Rawlinson, professor of geophysics at the University of Aberdeen's School of Geosciences in Scotland and a co-author of the study, said in a written statement.What else is hidden beneath your feet inside Earth?

Their answer was an overwhelming YES! A staggering majority - 73 percent - of voters support the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placing stricter limits on the amount of ozone pollution (also called smog) that power plants, oil refineries and other industrial facilities can release. Those are the results of data released September 9 from a nationwide survey conducted for the American Lung Association.This resounding support for healthier air comes despite a multi-million dollar industry advertising campaign opposing stricter standards. In fact, voter support for stricter smog standards is even stronger now than it was in a November 2014 poll. No matter how often and how loudly healthy air opponents \"cry wolf\" about stricter smog standards, Americans just aren't buying it. They know less smog means better health for all of us.Millions of Americans are breathing polluted air that leads to serious suffering, including asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections, and even premature death. That's why American voters overwhelmingly support continued steps to protect our health from the dangers of smog pollution. Their enthusiasm for stronger ozone pollution standards has grown from 68 to 73 percent since our last poll in November 2014. Support for tougher standards spanned across demographics, party lines, and geographic location.Opponents have spent millions of dollars attacking health-based ozone standards, but our poll shows that the public won't be fooled by the polluters' misleading rhetoric. Support for the new standards remained high, by an overwhelming 2-1 margin, even after voters heard balanced messages from both sides of the issue, including messages from opponents predicting negative consequences in both energy costs and jobs.

The natural wonder's current eruption has been putting on a dramatic show for decades, stunning visitors and scientists alike.Depending on the activity of the volcano at the time of your visit, you could see lava flowing directly into the ocean, sulfuric smoke billowing out of Halemaumau Crater, or the red glow of a lava lake at nightfall.Even if the lava isn't particularly active, a visit to Volcanoes National Park is still worth it. Whether you're hiking across the floor of a solidified lava lake or walking through the interior of an eerily beautiful lava tube, prepare to be amazed.Kauai is a nature-lovers dream. It's geologically the oldest of the main Hawaiian islands and while plenty of hikes will take you deep into its lush terrain, the Na Pali Coast is the undisputed gem in this crown.With 3,000 foot cliffs, picturesque sea caves, colorful valleys and white sandy beaches, the Na Pali Coast is one of the most stunning natural wonders in the world. And, rightfully so, there are several ways to experience its scenic bliss.Adventurers may opt to kayak the 17 mile coast or hike the jagged peaks, but the views from catamaran or helicopter tours are just as stunning. However you decide to experience Na Pali, just make sure you do.As the most populated of the Hawaiian islands, Oahu has plenty of attractions, but if you're going to make time for just one, make sure it's historic Pearl Harbor.The attractions at Pearl Harbor, including the Battleship Missouri Memorial, the Pacific Aviation Museum and the unmistakable Arizona Memorial, are powerful, educational and emotional experiences for all ages.Pro tip: Keep an eye out for the iridescent sheen of oil on the water above the sunken hull of the USS Arizona. Droplets of oil -- which some refer to as \"the tears of the Arizona\" -- still leak from the wreckage.This winding road trip on Maui's north shore will be a drive you'll never forget. The rushing waterfalls, panoramic ocean vistas, and roadside stands offering fresh fruit and famed banana bread make it an all-time favorite for visitors to Maui.The Hana Highway is fewer than 65 miles, but we would recommend setting aside an entire day for the trip. The more time you have to make pit stops and take photos, the better. You'll be glad you factored in extra time when you stumble upon a trail that screams, \"Hike me!\"Lanai is one of Hawaii's best kept secrets. With fewer visitors than the other islands -- and only a handful of hotels -- the sparsely populated island has charm and beauty to spare. With sky-high pine trees, rolling pastures and world-class beaches, Lanai feels like paradise.Immerse yourself in Lanai's uniquely rural landscape by horseback riding through the somewhat rugged terrain. You'll be treated to the wide expanses of countrysides and views of the surrounding ocean. On a clear day, you can expect to see nearby Maui and Kahoolawe.Visiting Kalaupapa is a sobering journey into one of the most fascinating and haunting times in Hawaiian history. The peninsula was once used as an isolated colony for people affected with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. To this day, former patients continue to live at Kalaupapa by choice.The National Historical Park is surrounded by towering cliffs and deep blue ocean, and the only way to get there is by hiking, riding a mule or flying on a small plane.

The treaty's success in phasing out CFCs and related chemicals prevented millions of deaths from skin cancer, millions of cases of cataracts, and well as suppression of the immune systems of humans and animals, and damage to crops and the build environment.It is indeed worth celebrating the stellar accomplishment of this treaty eliminating CFCs and related chemicals, making it the most successful of all the multilateral treaties that are trying to protect the environment. This victory was hard won, over the initial opposition of chemical companies who damned the scientists who first warned the world of the damage CFCs were causing. But Mario Molina and Sherry Rowland stuck to their guns and went on to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their pioneering work.Less well known, at least until recently, is the other achievement of the Montreal Protocol--solving a significant amount of climate change. In fact, the efforts to phase out CFCs from our spray cans, air conditioners, and other products and equipment managed to solve an amount of the climate problem that otherwise would have equaled the warming now being caused by carbon dioxide, the climate pollutant responsible for 55 to 60 percent of all warming since the Industrial Revolution. This is because CFCs and related fluorinated gases are super climate pollutants, responsible for thousands of times more warming on a molecule for molecule basis than carbon dioxide. Professor V. Ramanathan pointed this out back in 1975, following the seminal paper by Molina and Rowland the year before.It's worth remembering that the effort to rid the world of CFCs started first with citizen boycotts, then national measures in the US, Canada, and Europe, followed by the Montreal Protocol. The global warming this combined effort avoided is equal to the contribution from carbon dioxide. In a major story in The Economist magazine last fall, they ranked all actions that had significantly contributed to climate protection. The Montreal Protocol, by their calculation, provided about as much climate protection as all other measures together, including China's one child policy and the economic collapse of the Soviet Union.This is an astounding achievement, and one we need to recognize as we celebrate the success protecting the ozone layer, which is now on the path to recover by 2065.We also need to learn from the Montreal Protocol example, and apply it to more of the climate problem. The best way to do this is to start by expanding climate protection under the Montreal Protocol and use it to phase down the next group of damaging refrigerants, hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs. Led by the Federated States of Micronesia and island allies, 95 countries have submitted formal proposals to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs. Many other countries, including China, Brazil, and India have agreed with President Obama, one of the champions of the HFC amendment, to support the HFC amendment. After several years of discussions, there are only a very few countries still resisting, principally Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, along with Pakistan, although Pakistan may be moving towards the supporting group.There are multiple benefits to agreeing to the HFC amendment when the Montreal Protocol parties meet the first week of November for their annual week-long decision-making meeting. First is the fact that phasing down HFCs will avoid the equivalent of up to 100 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, and prevent up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century. It also will catalyze improvements in the energy efficiency of air conditioners and other appliances using refrigerants, which with a parallel push could avoid the equivalent of another 100 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2050, by saving enough electricity to avoid building up to 2,500 medium-sized power plants.The second benefit from a successful HFC amendment is the re-affirmation of the value of multilateral solutions to global problems. The world should gain great confidence from the multilateral success of solving the first major threat to the global atmosphere, and the major contribution we've made in solving the current threat of climate change.Finally, agreeing to the amendment will provide a significant down payment towards the climate mitigation the world needs to stay below 2°C.

The fund started with $100,000 in seed money from billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and his wife, philanthropist Kat Taylor, and aims to raise an additional $150,000 from crowdfunded donations. (Steyer launched a similar campaign, the Climate Relief Fund, on a national scale last year.)\"From devastating drought to dangerous wildfires, California’s families are already feeling the impacts of climate change,\" Steyer said in a statement about the fund's launch. \"As Californians, we stand ready to lend a hand to our friends and neighbors. The California Drought Relief Fund will provide critical assistance to communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Their struggles remind us of our moral responsibility to protect our communities while we address the cause of the climate crisis and build a better future for our children.\"The group has raised about $25,000, with an uptick in the last week as out-of-control wildfires raged across Northern California.Wildfires aren't unusual during California's typically hot, dry summers. With 92 percent of the state experiencing severe drought, the Golden State is now having what officials have deemed its worst wildfire season ever. According to state data, there have been 5,225 wildfires in 2015 -- 1,583 more than the average over the last five years.Two of the season's largest and most destructive wildfires broke out last week: the Valley Fire, which has burned 67,000 acres in Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties, and the Butte Fire, which has scorched more than 71,000 acres in Amador and Calaveras counties. Those fires are currently 15 percent and 37 percent contained, respectively.Money from the fundraising is already being put to use in communities affected by the Valley and Butte fires.One of the three groups backed by the fund is the California Fire Foundation, a nonprofit that provides aid to firefighters as well as to communities. The foundation purchases gift cards to give to fire crews, who in turn can distribute them to people who have lost their homes or have been displaced.\"It's supplying aid to victims right there on the spot to get them a hot meal, some clothes, something to carry them through a tough night,\" foundation spokesman Carroll Wills said. \"It's a way to offer immediate assistance on the worst day of their lives.\"The foundation also offers aid to the families of fallen firefighters, provides emergency preparation kits for the elderly and helps spread fire safety awareness to Spanish and Vietnamese-speaking communities.The drought relief fund is backing two organizations in California's Central Valley, where taps have run dry in some communities. One of the groups, Self Help Enterprises, installs temporary water tanks and helps individuals connect to municipal water supplies. The other, the Environmental Coalition for Water Justice, provides bottled water in areas where the water is no longer safe to drink.Backed by 350.org, Courage Campaign and other groups hoping to spur action on global warming, the Drought Relief Fund also hopes to raise awareness of climate change and its implications.\"Warmer climate is making everything drier, and has made wildfires worse,\" Climate Relief Fund project director Camron Assadi said.Recent studies have linked the drought to rising temperatures. A report released last month found that global warming has worsened the effects of California's drought by quickening moisture loss in already dry soil and trees. In March, another study found that climate change has created conditions that increased the likelihood of severe drought.View photos from the Valley Fire below:"}, {"title": "A Fight to Protect Loons, One Sign at a Time", "text": "It's Friday and Drew and I are out with the Loon Preservation Committee's (LPC) senior biologist, John Cooley to take rafts and floating signs in for the winter. It will take a couple hours for us to grab signs at Plum Island in Roberts Cove and Winter Harbor near Tuftonboro on Lake Winnipesaukee, but we will get to see how the loons and chicks are doing today.As we head towards Plum Island in the boat, we spot a parent loon and chick. They are near the raft, which has been acting as their nest this season, and we plan to move it ashore. Some loons prefer to nest on rafts as they have obvious boundaries to spot predators and can rise and fall with changing water levels in the lake. Yet, if a loon is attacked, they are tough birds. In Maine, it is reported that a pack of loons attacked an aggressive coyote, causing it to drown.Raft that acted as the chick's nest all season & part of a loon egg shell (Photos copyright Antonia Sohns)We pull the raft onto shore and the mother and baby swim closer to our boat. The chick swims in so close that I see its beautiful gray feathers beneath the water. Its small head ducks under water and then emerges, peering sideways at us. The parent swims closer in order to get in between its chick and the boat. Suddenly, it calls out. After the abrupt song, the parent and chick swim further off and do not return while we do our work hoisting the raft onto the rocks and anchoring it for the winter.Floating signs and rafts help protect loon nesting areas and newly born chicks. Boats see the orange signs and slow down or keep a look out for birds they otherwise did not know were around. LPC has been using these tools and others since 1975 in order to help the loon population rebound from less than 100 pairs of loons that year to over 280 pairs of loons in 2014.Drew and John searching for the buoy's anchor (Photo copyright Antonia Sohns)Loon populations were down due to dramatic human development and lack of awareness of populations' needs. LPC has worked tirelessly with over 1,500 members and volunteers to restore a healthy population of loons to New Hampshire's lakes and promote awareness of loons to the public.While LPC has made great progress protecting loon populations, they remain threatened by continued lakefront development, lead, and climate change. Annually, between six and eight loons are killed by lead sinkers and jigs used in fishing. It is the single greatest factor in adult mortality. Fortunately, a new ban on lead sinkers and hooks that weigh less than one ounce will become effective in New Hampshire on June 1, 2016.John looking at loons in the Broads (Photo copyright Antonia Sohns)As we passed people on shore, they would see the words 'Loon Preservation Committee' emblazoned on the side of the boat and call out to John telling him about the loons they'd seen and ask how the loons are doing. We saw two more loons fishing in the Broads and another parent and chick in Winter Harbor. The chick appeared to be learning how to fly. It would rear up, spread its wings, flap wildly, and then fall sideways. As winter approaches, most loons will migrate to the coast and to the south to winter at sea. Some fly as far as Long Island Sound. Many loons return to the same sea cove each year and come back to the islands on the lake where they were born in the spring.Yet, loons face a challenging future as climate change impacts the environment. In the spring, when they return from their long journey, the lakes may still be frozen due to longer and harsher winters. Or climate change may cause waters to warm significantly and alter the lake's habitat so the waters and its ecosystems no longer support the food loons depend on and they will have to migrate north to find a suitable environment. A recent study by the Audubon Society found that by 2080 the nearest loon may be in Canada.Loons are heralds of a healthy environment. Hopefully with continued protection and hard work we will be lucky enough to hear the call of the loons for years to come."}, {"title": "Flash Flood Kills At Least 16 In Utah", "text": "Flash floods have killed 12 people near Utah's border with Arizona when a \"large wall of water and debris\" triggered by heavy rain pounding nearby canyons swept them away in their cars, officials said on Tuesday.In Zion National Park to the north, four people died and three were missing after going to explore canyons on Monday, officials said.\"Another tragedy for our state.

In its own predictions this year, Pew Charitable Trusts forecast that clean energy technologies led by solar power will attract more than two-thirds of the nearly $8 trillion the world is expected to spend on new electric capacity by 2030.Broadly speaking, two interwoven market forces will drive that investment: the need to end energy poverty around the world, and the equally compelling need to reign in climate change by eliminating greenhouse gas pollution. Clean and renewable energy resources hit both targets.As always, we can expect a lot of heavy international politics to be in play in Paris.

The number of people needing food security approaches 30 percent of Haiti's population.TORONTO - The world's inability to manage climate change is contributing to increased political stability and unrest worldwide, according to Columbia University professor Marc Levy, who conducts research for U.S. government agencies. Speaking at a global security forum, Levy said that record drought in Syria between 2006 and 2010 crippled agriculture there, caused jobless rural residents to move to cities, and resulted in greater dissatisfaction with the government. Levy said that some of the refugees trying to reach Europe from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan are fleeing from climate stressed lands.  CAPE CANAVERAL - World sea levels have gone up an average of nearly 3 inches over the last 13 years because of warmer waters and melting ice, a group of NASA scientists has reported. Sea levels are rising faster than in the past and are likely to rise even faster in the future, they said, including a significant increase on the West Coast of the United States over the next two decades.SHANGHAI - Transportation by air, rail and sea was disrupted in eastern China recently due to one of the most powerful typhoons to strike the area in decades. More than 1 million people were forced to evacuate from two provinces. All commercial flights from the provinces were cancelled and 51,000 ships were forced back to shore as wind speeds reached more than 100 miles an hour.THAILAND - In the grip of its worst drought in more than a decade, Thailand is contending with water shortages to irrigate its rice fields. Water rationing is underway in nearly a third of the country. Fighting has broken out between farmers competing for water from a small canal in a province near Bangkok.OSLO - Scientists have released findings of an upward trend in unprecedented hazards from heat waves and intense downpours due to warmer air. Researchers found there were more record rainstorms from 1981 to 2010 than should have been expected based on records going back to 1900. The year with the most record events was 2010 when tropical storm Hermine lashed Texas and 2,000 people were killed by flooding in Pakistan. Southeast Asia suffered the largest increase in extreme weather, followed by Europe.BANGLADESH - Tens of thousands of people were marooned and at least 23 killed earlier this year by flash floods and landslides caused by heavy rain in southeastern Bangladesh. Officials said that India, Bangladesh and China are at most risk from flooding rivers due to climate change and economic development in low-lying regions.UNITED STATES - In August, 88 large active wildfires fueled by drought conditions were underway in 10 states including Idaho, Washington, California, Montana and Oregon. By mid-September, more than 8.2 million acres were burned by wildfires nationwide, an area larger than the state of Maryland. Fires in California reached \"post apocalyptic\" levels of destruction, displacing thousands of people, destroying hundreds of homes and damaging five large power plants. Weather forecasters predict that fire danger will get even worse this fall in California and the Pacific Northwest.Meantime, at least 9 people were reported dead after intense rainfall caused flash floods on the Arizona-Utah border this week. Earlier this year, Texas and Oklahoma experienced record-breaking floods caused by heavy rain. Firefighters performed more than 500 water rescues in Houston alone. The flooding followed studies that showed precipitation totals increased 10 percent in east Texas over the last century, and parts of Texas can expect extreme precipitation to increase as much as 30 percent by mid-century.Floods, some of them deadly, also occurred in South Dakota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, Maine, and Massachusetts in 2015.That has been the weather so far this year on the road to Paris. It represents only a small sample of what the world will experience unless geopolitics finally give way to geophysical realities this December.Photo: A NASA satellite captured this image of smoke from just one of the fires that burned earlier this year in California, this one near the San Bernardino National Forest."}, {"title": "El Niño Can Do Some Serious Trash Talking", "text": "\"The water is soooo warm!\"That sentence keeps popping out of Angelenos' mouths. It's practically impossible to stick a toe into the California Pacific Ocean without making some sort of immediate involuntary exclamation regarding the water temperature. And the water has been unbelievably warm lately. The surf zone is full of swimmers frolicking in the waves. And even my cold-water averse puppy is now joyously prancing on his skinny little legs through the surf.But along with the in-and-out, back-and-forth of the waves, my own moments of beach-ly delight also have an up-and-down quality. See, every time I stroll across the sand, I notice trash. Some pieces of trash are large items that people have obviously left on purpose, too neglectful to carry them away. Other pieces are small bits of plastic: a torn shred of wrapper, a crumb of rubber band that accidentally got away. I can't help myself from noticing it. And I can't help myself from picking it up, every piece I see, walking it over to a trash can, and throwing it in. When I see a piece of beach trash, nothing in me will allow me to walk past it. I can't not pick it up.A few days ago, as the sun was setting and most of the people had gone, I saw a seagull with a water bottle in its mouth. It reminded me of my puppy, who loves to chew a water bottle. He'll grab it and run gleefully in circles until he drops and gets busy on the cap. If I don't take it off him, he will start to swallow the chewed pieces. The gull was doing the same thing, playing with the bottle near the edge of the water, pecking instead of chewing, but otherwise in the same bouncy mood. I chased him down, took the water bottle off him and recycled it.So I left the beach with mixed feelings. I'm just one person on one beach for one day. What about the rest of the beaches? What about the other days? Who will pick up the plastic there?I come to this blog with similar mixed feelings. The warm waves feel wonderful, but I know it's warm because of El Niño, the global climate event that starts on the eastern side of the Pacific Ocean all the way from California down to Peru. El Niño is complicated.[1] Will it bring much-needed rain to the parched southwestern region of the United States and relieve us from this ongoing drought? Will it be too much rain all at one time? Will it cause flooding and landslides?Even now the warmer waters on our side of the Pacific are causing many species that thrive in cooler waters to struggle while warmer water species are temporarily moving in. Sure, it's interesting to SCUBA dive and see tropical fish, but the sea lions who depend on cooler waters are hating it big time.Up-and-down, back-and-forth, in-and-out.I figured you wouldn't want to read yet another depressing piece about how much we're trashing our planet. So, in searching for something less dismal, I went to talk with Bill Patzert and Josh Willis, unarguably the world's leading experts on El Niño, to see what they had to say about our current El Niño conditions (other than the fact that they're making a swim more pleasant and bringing lots of pink clouds to our Southern California sunsets).As I walked in, the two NASA oceanographers were in the middle of a discussion about the impact of El Niño rains on the amount of ocean trash. \"Oh perfect,\" I thought. \"So I'm going with a trash-themed blog. Game on, Oscar the Grouch, game on.\"When I told them about my inability to walk past trash at the beach, Patzert said, \"Our beaches have been exceptionally clean for over a decade now because we haven't had a strong El Niño. As soon as those rains come, any trash hibernating in our storm sewers or on our streets will get flushed into the L.A. River and onto SoCal beaches.\"Woohoo, trash!! Too bad Oscar isn't a sea monster. He'd be elated.Find out more about El Niño and the NASA instruments that study the phenomenon from space here.Thank you for your comments.Laura[1] Some scientific info about El Niño: Most of the time, under normal ocean conditions, trade winds blow from the east side of the Pacific to the west side. These winds push surface water towards the Western Pacific near Asia and Australia where the warm water piles up. This Western Pacific Warm Pool contains some of the warmest ocean waters on the planet. Every decade or so, the trade winds soften and all that warm water that normally stays on the western side of the Pacific, sloshes back towards the east and we get a phenomenon known as El Niño. Since the Pacific Ocean takes up about half of planet Earth, it has the potential to affect global weather patterns. A strong El Niño can bring warm moist conditions to the West Coasts of the Americas, while leaving Australia and Southeast Asia unusually dry. So far, the 2015-2016 El Niño is shaping up to be an exceptionally strong one.This post originally appeared on NASA's Earth Right Now blog."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - September 15, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: California's all-time record heat and record drought explode into more record wildfire, as the state succeeds in passing some -- but not all -- of its ambitious clean energy agenda; PLUS: Score one for the bees: Appeals court overturns EPA approval of bee-killing pesticide...

I had been out of town for a while and I really needed to see her.She's always been there for me: strong, peaceful, and beautiful, with a quiet wisdom. I would go to see her and tell her my troubles, share my sorrows. Somehow she was always able to take them away, silently, just by being there to listen. Even on days when I just felt the need to step away from the noise of daily life, I would go to her and sit with her and somehow that time together fed my soul in a very special and unique way, the way only good friends and loved ones can.That's why when I went to see her yesterday my heart broke when I found she was gone. Someone somehow had taken her from me, from all of us. Leaving only a small remnant of where she once stood.She gave the same quiet space and shared her branch -- where I would often sit and think -- freely, cradling me with the strength and gentleness of mother. That's why in that moment when I saw she was gone, it felt much like an unexpected, sudden death of a healthy friend or loved one taken from us too soon.My friend, \"my\" tree, stood on a quiet, somewhat secluded path in the Presidio where I am fortunate to live. Obviously she never belonged to me alone, she belonged to everyone and anyone who chose to acknowledge her. I suppose that technically she belonged to the Presidio Trust, the same people who chose to cut her down.I asked myself (and them) why this choice was made. Why were she and so many other trees being cut down in this urban forest? These weren't sick trees, they weren't obstructing a path. They weren't doing anything but cleaning our air and providing solace and regeneration for the souls who chose to appreciate them.Trees are alive and when trees breathe they take in carbon dioxide, release oxygen and store carbon in their trunks. Trees lock away carbon in a more permanent way than other plant species due to their size and relatively longer life spans. So when I learned that many trees were being cut down to restore parts of the park to what it was long ago with smaller plants replacing trees, I was not satisfied. Cutting down trees alters carbon storage, releasing carbon dioxide into the air as the wood decays worsening climate change--something we simply cannot afford to do. As I stared at the woodchips and dust that were once towering icons of nature and the now barren landscape, I wept for their loss and for ours.Full disclosure, I work for an environmental group. Still, neither I nor others would say I'm a traditional \"tree-hugger\" environmentalist. I drive (probably too much considering I live in the city). I use paper towels. Yes, I use paper towels...sounds silly but that's the one that really got me today filling me with guilt for the many trees who lost their lives for my \"convenience\" and that got me thinking about connections. Of course I know that paper comes from trees, yet even I, who am exposed to environmental messages daily, hadn't kept the connection present enough to motivate me to make a lasting change.Here in California we are all extremely worried about the drought. We are seeing the impacts all around us and we are taking action. Yet for years we have acted recklessly, wasting water unnecessarily never stopping to think that it would run out, never mind the fact that we are putting the homes of other animals and plants at risk and, as a result, putting ourselves at risk as well. We've burned forests, coal and oil, depleting our planet, polluting our air, lakes, lungs and rivers and still get caught up in partisan debates over whether or not we should have strong rules in place to fight climate change and limit pollution as if somehow, people who align themselves with one party would somehow be immune to the effects of pollution.No death should be in vain and the loss of my friend the tree, and the realization that I will never sit on her branch again, I feel a heightened awareness of the importance of remembering our connectedness and the consequences of our actions. It's easy to not care about the ocean if we haven't splashed around in the water or watched the sunset on its horizon. It's easy to leave all the lights on when we don't see the pollution that fossil fuels dump into our air.There are of course much greater tragedies in our world than the loss of this tree. However, if we fail to see our connectedness to each other and to nature, and how our actions impact us all, we will never make the change we need to keep our planet and ourselves healthy and thriving.I will keep seeking answers about the loss of the trees in our forest. I am by far not an expert but I am an activist and want to understand the reasons why and let those making the decisions know that I and many others care. It's the least I can do for my friend."}, {"title": "Interior Secretary Defends Fossil Fuels: 'You Can't Just Cut It Off Overnight'", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on Tuesday defended fossil fuel development on public lands, as the Obama administration faces increasing pushback from its environmental base.\"We are a nation that continues to be dependent on fossil fuels,\" Jewell told reporters at an event Tuesday morning. \"The president in his Climate Action Plan has said clearly that we need to move to a lower-carbon future. I am very proud to work for a president that has been as direct and forceful in his messaging as President Barack Obama.\"Environmental groups have criticized the administration for advocating for action on climate change while also approving oil drilling in the Arctic and opening new areas off the East Coast for exploration.Jewell said that her department, along with other parts of the federal government, has been working to reduce the United States' contribution of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.\"But,\" she continued, \"right now, we are sitting under lights that are likely powered by coal. Most of you probably burned some fossil fuels in one way or another to get here. There are millions of jobs around this country that are dependent on these industries. You can't just cut it off overnight and expect to have an economy that is, in fact, a leader in the world.\"Shortly after Jewell's remarks, a coalition of environmental groups held a small rally in front of the White House calling for an end to all fossil fuel development on public lands, including coal mining and oil and gas extraction. Groups involved in the rally included Physicians for Social Responsibility, Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network and 350.org, which have joined with others to form the \"Keep It in the Ground\" campaign.The campaign is “based on the notion that we are in a climate crisis,” said Friends of the Earth President Erich Pica.“Scientists have said that we need to keep 80 percent of all the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground” in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, he added.But in her remarks Tuesday morning, Jewell indicated that ending development on public lands is a position the Obama administration wouldn't be adopting anytime soon.\"I think it oversimplifies a very complex situation to suggest that one could simply cut off leasing or drilling on public lands and solve the issue of climate change,\" she said. \"We all have a responsibly to act and there are things we are doing and will continue to do to reduce the carbon footprint and put incentives in place for all of us to do a better job in how we use carbon.\"Philip Lewis and Ruby Mellen contributed reporting."}, {"title": "What Megablazes Tell Us About The Fiery Future Of Climate Change", "text": "Pervasive drought and record temperatures have turned forests from Fresno to Fairbanks into tinderboxes. And it's only getting worse"}, {"title": "Worlds Apart", "text": "Two oceans and 8,000 miles separate India from the United States--but the cultural chasm between the countries is even bigger, especially when it comes to the welfare of stray animals. Some people may find it surprising, but Delhi (India's second most populous city) does better by its strays than does the vast majority of America. Unfortunately, that may be changing. And the consequences for stray pets in India are dire. More on that later; first, a few details.In the United States, most homeless dogs, cats, and other pets are brought to taxpayer-funded \"shelters.\" After a few days, if they are not claimed by an owner, they are put down (a sterile euphemism for \"killed\"). Best Friends Animal Society estimates that 4 million unwanted or lost animals are disposed of every year in this manner by U.S. shelters and \"humane societies.\"   But a very different - and far better - model is being practiced in Delhi, India, one that pragmatically addresses the realities of stray overpopulation and human health while keeping its moral compass set firmly on animal welfare and compassionate care. It's proven remarkably efficient, extremely popular, and very effective in the portions of India it services. And yet, it is in danger of collapse.The Delhi-based non-governmental organization (NGO) called Friendicoes has been innovating in this space for decades. What the group has accomplished in its 35-year history is astounding: starting in 1979 in a single, tiny room with a dozen or so stray dogs and cats, Friendicoes has since grown to include a sanctuary for thousands of sick, aged, or unwanted animals, including dogs, cats, horses, monkeys, and even cows (among others). They also run a mobile clinic for unhealthy or overworked equines (mostly horses and donkeys).And a cornerstone Friendicoes service has been the Animal Birth Control (ABC) program, which, rather than killing strays, sterilizes and vaccinates them against rabies instead. Though the human population of Delhi has grown astronomically of late (the territory's population is now almost three times that of New York City), the homeless pet rate has actually decreased in that time, and, according to officials at Friendicoes, there has not been a single case of rabies in years there. Another plus: Because the number of strays is now under control, the number of human-animal conflicts has dropped drastically, leaving the great majority of citizens in support of the program. To say that Friendicoes has been successful would be a serious understatement.But the times, they are a-changing.Recently, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation reneged on payment for nearly a year's worth of ABC work that had already been performed, leaving the group in such a financial lurch that they've had to cease their 24-hour ambulance service for injured animals. This has been an essential component of their overall program, and every day that an ambulance sits idle, countless injured animals suffer on the street or in ditches. And that's not all: Friendicoes may be forced to shutter its entire operation if the economic issues aren't soon resolved.   These programs are very popular; obviously the citizens of Delhi get it. And obviously the city government needs to get it. After all, it's been their good fortune that an NGO like Friendicoes has managed animal control for them in the massive Delhi community all these years. If the government continues to renege on its obligations and Friendicoes is forced to shut down, one of two grim scenarios is certain to unfold: 1) The number of street animals will drastically increase, leading to a multitude of new conflicts with people and a possible resurgence of rabies, or 2) the city will end up spending a fortune doing animal control itself for an urban environment of more than 16 million people.This is absurd when you consider that the money owed Friendicoes is equivalent to less than $100,000. Most importantly, either scenario will increase the suffering of Delhi's stray pet population dramatically. In places like Mumbai and Kovalam, misguided citizens have resorted to the outright killing of stray pets on the street - sometimes with poison, sometimes with hand tools, sometimes with fire. It is even conceivable that the city could return to the days of mass euthanasia. This has already been proposed by the government in the Indian state of Kerala. Either way, it amounts to catastrophe for the animals.It is senseless that Friendicoes, which should be a model program for the developed world - the U.S., in particular - is in danger of collapse after decades of proving itself effective, economical, and humane. If an organization like Friendicoes is forced to shutter under these circumstances, what does that say for our hopes for applying its wisdom and compassion to our country where 4 million homeless animals are disposed of annually?  Please get involved by signing the petition today.More information on Friendicoes is available at their website."}, {"title": "Cats Shoot Down Zombies Like You Know They Should", "text": "It's good to know cats could have our backs during a zombie apocalypse.In this fun video from Mr.TVCow, a crack team of feline fighters bravely attempts to save a kitten from the undead.To get the job done, these pets aren't afraid to use some heavy firepower.Lock and load, my sweeties.H/T Laughing SquidAlso on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."}, {"title": "What Megablazes Tell Us About The Fiery Future Of Climate Change", "text": "Pervasive drought and record temperatures have turned forests from Fresno to Fairbanks into tinderboxes.

The U.S. also exports crude oil to Canada, and recently announced a landmark decision to allow crude oil export swaps with Mexico."}, {"title": "World's Biggest Carbon Emitters Convene in LA to Ramp Up Efforts Around Climate Change", "text": "United States and China to Meet for Smart Cities Summit  News broke in November of last year that the world's largest developing nation and the world's most developed nation would ramp up efforts to work together in fighting climate change. President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping made a historic joint announcement on climate change in 2014, establishing ambitious climate pledges and committing to work together, and with other countries, to achieve a global climate agreement in Paris this December.  At the upcoming U.S.-China Climate-Smart/Low-Carbon Cities Summit in Los Angeles, both nations are expected to announce actions to combat ongoing climate change. A leader in energy efficiency, Los Angeles is an ideal city to host the summit, the first major event held since the 2014 presidential agreement between the two countries. This convening could not be timelier for the City of Los Angeles as Mayor Eric Garcetti released the city's first-ever sustainability plan in April of this year, titled Sustainable City pLAn.   The Sustainable City pLAn focuses on the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental and social; and sets the bold goal of reducing city emissions by 80 percent by 2050, with a short term target of a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2017, both compared to 1990 levels. Buildings are heavily targeted under the mayor's plan as they are the largest consumers of electricity in the city, and are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions Los Angeles has already established a successful approach with its Green Building Program.   The Green Building Program requires larger structures to be certified under the 15 year-old LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System and mandates that all new municipal construction or major renovations to municipally owned buildings must achieve, at minimum, LEED Silver certification. To date, the city has certified more than 50 of their buildings, making up more than 2 million square feet of building space, under LEED. With the new plan, the city aims for a 30 percent reduction in energy use across all building types by 2035 - backed up by an array of additional policy measures and actions to drive improvement in all building types, including private sector.  With programs like the China Green Building Label, LEED and WELL Building Standard, China is continuing to scale its leadership by adopting and embracing green building practices that will reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions from buildings while creating healthier indoor spaces for occupants.  For example, the government-supported Hongqiao Central Business District -- a roughly 1.8 square mile area in Shanghai adjacent to the Hongqiao International Airport and high-speed railway station -- is being developed into a low-carbon city anchored by green and healthy buildings. Hongqiao CBD will be a vital vehicle for developing Shanghai as a comprehensive, international transportation hub serving the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region.  Additionally, the Fortune 500 company Shougang Group -- one of China's largest steel companies - has demonstrated tremendous leadership in this space. Under China's 12th five-year plan their main factory, a heritage project in Beijing, is being renamed and transformed into a green ecological demonstration area. The \"New Shougang Advanced Business Zone\" will be a worldwide transformation model of a classic industrial park.  As city leaders from China and the U.S. come together in Los Angeles this month to share actions toward a sustainable future, they should pay close attention to their buildings. Leading cities are demanding high-performing buildings - to help the bottom line, improve air quality, improve human health and wellness, and provide co-benefits, while reducing buildings' contribution to climate change. One need look no further than the summit's host city for inspiration and results. The green building community is committed to climate action, and we look forward to supporting cities in both countries as they craft their next steps to impact climate change. USGBC will be attending this important meeting and remains ready and willing to aid in the evolution of a cleaner, greener future for all. Together, cities will lead the way and make national impact possible."}, {"title": "Interior Department Is Preparing For Possible Government Shutdown", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Interior is already working on its shutdown plans in case Congress isn't able to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government after Sept. 30.\"We profoundly hope there is no government shutdown.

Unfortunately, we're getting pretty good at that.\"Jewell, who took office in 2013, several months before the last government shutdown, expressed frustration that Washington might end up with another one so soon.\"It is very, very frustrating as a business person, now two years into this job,\" said Jewell, who was appointed to Interior from a position as head of the outdoor retailer REI. \"I can't tell you how ridiculous it is to try to run an organization of 70,000 people who are very, very committed to their mission, which is of great importance to the American people, to have to work with them on shutdown planning right now because Congress has not acted on the budget.\"During the 16-day shutdown two years ago, the Interior Department was one of the closed wings of the federal government that drew the most public attention, because it oversees the National Park Service. The closure of the parks drew a lot of public outrage, ruining family vacations and weddings at sites across the country. It was also costly for the government; the Interior Department estimated that the closure caused $414 million in lost revenue in and around the parks.But Jewell said the \"hidden catastrophes\" of a shutdown are even worse, like government scientists who can't use data they've been collecting for an entire year because there is a three-week gap.\"There are many things that aren't as visible as the national parks that are impacted by a shutdown,\" said Jewell. \"It is very, very important that Congress not go down that path again.\""}, {"title": "On Hatteras, Putting Ourselves, and the World, Back Together", "text": "Like summer, turtle hatching season is coming to a close on Hatteras Island, and all along the coast, sunbathers incubate themselves in late summer heat, under strategically planted umbrellas that skirt dozens of fenced nesting areas. Only feet away, just under the surface, the eggs of five turtle species slowly mature, a process that has endured since the dinosaurs.That cycle almost came to a crashing halt. In humanity's short reign, overfishing drove sea turtles almost to extinction -- Churchill's favorite meal was sea turtle soup -- and today ocean gyres of plastic kill still more. These protected nesting sites are an attempt to bring them back.Bobbing in the waves, my daughter Willa wondered why. \"What does it matter if a turtle goes extinct?\" I defaulted to the old saws: the value to humans, medicine, ecology. I told her we're using the psychedelic blue blood of an even older animal, horseshoe crabs, in medicine. Who knows how we might use turtles? I mentioned the risk to the food chain, the role of \"indicator species\" that act as barometers for broader ecosystem health. But those arguments seemed weak, embarrassingly self-serving, and reeked of rationalization. In the end, for all our flaws as humans, I told her, we just can't bear to see these animals go away after thriving for 100 million years. That instinct, I say, has got to be the most remarkable thing about us: It is a miracle that we care.But we do. News about turtle activity spread like a storm surge across the beaches of North Carolina, an underground network, a black market in turtle intel. Near our s'mores fire one night, my wife learned of an unannounced excavation the next day. When we arrived at what we thought was a secret event, we found forty others.A ponytailed National Park Service biologist with his fly charmingly undone sweated through his uniform describing turtle biology -- they swim out to sea to catch the gulf stream (\"Just like in Finding Nemo!\" a kid yells). The males never return, the females come back 30 years later to lay their eggs. We learned that a nearby nest was likely to \"boil\" in the next few days. That night, we visited the site, Willa and me, my wife and daughter. There too, we found throngs.Turtle mania had hit the beaches! Info on excavations spread not through Twitter or Instagram, but though the oldest form of human contact -- schmoozing -- and it went viral like the latest sex tape or reality show. (Though, I admit, this too is a reality show and a sex tape, of sorts.) One Ohio couple spent six nights up until midnight waiting for the eggs to hatch.The biologist explained that other causes of turtle mortality are massive beach rebuilding projects that pump sand off the continental shelf. These efforts to at least forestall the impact of another human screwed-up -- the climate -- also kills turtles, even while it restores some of the nesting sites eroded by sea level rise and superstorms. We can't win for losing, it seems.Perhaps turtle mania is a sign we've had enough. Despite our society's obsession with the inane and vapid, when offered something utterly and beautifully important, something that fulfills the ancient Hebrew notion of Tikkun Olam, the obligation to repair God's creation, we can't resist. Donald Trump and the Kardashians are interesting, I guess, but loggerheads and leatherbacks have soul. On the night of the boil, our son Elias refused to go to bed, insisting we stay late, his own instincts as inexplicable and deeply rooted as the internal compass that pulls hatchlings into the sea.From 8:30 to 10, a group of about 15 milled around, fighting the occasional mosquito and, for the Ohioans at least, the sense that their vacation would end with nothing to show for their waiting. And then the ground broke. A silver dollar-sized hatchling groveled out of the earth in the dull red of an infrared light. And then another, and then 88 more. Guided by the moonlight and the helpful flashlight of a volunteer, they crawled slowly into the ocean to face the longest of possible odds -- only one in 1000 will survive.Their odds are low, but they couldn't be much lower than the chance that we'd care about them at all. And they are higher than the likelihood we'd put down our devices, and for a waning summer moment, focus on our species' earnest, halting, and late efforts to put one part of the world back together."}, {"title": "Scary Video Shows What It's Like To Drive Through A Burning Town", "text": "Northern California erupted in wildfires over the weekend, and much of it -- what NBC's Lester Holt described as twice the size of San Francisco -- remains largely out of control.The Valley fire, notable for how fast it grew in Lake County, north of Napa, burned through 67,000 acres and more than 580 homes, forcing 13,000 people to evacuate as of Tuesday morning, according to the Los Angeles Times.Middletown, where the video below was shot, was especially hit -- 11,000 firefighters fought it as it moved through town at 15 to 20 miles per hour and described it as apocalyptic, something they'd never seen before.Caused by the drought, winds, and bark beetles (which quickly dry out trees), the fires have resulted in one death, and firefighters are combing through the ashes for signs of survivors or other possible deaths.

An invitation to stand up for science against the greatest threat civilization has ever known. An invitation to do more about climate change together than any of us can achieve alone. So circle October 2 on your calendar, and then I'll explain.Ploy AchakulwisutI started doing renewable energy research when I was in high school; I've always believed in the power of science to make the world a better place. But three years ago, halfway through my PhD here at MIT, I started to wonder if I was making any difference at all.While working in the lab each day, trying to build better solar cells and brighter LEDs, I slowly came to a startling realization: when it comes to climate change, the singular crisis of our time, MIT as an institution has no plan. No strategy for how our energy technologies will ever make it out of the lab and into a world where fossil fuels are propped up by trillions of dollars in subsidies every year. No vision for how to implement the carbon pricing mechanisms our economists propose, with a Congress that doesn't even believe global warming is caused by humans. And, unlike every other major university, no goal whatsoever for reducing our own campus carbon footprint. Worse still, I learned that while MIT is fighting climate change with one hand, it is actually feeding it with the other - investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the fossil fuel industry. Don't get me wrong: the pioneering innovation around campus is both vital and astounding. It's what I live for. But solving big problems means thinking about the big picture. It's uncomfortable to say, but MIT simply isn't.It turned out that I wasn't alone in my realizations. From freshman to faculty, physicists to policy wonks, nano-engineers to urban planners (your typical MIT bunch) -- each of us was asking ourselves, \"What are we doing? What is MIT doing?\"But we were also coming to realize MIT's limitless potential. As individuals, most of us are powerless to tackle the lack of societal and political will that underpin climate inaction. But through our Institute, we have a megaphone to public and political opinion and an immense capacity to effect change. MIT could be our most powerful tool, if only we could unlock it.We had no choice. As scientists and engineers, advocacy and politics definitely don't come easily to us, but as Albert Einstein once put it, \"Those who have the privilege to know, have the duty to act.\" So our improbable group of nerds-turned-activists did just that, calling on MIT's President Reif to make climate action the generational mission of our Institute. We researched and outreached. Postered and tabled. Listened and negotiated. Trialed and errored. And in May 2014, President Reif responded, launching the MIT Climate Change Conversation: a year-long campus-wide discussion about the actions the Institute could take against climate change. The mountain was beginning to move.And in the process, we met you. Not just students, staff, and faculty, but countless alumni and local community members anxious to help institutions like MIT realize their potential to confront this crisis. Yes, each of us has different ideas about the best technologies and policies. And yes, we're each passionate about working on different things. But we're all in this together. We're all looking west: at the armies of firefighters risking their lives in a war against endless wildfire. We're all looking east: at the unfathomable millions of Syrian refugees -- the victims of a conflict compounded by years without rain. And we're all looking to the future, wary that unlike politicians, physics does not negotiate. Wary that the climate clock is ticking. Wary that, as President Reif's own Climate Change Conversation committee (on which I sat) concluded, \"Perils ahead dwarf risks to the Institute in navigating this politically charged issue, such that even exceptional measures should not be eschewed.\"Cambridge City Council went as far as to pass an official resolution cheering on MIT climate leadership. And today, 33 of the world's most prominent climate scientists and advocates -- including former NASA climate chief James Hansen, actor Mark Ruffalo, MIT Professor Noam Chomsky, and Rockefeller Brothers Fund President Stephen Heintz -- penned an open letter urging \"the world's foremost citadel of science\" to drop fossil fuel company stocks from its $12.4 billion endowment \"as part of a comprehensive climate action plan.\"That brings us to this fall. Finally, after years of negotiations, President Reif is committed to deciding this semester how (or if) our Institute will take action. The whole of MIT's history is hung on a timeline of \"moments of decision\" like this. Yet the climate question is far from a done deal.Change can be hard and slow for any institution. And with the likes of climate science disinformation bankroller David Koch on MIT's Board, and with our university more dependent on corporate funding than almost any other in the country, anything is possible. Or not. Will MIT take tokenistic steps (a new climate class here, a few solar cells there)? Or will MIT take leadership commensurate with the urgency, magnitude, and nature of this problem? We don't know, and we're not going to sit around to be told our fate. As we begin the Climate Countdown to MIT's next great moment of decision, we want President Reif to know that we've got his back. That all of us -- students, staff, faculty, alumni, interested citizens -- are united behind bold, multi-faceted climate action. We won't accept anything less because our science and our futures are on the line.So here's the plan. Starting September 27, MIT Climate Countdown will begin. A week-long series of events showcasing how each of us is taking climate action -- a chance to collaborate, organize, and mobilize. Then, come noon on October 2, the day of the MIT Corporation's Annual Board Meeting, we'll put business-as-usual on hold. We'll postpone our meetings, leave the library, and step out of lab. And as MIT's leaders convene, we will (with your help) gather on campus in our hundreds to urge them to find the moral courage to do what science demands and what President Reif's own committee has advised. For two hours on October 2, we won't be doing science -- we'll be standing up for it. See you there.Sign up to take action at MITClimateCountdown.org."}, {"title": "Tourists Hide Their Faces In Shame For What They're About To Do", "text": "Nearly 100 animals were recently killed on a property in South Africa, shot dead in an activity so unseemly that even those who paid top dollar to participate in it couldn't bear to show their faces."}, {"title": "President Obama's Mortal Sin", "text": "President Obama's approval of Shell's Arctic oil drilling has tarnished his environmental legacy.INTRODUCTION President Obama is the first incumbent US President to cross the Arctic Circle. The purpose of his expedition was to \"witness first-hand the impact of climate change on the region\" and to announce new measures to address it. Speaking at the Glacier climate summit in Anchorage, Obama recognised the role of the U.S. \"in creating this problem.\" He also stated \"we embrace our responsibility to help solve it\" because failure to do so will \"condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.\" Yet less than one month ago his administration gave the green light to Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic.President Obama must know that it is impossible to protect the Arctic while allowing Shell to drill for oil 70 miles off the coast of Alaska. He cannot have it both ways. His policies and proclamations are irreconcilable.During his three-day excursion to the Arctic Circle he climbed a receding glacier, saw the melting Alaskan permafrost, met vulnerable coastal communities and addressed the Glacier climate summit.On the first day of his trip Obama participated in a roundtable discussion with Alaskan Natives. At the Glacier summit he urged fellow world leaders to reach an agreement at the UNFCCC Paris climate summit, COP21 in December that \"protects the one planet ... while we still can\".On day two Obama hiked the Exit Glacier in the Kenai Fjords National Park. He knows the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the US and he is aware that the Exit Glacier has receded more than a mile since the start of the industrial revolution, with the rate of melting accelerating in the last few decades. He called the glacier \"as good of a signpost as any when it comes to the impacts of climate change\" and said he wanted his grandchildren to be able to see it one day. If President Obama really means this, how can he justify his approval of Shell's plan to drill for oil in the Arctic?On the third day of his trip Obama met with local fishermen and families and attended a cultural performance by the children of Dillingham Middle School. The President joined the children in their last dance, saying: \"I've been practising.\" He visited Kotzebue's sea wall to see the effects of rising sea levels and the devastating impact of increased storm severity. President Obama must know that even if the world agrees to keep temperature rises to 2 degree Celsius, sea levels, due to the melting of the ice, may still rise by 20 feet (6 metres) by 2100.THE ARCTIC In his weekly address on 29th August Obama tried to defend his approval of Shell's Arctic drilling. He said that Americans \"are concerned about oil companies drilling in environmentally sensitive waters\" and he had the audacity to say \"that's precisely why my administration has worked to make sure that our oil exploration conducted under these leases is done at the highest standards possible, with requirements specifically tailored to the risks of drilling off Alaska.\"President Obama must know that no safeguards or standards will be enough to prevent an oil spill. According to a February 2015 report by his Department of the Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (Alaska OCS Region) drilling in the Arctic has a 75% chance of a spill of more than 1,000 barrels of oil.How can President Obama trust Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic when during their last attempt in 2012 their Kulluk rig ran aground off the coast of Alaska, due to what the US Coast Guard called Shell's \"inadequate assessment and management of risks\". Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous and high-risk enterprise. Shell do not have an adequate extraction and spill response infrastructure. When they first attempted to drill in 2012, their response plan prepared for a worst-case oil spill of 25,000 barrels released per day for 30 days. In the same report Shell also made the ludicrous promise to recover 95% of a spill before oil reaches the shoreline despite the industry having recovery percentages of around only 10%, a figure which includes spills in more favourable clean up conditions than the Arctic. A freedom of information request revealed that both of Shell's drilling rigs currently in the Arctic had operational failings. Basic fire drills and abandon ship drills were \"botched\", indicating the crew and equipment were not prepared. The decision to drill for oil in the Arctic is reckless and irresponsible even for Shell's shareholders. The company is only indemnified for $1.15bn per incident, which means that a spill could be followed by a huge asset sale to cover financial liabilities, similar to the one BP had in 2010. A senior official at a Canadian firm that specialises in oil-spill response admitted that \"there is really no solution or method today that we're aware of that can actually recover [spilled] oil from the Arctic.\"To approve Shell's Arctic gamble President Obama should have assessed the oil industry's record. He must be aware that the oil industry has proved unable to operate safely in the Arctic and that any spill could devastate the lives of the four million people who live there and the hundreds of unique species of fish, birds and mammals. According to the Center for Biodiversity all life is under threat in the Arctic, from plankton to great whales, including: reindeer, the Arctic fox, the Pacific Walrus, the gray, beluga and bowhead whales, the spectacled eider and ivory gulls.Cleaning up after oil spills is always a difficult and traumatic task. The Arctic Ocean presents additional problems. The Ocean is covered by ice for eight to nine months of the year, with almost complete darkness for nearly three of those months. Booms and dispersants are less effective because petroleum sticks to ice and the cold temperatures mean there are no microbes present to break down leaked oil. According to WWF there is no ability to respond to a spill for 7-8 months a year and only a 44-46% ability to respond in favourable conditions. Additional spill support may come from the Coast Guard, but the nearest base is 950 miles away. According to Alexander Horne, Professor Emeritus of Ecological Engineering at Berkeley, an oil spill in the Arctic could have more long-term effects than BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster where 11 people died, 17 were injured, 16,000 miles of coastline were affected, and more than 210 million gallons of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days. Despite these overwhelming arguments, Ann Pickard head of Shell Arctic made the preposterous claim to be able to have a response in place, including a containment dome, capping stack, and surface booms, within 60 minutes of an accident.The President must know that Shell's Arctic oil drilling will cause increased greenhouse gas emissions and catastrophic climate change. As people throughout the world are pleading \"the melting Arctic is a dire warning, not an invitation.\"Al Gore described Shell's plan to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea as \"insane\" and called for a ban on all oil and gas activity in the Arctic. NGOs and environmental groups were quick to highlight Obama's paradoxical environmental message, with Rebecca Noblin, Alaska Director for the Center for Biological Diversity saying: \"It's perplexing and depressing to hear President Obama say he wants to fix climate change but then approve Arctic drilling. It's like a doctor diagnosing a patient but then refusing to write a prescription\". Even Hilary Clinton, President Obama's hopeful successor stated, \"The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling.\" Ahead of COP21 this sends a terrible signal to the world, that window dressing is all we can expect from the US President at this critical Climate Summit.The Arctic is often referred to as the 'canary in the coalmine' for climate change. It is our early-warning system. The canary is in bad shape. Arctic ice is melting at a record rate. This year's seasonal minimum is set to be the third or fourth lowest on record, with the four lowest ice coverages occurring since 2007. As the ice retreats there are fewer reflective surfaces to reflect sunlight and the tundra and water that remain when the ice has melted absorbs more heat, causing further warming and making more ice disappear. In a few years, the children of Dillingham Middle School, who the President danced with on his recent visit, will not recognise their home.Warmer temperatures are causing the permafrost to melt, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These permanently frozen lands make up as much as 24% of the northern hemisphere land mass and their emission could double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. According to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report methane is far more potent that carbon dioxide, 21 times more potent on a 100-year scale, and 72 times on a 20-year scale.Melting of the Arctic sea ice is a global threat that could disrupt major ocean circulation patterns and affect the world's climate. This would have severe consequences throughout the world affecting food production, causing price increases and food shortages.Oceans and currents that move waters around the world help regulate the Earth's temperature. El Niño and La Niña weather systems that bring hotter or cooler weather are part of the larger Pacific decadal oscillation system that delivers periods of warmer weather or cooler weather, over decades. This system is currently in a cooling phase, which is \"dampening\" the rise of global average surface temperature. According to a study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) this respite is only temporary. After the hiatus will follow a period of accelerated global warming unless urgent action is taken to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions.Rising sea levels will endanger between 147 and 216 million people, particularly those in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives as well as people in Tokyo, Shanghai, New York and London. According to UNEP a melting Arctic will result in \"more intense and longer periods of rainfall and drought, summer heat waves and cold snaps in winter\".Americans have already experienced the impacts of climate change. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina, one of the most deadly and damaging hurricanes to hit the country, flooded 80% of New Orleans, causing the deaths of 1,833 people and forcing 273,000 people to seek disaster relief. In 2011 and 2012 the Midwest experienced the worst droughts for 50 years, and in 2014 New York was plunged into chaos by record breaking rains and snowstorms.According to the IPCC climate change will increase droughts and floods to the USA, declining water quality, and increased animal and plant mortality. Risk of wildfires has already increased. 2011 and 2012 saw near-record numbers of fires. In 2012 an area the size of the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined was set ablaze. The Whitehouse has reported that climate and weather disasters cost the country more than $100bn in 2012 alone. Air pollution, extreme weather events, and diseases carried by food, water, and insects all bring health risks. There is far more to come. Florida will see further rises in sea level. California will experience further droughts.The President is right to say, \"This is not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.\" Obama has now seen the impacts of climate change during his visit to the Arctic. He must know that to prevent catastrophic climate change 88% of the world's known coal reserves, 52% of gas and 35% of oil must be left untouched. Now is the time for him to choose his side and rescind Shell's permit to drill for oil in the Arctic.According to the Earth League, which includes Lord Nicholas Stern, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber advisor to Angela Merkel and Pope Francis, and US economist Jeffrey Sachs, three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground if average global warming is not to breach a rise of 2 degrees Celsius. In their statement, released on 22nd April 2015 to coincide with Earth Day, they warn that failure to leave oil in the soil and coal in the ground would bring a 1 in 10 risk of going beyond 6°C by 2100, a \"high risk of disaster\" that would be \"equivalent of tolerating about 10,000 airplane crashes every day worldwide.\"When he was elected President Obama promised to deliver a \"new era of responsibility\" and to \"roll back the spectre of a warming planet\". Millions of people around the world including me believed in him and his vision.At the UNFCCC climate summit in Copenhagen, COP15, President Obama proved to be a galvanising force. Attended by 120 Heads of State, COP15 was the largest gathering of its kind, apart from the annual UN General Assembly in New York. The conference was the focus of unprecedented public and media attention but the President's leadership failed and the Copenhagen Accord that resulted was a shameful compromise. Obama missed that opportunity to set the world on the right path to avoiding catastrophic climate change. At this point he was a President in his first year in office, very aware that Congress could override his pledges. Now he only has months left.When COP21 takes place in Paris at the end of 2015, six years will have passed since Copenhagen. COP21 is Obama's last chance to define his environmental legacy.OBAMA'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY To date, what is President Obama's environmental legacy? He has implemented policies that reduce fossil fuel demand: a meaningful bilateral agreement with China to cut emissions where the US agreed to cut carbon emissions 26-28% by 2025, relative to 2005 levels, efficiency standards for road vehicles and aircraft, and CO2 regulations for new power plants. However he has failed to tackle the supply side of fossil fuel, doing little to halt the rampant determination of coal, oil, and natural gas corporations to extract all the resources they can. In July 2014 Obama's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management opened up the Eastern seaboard, from Florida to Delaware, for oil and natural gas exploration. The Whitehouse boasts that it has opened up 59 million acres for oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and has increased leases for oil and gas drilling on federal land.President Obama did veto the Keystone XL pipeline but now he has given licence to Shell to drill in the Arctic. This will be the mortal sin of his administration.In his acceptance speech in 2008 President Obama pledged to make the \"planet in peril\" one of his top three priorities. In his State of the Union address in 2014 Obama said, \"Climate change is a fact. And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.\" But has President Obama really done all he could?On 3rd August President Obama announced the Clean Power Plan, an unprecedented initiative that promises to revolutionise power plant emissions, the USA's largest source of pollution. The Plan is an ambitious pledge to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the nation's power plants by 32% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.   President Obama introduced the Plan as \"the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change\". The Plan was well received: Lord Nicholas Stern, Chair of the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change called the Plan \"a very important announcement by President Obama which will reinforce the credibility of the commitment by the United States to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as a new international agreement on climate change is being finalised... It shows the determination of the world's richest country to maintain better economic growth while also cutting greenhouse gas pollution.\"The Editorial Board of the New York Times said the Plan was \"unquestionably the most important step the administration has taken in the fight against climate change\" and Michael Brune, Executive Director of the Sierra Club went further calling it \"the most significant single action any president has ever taken.\"President Obama recognised that \"[climate change] is one of those rare issues - because of its magnitude, because of its scope - that if we don't get it right we may not be able to reverse it and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently. There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change.\" Indeed there is, and all the scientific evidence indicates that we are nearly past the point of no return.In announcing the Clean Power Plan Obama quoted Governor Jay Inslee of Washington State \"We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.\" On hearing Obama introduce the Plan my hopes for COP21 were lifted. Unfortunately, my optimism didn't last long - the Plan sets achievable goals and contains several concessions.Power plants produce a third of the USA's total domestic carbon dioxide emissions. Under Obama's Plan the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives each state a goal for cutting power-plant emissions. States decide for themselves how to achieve this target. They can switch from coal to natural gas or nuclear, expand their generation of renewable energy or increase energy efficiency. All states must submit their plans by 2016-2018, start making reductions by 2022 at the latest, and continue reducing emissions through to 2030.This all sounds very promising. However under the original version of the Clean Power Plan States did not have this two-year grace period before they had to start reducing emissions. The two-year grace period would allow them to burn fossil fuels for two more years. During this time, carbon dioxide concentrations will continue to rise and the impacts of climate change will continue to be felt across the world. This concession is not just unnecessary but reckless. As Ken Kimmell, President of the Union of Concerned Scientists confirms, many \"states are already on track to cut their emissions through actions they've put in place, including state renewable energy and energy efficiency standards and coal plant retirements.\"The Plan is ambitious by the standards of America's climate commitments to date but conservative in terms of the CO2 reduction targets in line with scientific estimates required to avoid catastrophic climate change. Coal - the dirty industry most impacted by the President's Plan - is already a steadily declining contributor to the country's electricity production. According to Politico, increased electricity generation from natural gas and renewable energy sources and energy efficiency initiatives mean the USA has already met the halfway point of the goal set by the Clean Power Plan. The Plan could have gone much further.One of the most positive aspects of the Plan is its promise of 30% more renewable energy generation by 2030. But this figure is testament to the expansion of the renewable energy market, which is reliant on the federal production tax credit (PTC) incentive. Favourable conditions for solar and wind energy have enabled the pledges of the draft Plan to be increased. According to Rob Gramlich of the American Wind Energy Association the current boom requires the PTC subsidy. The draft Plan, formulated prior to the boom estimated that renewable energy would only make up 22% of the market by 2030.President Obama said the Clean Power Plan is, \"the biggest, most important step the USA has ever taken to combat climate change\". He is right but more, much more, is required if we are to keep average global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius.To put the Plan's goals in perspective, last week California passed legislation that will see the State reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. Tim O'Connor, Director of California policy for the Environmental Defense Fund said, \"This is how California can really shake up the national conversation on climate.\"In response to the President's announcement of the Plan Craig Bennett, Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth said, \"Obama's climate initiative is politically significant, but falls way short of what scientists say is required to tackle catastrophic climate change. In the face of huge US vested interests that oppose any measures on climate change, the President's plan at least pushes the issue up the agenda.... [T]hese measures are just a drop in the ocean, when a sea change in energy policy is what's desperately required. It would have been more significant if the President said no to drilling in the Arctic, and stopped his support for new fossil fuels such as fracking and tar sands.\"350.org spokesman Jamie Henn agreed that more is required. Reducing the emissions of power plants is not enough by itself: \"Taking on King Coal is the easy part ... It's standing up to Big Oil that will require real courage. That's why decisions on things like the Keystone XL pipeline, fracking and Arctic drilling are so important -- they're the true test of climate leadership for this and any future presidents.\"Hilary Clinton has promised - if elected as President - to produce 33% of America's electricity from renewable sources by 2027. This is an additional 7% to what Obama has promised by 2030. Clinton has also vowed to install half a billion solar panels by 2020. This is seven times the number of panels currently being built and would produce enough energy to power every home in America within 10 years. Clinton said, \"I personally believe climate change is a challenge of such magnitude and urgency that we need a president who will set ambitious goals\".Indeed, President Obama's Clean Power Plan and some of his environmental policies have set ambitious goals, and his expedition to the Arctic gave us reasons for optimism. Unfortunately, his decision to give the green light to Shell to drill in the Arctic has irreparably undermined his environmental legacy. I had hoped for more from President Obama.CONCLUSION We all know it is not the sole responsibility of President Obama and the USA to singlehandedly prevent catastrophic climate change but the international community is in dire need of leadership if member states are to achieve a meaningful agreement in Paris.Soon after President Obama took up office, in a 2009 speech on climate change he said, \"Our generation's response to this challenge will be judged by history, for if we fail to meet it - boldly, swiftly, and together - we risk consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe.\"COP21 is the President's last chance to put his climate change legacy back on track.We are all hoping that when COP21 takes place in Paris in December President Obama and world leaders will bring substantial commitments to the table, to achieve a global, binding climate agreement to drastically reduce emissions and slow the perilous warming of the planet. If they fail COP21 will be an appalling abdication of responsibility."}, {"title": "Navy Agrees To Limit Pacific Trainings To Protect Marine Life", "text": "The U.S. Navy estimates it inadvertently kills 155 whales and dolphins off the coasts of Hawaii and Southern California in five years. Its training exercises also injure some 2,000 marine animals over the same period.On Monday, thanks to a pair of lawsuits brought by environmental groups Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Navy agreed to limit its use of sonar and other harmful training activities in critical habitats for whales, dolphins and other marine mammals.The settlement, finalized by a federal judge in Honolulu, reconciles a decade-old debate about the Navy's sonar practices.The agreement includes limits or bans on mid-frequency active sonar and explosives in specified areas. Earthjustice attorney David Henkin said that, at great distances, sonar can disrupt feeding and communication of marine mammals. At closer distances, it can lead to deafness or even death.In April, a federal judge ruled that the Navy severely underestimated the threat of its trainings to marine mammals.Lt. Cmdr. Matt Knight, spokesman for the Navy's U.S. Pacific Fleet, said the service “faced the real possibility that the court would stop critically important training and testing.” By reaching a settlement, the Navy preserved key national security missions, he said.“Recognizing our environmental responsibilities, the Navy has been, and will continue to be, good environmental stewards as we prepare for and conduct missions in support of our national security,” Knight said.Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a release that the settlement, which will remain in place until 2018, ensures the security of naval operations while reducing the hazard to marine life.\"Our Navy will be the better for this, and so will the oceans our sailors defend,\" Suh said.Henkin said in a statement that the Navy, by agreeing to the settlement, \"acknowledges that it doesn’t need to train in every square inch of the ocean and that it can take reasonable steps to reduce the deadly toll of its activities.\"In Southern California, the Navy will no longer be able to use sonar in important habitats for beaked whales between Santa Catalina Island and San Nicolas Island, as well as in blue whale feeding areas near San Diego.In Hawaii, the agreement prohibits sonar and explosives training on the eastern side of the Big Island and north of Molokai and Maui. The environmental groups say the restrictions will protect Hawaiian monk seals and small populations of toothed whales, including the endangered false killer whale.The Natural Resources Defense Council called the settlement a \"huge victory,\" but said it won’t end the advocacy group's fight to protect marine mammals from Navy sonar.\"We’ll now work to expand this success to the Navy’s other ranges ... and to make the protections we’ve achieved permanent for marine mammals off Southern California and Hawaii,\" spokeswoman Kimiko Martinez told HuffPost.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Climate Change: A Genocide Driver, Solar Scores Again, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.Froggy Know-How: A frog can shield itself from rain, but dies when its forest home is destroyed.By threatening the world's forests, humans ultimately harm themselves.OO Annual Global Tree Loss Keeps Slowing, But Not Enough - with a loss equal in area to two Portugals in 2014, says a new report.**The Balding of Asia and Africa: New data, with help from Google, illustrate unprecedented -- and until now, largely overlooked -- forest loss in Southeast Asia and West Africa, among other hotspots.Forests: the cheapest way to store carbonOO Google Map Shows Fastest Deforestation Is Mostly In Asia, Africa* *Africans Go Hungry as richer, developed but unsustainable nations lease African cropland to grow their own food.

The differences are dramatic:Wahl explained that the role that higher temperatures are playing in the paucity of snowpack in the state was found to be stronger at lower elevations, below 7,000 feet, where the researchers estimated the current year's snowpack to be \"more on the order of a once-per-1000-year event.\"And while many climate models suggest that much of California could actually see some increased water precipitation by the latter half of the century, as global temperatures are also expected to increase, Wahl says that this doesn't change their findings because those higher temperatures are likely to cause a \"net reduction\" in soil moisture overall.Similarly, the much-anticipated \"monster\" El Nino weather event forecast to hit California in the coming months is likely to arrive during yet another warm winter season in the state. So while it may bring more rain, it's not clear that it would contribute to a larger snowpack because of that increased temperature.The scientists note that their findings are particularly bleak given that Sierra Nevada snowpack is relied on to replenish water reservoirs, providing 30 percent of the state's water supply.\"The ongoing and projected role of temperature in the amount and duration of California's primary natural water storage system thus foreshadows major future impacts on the state's water supplies,\" the paper concluded.To reconstruct snow conditions and temperatures of California's past, researchers examined regional tree-ring data stretching back to the year 1500, as well as an analysis of reporting stations in the mountain range that help to measure snowpack levels.After officials recorded record-low snowpack earlier this year, Gov. Jerry Brown (D), while standing on a dry grassy meadow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains where several feet of snow would usually sit, instituted mandatory water restrictions in the state for the first time in history.California is parched, nearing the start of the fifth year of a punishing drought. The report's findings add further context to help understand just how extreme the state's conditions have become. And while regular, even serious, droughts are not uncommon in the Golden State, global warming has been linked to the acute nature of this current event.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Obama Administration Facing More Opposition to Atlantic Drilling Plans", "text": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is facing increased pressure to change his position on drilling in the Atlantic Ocean -- and not just from environmental groups.Yes, environmental groups are against the move to expand offshore drilling. On Monday, a major coalition of environmental groups sent Obama a letter urging him to end all new leases for fossil fuels, including for offshore oil in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Arctic, as well as coal and natural gas development on public lands. The \"Keep it in the Ground\" effort says ending new leases would help prevent 450 billion tons of carbon pollution from entering the atmosphere.But the pushback on offshore drilling in the Atlantic is even broader, including a number of cities and towns along the southeast coast.The Obama administration announced in January that it will open new areas of the Atlantic to offshore lease sales under the 2017-2022 plan. That includes areas off the coast of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. That was just the first step in the process; the administration took public comment on the draft plan through March, and must still conduct an environmental impact analysis and release a final plan before the actual lease sale would be held. The Atlantic was left available for offshore drilling in 2008, when President George W. Bush lifted a presidential ban on Outer Continental Shelf development and Congress allowed its longstanding moratorium to expire.With the lease sale planning process still underway, there's a growing volume of dissent from coastal voices.Charleston, South Carolina's city council passed a resolution opposing drilling in March. Savannah, Georgia's council unanimously approved a similar resolution in April. The Wilmington, North Carolina council followed suit in July. And the Myrtle Beach city council approved an anti-drilling resolution in August, as did two North Carolina beach communities in early September. At least 75 coastal communities have taken action in opposition to drilling, according to a tally from the environmental group Oceana.\"After some soul searching, I’m not going to be a part of it,\" said Myrtle Beach Councilman Mike Lowder, the Sun News reported. \"I'm not going to support anything that's going to have the potential to destroy our beach.\"The governors of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia have all endorsed drilling. But Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, notes that opposition is growing and, in many of these areas, has been bipartisan. \"It's been a slow process of the communities waking up and saying, 'This isn't our vision for the coast,'\" said Weaver.There's growing pushback from businesses, too. A group of 300 Atlantic coastal businesses organized by the group Environment America sent the administration a letter last week citing concerns about the potential for oil spills and the harm drilling could do to other economic activity. The list included a variety of tourism, fishing and restaurant businesses.\"Offshore drilling is incompatible with our tourism and fishing industries,\" they wrote. \"The potential economic losses that new offshore drilling would bring to our existing coastal economies and the potential for damage to treasured coasts and marine resources would be devastating.\"Weaver predicts that more cities, towns and businesses along the coast will make their opposition to drilling heard: \"These are communities that know that their way of life and their economies and livelihoods depend on a clean coast.\""}, {"title": "Pyrocumulus Cloud from the California 'Rough' Wildfire", "text": "Photo: Peter Gleick 2015, taken with Samsung Galaxy S6A pyrocumulus cloud, sometimes nicknamed a \"fire cloud,\" is a cumuliform cloud produced from the intensive heating of air caused by a fire.On September 11th, as I was flying from Los Angeles to Oakland, I took this picture of the pyrocumulus cloud created from the uncontrolled \"Rough Fire\" burning east of Fresno, California (see map below).

Last year he only grew two inches, and this year he has only grown half an inch. Should I be worried?Of course not. At a certain stage of maturity, quantifiable physical growth slows and stops, and a new mode of development takes over.Imagine that I did not understand that, and fed Matthew growth hormones in a desperate attempt to keep him growing taller. And imagine that this effort was harming his health and depleting my resources. \"I have to find a way to make his growth sustainable,\" I would say. \"Maybe I can use herbal hormones.\"Our civilization is at a similar transition point in the nature of its development. For thousands of years we have grown -- in population, in energy consumption, in land under cultivation, in bits of data, in economic output. Today we are beginning to realize that this kind of growth is no longer possible, nor even desirable; that it can be maintained only at greater and greater cost to human beings and the planet.The time has come to shift to a different kind of development, development that is qualitative rather than quantitative, better and not more. I wish our policy elites would understand this. Case in point: the new U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) convey real concern and care for the environment. Yet at the same time they are wedded to the ideology of economic growth -- more GDP, more industrial infrastructure, roads, ports, etc. -- without considering whether other forms of development could better meet their goals of poverty elimination and ecological sustainability.The way out of poverty for the \"least developed countries,\" the SDG prescribes, is to develop export industries to raise GDP (targeting 7% growth). Unfortunately, in many countries this strategy has proven to be a recipe for more poverty, not less. The wealth usually ends up in the hands of local elites, the corporations who extract the resources, and the financial institutions that lend the money for the development. How else to make one's country \"attractive to investors\" but to guarantee that they will extract more money than they put in? It is no wonder that while global GDP has nearly tripled since 1990, the number of people suffering food insecurity has also risen, and the middle class has stopped growing or even shrank in many countries.Then there are the environmental consequences. What are these countries going to export, if not timber, mining products, and other natural resources, along with raw labor power? What else could the roads and ports be used for? The SDGs propose more of the same while hoping for a different result - a good definition of insanity.A closer examination of what economic growth really is will illuminate the point. Economic growth, as conventionally measured, refers only to goods and services exchanged for money. That means that when indigenous peasants or self-sufficient villagers stop growing and sharing their own food, stop building their own houses, stop making their own entertainment, etc., and instead go to work at factories or plantations and pay for all of these things, GDP rises and they are considered better off. Their cash incomes may have risen from nearly nothing to five dollars a day, but they are now at the mercy of global markets. When commodity prices plummet (as they are now), when their nation's currencies fall (as they are now), local prices rise and they are plunged into destitution. This would not happen if they retained some independence from the global commodity economy.Only if we take the standard development model for granted is economic growth a necessity to alleviate poverty. In a system where all money is created as interest-bearing debt, it is a mathematical certainty that poverty and wealth inequality will increase unless income (the ability to service debt) grows faster than the debt itself. The income of many countries and people is now falling, leaving only one option to make debt payments: austerity. Austerity and (conventional) development are two sides of the same coin. Both are geared to opening a country to export its wealth. The prescriptions of austerity - privatization of public assets, removal of trade barriers, removal of labor protections, deregulation, cutting of pensions and wages - are precisely the same as the neoliberal prescription for economic development. These measures make a country more \"attractive to investment.\"So let's stop taking this system for granted. First, let's address poverty by encouraging resiliency and independence from global markets, in particular through local food autonomy, local control of resources, decentralized political institutions, and decentralized infrastructure that isn't predicated on generating foreign exchange. Second, let's remove the underlying driver of the compulsion to monetize - the national and private debts that have been the prime implements of colonialism since explicit colonialism ended in the 1960s. (The SDGs, laudably, make mention of debt reduction. This needs to happen on a massive scale.) Third, let's start talking about fundamental reform of our broken, debt-based financial system, which both drives economic growth and requires growth to survive. It throws everyone into competition with everyone else, propelling a \"race to the bottom\" that cannot end until the entire planet has been converted into product.Switching from chemical to herbal growth stimulants (\"green\" or \"sustainable\" development) isn't going to solve the problem. If development equals growth, then \"sustainable development\" is an oxymoron. Poverty and ecocide are baked into the cake. It is time to transition to a world in which wealth no longer means more and more."}, {"title": "How To Help Animals Displaced By Northern California Wildfire Evacuation", "text": "While Northern California burns, local animal shelters and rescue groups are working hard to make sure that pets evacuated from the wildfires will stay safe -- and they can use your help.As the brutal wildfires advance, thousands of people are worrying about their homes, their neighbors and the things they left behind -- including, in some cases, their animals.For those who evacuated with their animals, staff and volunteers from Petaluma Animal Services, Wine Country Animal Lovers, the Sonoma Humane Society, Compassion Without Borders, the Jameson Rescue Ranch and a host of other nonprofits, businesses and animal-loving individuals, are working day and night to keep displaced pets fed, hydrated, housed and comfortable. They're trying to give the evacuees one less thing to worry about.\"This is a pretty scary situation,\" said Alissa McNair, vice president of Wine Country Animal Lovers. \"A lot of us are working knowing our colleagues and family members have lost their homes.\"Over the weekend, the groups involved with caring for these animals asked for donations of crates, food, collars, leashes, litter boxes, hay and other supplies. People responded so generously and swiftly that by Sunday evening, it was announced that rescuers at the fairground had enough supplies.Folks have also opened their homes to animals with nowhere to go. For example, the Sonoma Humane Society and Wine Country Animal Lovers took in animals from a shelter in neighboring Lake County, where cats and dogs had been at risk of euthanasia, to make room for fire evacuees.Instead, these pets are now safely in foster homes, said Kiska Icard, Sonoma Humane Society's executive director -- who spoke to The Huffington Post as she was heading over to the fairgrounds to take over for some other animal workers, who'd been up for more than two days straight\"The community support has been overwhelming,\" she said.There are still ongoing needs: People and animals fleeing the fire have decamped to the Moose Lodge in Clearlake Oaks, which told the Record-Bee that donations were welcome, especially food for cats, dogs and horses.“We’re trying to get a stock pile of it going so people who aren’t here who are evacuating horses can take it to where they need it,” said Moose Lodge member Rhiannon Garcia said to the newspaper. “I know there’s a lot of people that are just in the parking lots and various spots that don’t have food. They can come and pick it up and take it.”More temporary foster homes are needed, as well as permanent adopters. Look for the Lake County and other animals' listings on the Wine Country Animal Lovers and Sonoma Humane Society Facebook pages. Out-of-staters are welcome to submit adoption applications.And though Petaluma Animal Services executive director Jeff Charter hates asking -- it \"seems kind of shameless,\" he said -- financial donations are especially crucial.\"What's really helpful right now is to be able to run to the store and buy what we need,\" said Charter. \"We're able to because of all the help we're getting from the public.\"Petaluma Animal Services, Sonoma Humane Society, Wine Country Animal Lovers, Compassion Without Borders, the Moose Lodge and the Jameson Rescue Ranch are all posting regular updates to Facebook -- they'll list what supplies are currently needed and how to donate or otherwise help them protect pets affected by the fire.Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you know someone who's helping animals survive the fires, or have another animal story to share."}, {"title": "Snowpack In Sierra Nevada At 500-Year Low", "text": "California's record multiyear drought is severe, but new research suggests that, historically, it may be even worse than previously thought.In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers, calling their findings \"an ominous sign of the severity of this drought,\" found that the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range is at the lowest it has been for more than 500 years.What's worse is it may become the new normal in California.The combination of increased temperatures, low precipitation and record-low snowpack in the state altogether \"suggests that the occurrence of much reduced snowpack is likely to be less rare in the future than it has been over the past half-millennium or longer, meaning less storage of water as snow,\" Eugene Wahl, co-author of the paper and scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Huffington Post.NOAA posted these NASA satellite images of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on their website to help illustrate the severity of the report's findings -- one from 2010, the last year in the state with average winter snowfall, and one from 2015.

Textbooks used in Alabama science classes have for years carried disclaimer stickers stating that evolution is a \"controversial theory,\" not fact. The new course of study, announced on Thursday, doesn't eliminate those warnings, which were originally advocated by Christian conservatives.But the updated standards do directly support the teaching of evolution, along with the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and humans are the likely cause. Students will now be required to use scientific evidence to \"support the hypotheses of common ancestry and biological evolution,\" according to the standards, and to analyze humanity's impact on the planet and the resulting climate change.The changes were drafted by a 40-member committee over the course of three years -- including some people with \"very strong religious beliefs,\" Michal Robinson, a science specialist for the state education agency, told The Associated Press.The new curriculum will help improve scientific literacy in the state, where only 21 percent of 10th-graders meet or exceed national science testing standards. Alabama ranked 37th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in average ACT science scores last year.The changes were unanimously approved by the Republican-controlled Alabama State Board of Education. This is the first update to the state's science standards since 2005.The standards will officially go into effect during the summer of 2016. But Steve Ricks, director of the Alabama Department of Education's math and science initiative, told The Huffington Post that the state is being \"extremely proactive\" and rolling out the guidelines immediately.The new science will also be accompanied by updated teaching methods that give students a hands-on education extending beyond the textbook. Science classes will soon see a dramatic shift from traditional \"knowledge regurgitation,\" Ricks said, to \"higher-order thinking standards.\"\"The new course of study makes a major shift in the way teachers need to teach,\" Ricks said. \"No longer can a teacher take a textbook and have students just read it and answer questions. It'll require [students] to be doing science, investigating, to be actively engaged.\"\"We still have to teach what the science is,\" Robinson told the AP. \"If students want to go into a science field in college or beyond, they have to have a foundation.\"Ricks said that while the plans might not roll out perfectly, students will be getting a far better education next year. The state has already launched a program to train teachers in the new material, and he said there's already \"a lot of enthusiasm.\"As for those stickers?

The people of the earth must solve it together.That's why international climate negotiations matter, in spite of their mixed record of progress.

It ruled unanimously that the Ecuadorian communities could pursue an enforcement action with the aim of seizing Chevron's Canadian assets to cover its $10 billion liability. That means 18 appellate judges in Canada and Ecuador have now ruled against Chevron, and three more in the U.S. are currently considering following suit regarding Chevron's bogus RICO retaliation. Even Judge Kaplan, who issued that decision and ran an amazingly biased proceeding, did not exonerate Chevron for its contamination.In light of yet another of Chevron's courtroom setbacks in the Ecuador pollution case, company CEO John Watson and his management team again face a stark choice: admit defeat and prevent further death to rainforest villagers, or continue on their disastrous folly by denying the truth. How many more people will lose their lives if Chevron fights on? Chevron is already widely recognized as a global corporate criminal, it has won awards to that effect and has seen protests against it in 20 countries on a single day. Condemning more innocent people in Ecuador to suffer and die is simply inhuman.We've written before about Chevron's choice to choose profit over people in Ecuador by dumping 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon in order to save $3 per barrel. While operating as Texaco – the first to drill in the Amazon – they chose to reject pleas to safely line accumulating waste pits, stating that $4 million was too high a price to avoid poisoning local communities. That was merely one of the first of Chevron's irresponsible choices with devastating consequences.Chevron's efforts to escape justice and attack its victims are a threat to anyone harmed by similar corporate misdeeds. By using its endless resources to drag out this fight, Chevron is violating the very idea of justice. These legal actions are not simply exercises to determine who is responsible for a past crime, they are to force the company to stop committing the same deadly crime over and over. Every single day that Chevron chooses to ignore its responsibility, the health crisis deepens and environmental conditions worsen.Now thanks to the Canadian decision, CEO John Watson and Chief Counsel Hugh Pate are again faced with a choice. Will they continue their path down the “dark side” or will they finally decide to do what's right and value the lives of those in Ecuador suffering from their admitted contamination? Do 10,000 more people need to become sick with cancer because Watson can't admit what the whole world knows? Every single dollar Chevron spends trying to defend itself in Canada could be used today to clean up Ecuador, provide clean water and health services to the sick people of the Amazon.The unanimous decision of the Canadian Supreme Court sends a clear message to Watson: ultimately, Chevron will lose again. Next year, Watson will stand in front of shareholders and the board of directors and have to explain why Chevron is back in court in a nation where it holds over $15 billion of assets at risk of seizure. Chevron will also face questions in court about why they hid the fact that their own technicians found toxic contamination in allegedly remediated well sites where only Texaco had ever operated.There are many reasons why now is finally the time for Watson to finally decide to do what is right. The risk and interest grows daily in Canada. Chevron has lost $100 billion in market value in the last year. The amount Chevron owes has already increased by $500 million and will continue to increase over the course of a trial. But most importantly, Chevron can stop the ongoing deaths and environmental destruction. It has the means to end this nightmare in Ecuador and to help those people it admitted to harming when Texaco first acknowledged deliberate dumping.Any court system that examines the evidence will find that Chevron intentionally polluted the environment and perpetrated a sham remediation, as the most litigated trial in Ecuador's history determined. If John Watson chooses to invest billions to pay lawyers to fight so that eventuality takes place after he steps down as CEO, he will hold responsibility for future deaths solely on his shoulders – and conscience, if he still has one.Even Darth Vader did the right thing eventually. It didn't stop his empire from falling, but at least he reclaimed some measure of humanity in the process."}, {"title": "On My Way Home From the Trails, a Different Kind of Apocalypse", "text": "Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small That we can never get away from the sprawl Living in the sprawl Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains And there's no end in sight I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights-- The Arcade Fire, Sprawl IIWhen I lived in Charlottesville, the mountain biking trails were 15 minutes away. On a lazy Sunday afternoon, with the sun still high in the sky, I could drive a winding two-lane road through the countryside, past vineyards and horse pastures, to find trails on a hill covered by trees and streams. Now that I live in DC, getting to a park is a whole different story. It means merging into three lanes of traffic and then on to I-95 South, that conduit for long-haul truckers and inter-city drivers, laid out like a ribbon up and down the East Coast.One of the joys of mountain biking is that over time you become intimate with the trails. You get to know their nuances and rhythms: a root here, a stone there, now a steep dip and a sharp turn, and then the view of the water through the trees. It becomes familiar, and like a trusted lover, it leaves a mark on your soul, deepened over time. Eventually, you get to know its seasons and learn to appreciate the glows of different months: April with pink and tart yellow flowers, August with lush greens, October, full of crispy browns, the leaves crackling like a bowl of Chocolatey Cap'n Crunch.I like to think of the experience as a connection to place in the same way the French think about \"terroir.\" It involves something personal, and it gets better with age. It can't be just \"anywhere.\" It has to be \"somewhere\" and that \"somewhere\" follows its own patterns -- it is its own living organism, with its natural history and cast of inhabitants.It is precisely this sense of immersion in beauty and history that make the trip home from biking so jarring, as, moving away from the oasis of contained wilderness that is Fountainhead Regional Park, I am catapulted into a no-man's land of four-lane roads, tract housing, and suburban strip-malls.In his masterpiece, The Poetics of Space, French philosopher Gaston Bachelard writes:The house shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace... the house is one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories and dreams of mankind.David Gessner expresses similar thoughts. \"Why do certain places, certain homes, excite us?\" he asks in A Wild, Rank Place, his book about Cape Cod. \"The tent or teepee, the tree house or cave. The hidden cottage all our own, sketched in our minds in fuzzy pastels and rich greens.\"But many of these neighborhoods, in the Virginia suburbs to the South of DC feel like the opposite of the kind of personal history described by Bachelard. They're more like an appendage of the grid -- a system of transportation and commerce including highways and vast parking lots, with houses strewn about haphazardly as the careless afterthought of a money-making corporate imagination.Science-fiction tends to think of a hypothetical apocalypse as a great leveling -- an unpredictable force that would clear space, leave a dust bowl, render the landscape unrecognizable. Apocalypse by tract-home and strip-mall construction is slower and less cataclysmic but it too leaves an amorphous landscape -- one with little notion of up or down, left or right: few landmarks and even fewer regional distinctives, a vast expanse of boxy houses and strip malls to numb our imagination and make our soul dull. In its own way, this is an obliteration of history, because the architecture and the surroundings are so non-descript, they cannot possibly be said to be suitable containers for the dreams and aspirations of human beings.Of course, the remarkable element about human nature is that, like flowers breaking through the concrete of a parking lot, human stories can flourish almost anywhere -- in the midst of civil wars and refugee camps, and even in North-American post-industrial office parks, as Douglas Coupland demonstrated with Generation X: Tales for An Accelerated Culture. But works like Coupland's are pieces of aesthetic resistance. They are a variety of protest literature. They gather their creative burst from reservoirs of imagination stored elsewhere. What will happen when we are enveloped by office parks and soulless homes, to the point where the only artifacts of beauty are found in the museum-like preserves of a few historic city centers?It's not the development itself that is the problem. It's the manner in which it's done. And as I drive home from mountain-biking through the landscapes of Northern Virginia, I'm reminded that we need to curate the world outside our parks with the same care and attention to beauty that we do inside them. When these elements are well integrated the results can be spectacular. The Buttermilk Trail, on the banks of the James River, in the heart of downtown Richmond is an example of this. The trail itself, carved at half-bank, is stunning. What's around the trail, and the way it has been given shape, is even more remarkable: rail-road track, an urban cemetery with carved tombstones, a suspension bridge, old mansions, quaint and modest houses. The entire experience is an aesthetic masterpiece.Development and civilization are not the enemy. Without them we would have neither ultra-light mountain-bikes nor well-tended single-track. Thoughtless sprawl is the foe. What we do with our spaces, and how much thought and good taste we put into their build-out, will determine our quality of life for decades to come."}, {"title": "Polar Bear’s Shocking Appearance May Be Tied To Climate Change", "text": "A photo of an emaciated polar bear is stirring a debate about the consequences of climate change.Photographer Kerstin Langenberger of Arctic Dreams photography shared a photo on her Facebook page last month of a severely thin polar bear with protruding bones, taken in the Arctic Ocean's Svalbard region.

It was here and then someone killed it. Some said it was real, others called it a mythical beast. Today we know it is real.On my street, I see plug-in cars parked in driveways. In traffic, I see them among the other cars. This week, at the fifth annual National Drive Electric Week, over 100,000 people will gather nationwide and beyond in some 185 cities, towns, malls, and farms to celebrate this technological turning point, test-drive the vehicles, and chat with long-time owners.Plug-in cars are the future. They not only offer huge environmental benefits, but are a spectacularly disruptive technology. They don't appear all that different until you consider the billions of dollars of private and public investment and vast commitment of political will that brought them here. But make no mistake, the technological change and shift in spending patterns brought by the plug-in car will be on par with other major innovations like cell phones and the Internet.Oil is the world's most widely traded commodity. The average American household spent over $2,500 on gasoline last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The oil and gas industry makes up 7.3 percent of the U.S. economy--well over a trillion dollars a year, according to a PriceWaterhouseCoopers study. But since 2004, U.S. gasoline consumption has been slowly dropping, mostly due to improved fuel efficiency and fewer miles traveled. And that is before the plug-in cars start to really impact the market.Plug-in cars now represent 3 percent of the California car market--up from zero just three years ago. That's twice the growth rate of plug-less hybrid technology. Starting this fall with the 2016 Chevy Volt, and rolling out over the next two years, a new generation of plug-in cars is coming to market with better performance and range. Watch for that 3 percent to grow quickly. Some of the other big changes expected as plug-in car adoption accelerates:• Cleaner air: Despite tremendous improvements in vehicle emissions, air quality in many American cities still does not meet EPA standards. As our vehicle fleet becomes more electric, you'll notice it every time you breathe.• Falling oil prices: Oil prices are highly sensitive to demand. As our fleet electrifies and demand for gasoline falls, prices will fall and our economy will be less captive to wild oil price gyrations.• Fewer Middle Eastern wars: With lower prices and more available supply, oil will become a commodity like so many others (as it was before the 1973 oil embargo). ISIS and other terrorist groups will have less money to spend. When was the last time we fought a war over iron or cement, not to mention electricity?• Changing gas stations: Gasoline accounts for a small fraction of most gas stations' profit. Most comes from drinks, snacks and other conveniences. People will still want these things, but gas stations will either disappear or morph into something new and unexpected to lure customers who no longer need the pump.• Cheaper electricity: About half the cost of supplying electricity is in maintaining the grid, which is vastly underutilized at night, when power demand is lowest. But that is when most EVs will be charging. So the cost of maintaining the grid will be spread out over more kilowatt hours sold and prices may drop.• Changing electric utilities: The wireless revolution sparked a massive change in the role of phone companies. The combination of plug-in cars, rooftop solar and battery storage will do the same for our utilities. Customers will become both buyers and sellers of power. They will be mobile (imagine charging your car at home when demand is low and electricity is cheap, then using it later, or even selling it back to the utility at a profit while at work, when demand is high) and no longer captive to a single company. Just as phone companies have done, utilities will need to scramble to figure out how to adapt.• Cleaner power: Most new U.S. power is now generated by wind and solar. Look for that to continue as demand for electricity grows.• New ways to use electricity: Plug-in cars with increasingly powerful batteries can be used as a remote source of electricity, anywhere it is needed. Look for entrepreneurs to come up with all kinds of innovative uses. Who ever thought that putting cell phones together with the Internet would put a video camera or interactive road map in your pocket?• Less pressure on the global climate: Last but not least, petroleum is a big driver of global climate disruption. Electricity is not carbon-free, but it is much cleaner than petroleum and gets cleaner every year as our power mix improves.As with other disruptive technologies, the impacts of plug-in vehicles will come over time as market penetration grows and people figure out new ways to use the technology. But make no mistake, the rollout is starting to make itself felt. Over 360,000 plug-in cars have now been sold in the U.S. If you have never been behind the wheel of one, try experiencing the quiet speed, cost-savings, and convenience they offer.

The good folks at the USDA should fight for good food to be less expensive than crappy food. For carrots instead of greasy chips; maybe some whole grains instead of fractioned corn syrup. Otherwise, as both Jess and my mom know, good food is only a fantasy enjoyed by high-income folks in SoHo and San Francisco.Making it easier for families to eat healthier, cleaner meals together isn't just on the USDA.

The prison hopes providing videos of the outside world will help calm inmates in isolation and foster safety throughout the facility.The project, called the “Blue Room,” is named after and follows a similar initiative implemented by Oregon’s Snake River Correctional Institution. To help prisoners cope in isolation, the facility sought inspiration from a 2010 TED Talk by forest ecologist Nalini Nadkarni, Oregon Live reported, which stressed the importance of nature for inmates ― particularly those in solitary confinement. Often these prisoners are confined to a small cell for 23 hours a day or more, with a small amount of time allotted for recreation, like running or jogging, but it’s rarely enough of an outlet.“I’ve seen over the years how an inmate will come into the facility, and they’ll almost appear to be completely normal,” said Capt. Randy Gilbertson, who oversees Snake River’s Intensive Management Unit, as reported by Oregon Live. “After a phase of isolation, those guys ― especially those guys with mental health issues ― tend to decompensate. They break down and go a different route. And it brings out a whole different person in them.”So the facility began playing nature videos, aimed to prevent violent outbursts and reduce chaos among inmates. A Oregon Youth Authority researcher studied and compared the disciplinary records of Snake River IMU inmates before and after the Blue Room opened and found prisoners who experienced the room had slightly fewer disciplinary infractions than those who didn’t, according to Oregon Live.Washington corrections officials met with administrators at Snake River in 2014, to take on the project as their own. The Blue Room at Washington Corrections Center, about 30 miles northwest of Olympia, is a partnership with the Sustainability in Prisons Project, which has implemented similar nature-focused projects like beekeeping and gardening for inmates. Though still in the preliminary stages, the Washington facility is hopeful the projections will make a positive impact.“Whatever we can do to men and women while incarcerated to make them more human,” Nadkarni told the Associated Press, “less violent, less anxious, it seems that benefits society as a whole.”Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "These Red Panda Babies Are Too Adorable Not To Be Famous", "text": "A pair of red panda cubs born in a wildlife sanctuary in Cornwall, England, have gotten their first taste of fame.A photo released last week shows one of the cubs stepping out with mom.Rusty and Scarlett were born to mother, Jai-Li, at Cornwall's Paradise Park Wildlife Sanctuary on June 27.

What are the implications of using the sanitizing effect of aesthetic appeal to draw attention to a problem that should horrify us?Liokatis countered this question with an uncomfortable reality: \"The visually pleasing aspect of these artworks [...] effectively and creatively captures the public’s attention, and hopefully will elicit the public’s engagement.\" We're far less likely to stare in awe at a sludgy, repulsive piece of art, but the bait of a mesmerizing image constructed solely of ocean trash lures us in.In conjunction with the exhibit, Fisher is also displaying Cynthia Minet's \"Beasts of Burden,\" an ecologically minded installation drawn from her series \"Unsustainable Creatures.\" Minet's \"Pack Dogs\" is on show as part of \"Gyre.\"\"Gyre: The Plastic Ocean\" is on display at the USC Fisher Museum of Art from Sept. 2 to Nov. 21, 2015.CORRECTION:  This post has been updated to clarify that Ariadni Liokatis is curator at the USC Fisher Museum of Art.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "These Spectacular Nature Photos 'Evoke A Sense Of Time & Origins'", "text": "A new exhibition featuring the work of celebrated nature photographer Frans Lanting aims to tell the natural history of Earth -- from the first stirrings of life to the incredible biodiversity seen on our planet today.\"My mission was to create images of nature -- from volcanoes to tree frogs -- that could evoke a sense of time and origins,\" Lanting said in a written statement. \"I wanted to apply both new scientific ideas to my subjects and new photographic concepts to my images.

You shall have them for food.\" \"My wife and I looked at each other and said, 'We're supposed to be vegetarian,'\" says Cohan.The two gave up meat on the spot and ultimately went vegan. Having grown up in a household where meat was served \"at every meal,\" Cohan found going meatless was surprisingly easy and \"totally transformative.\" He not only felt better, it resonated with him spiritually.Cohan had been raised Jewish, but vaguely so, in a secular family. \"I was struggling with Jewish liturgy. My spirituality hadn't developed yet, the High Holidays were tedious for me.\" Jewish Veg's executive director since 2012, Cohan says, \"The amazing thing about going vegan is it changes the way you interact with people and animals. We truly see the world in a different, beautiful way.\"Many of Jewish Veg's members first approach giving up meat to boost their health. They've got a great resource with the nonprofit's advisers including Dr. Joel Kahn and Nutrition Facts' Dr. Michael Greger. Increasingly, though, the interest is in animal rights, the environment and of course, ethics, wanting to live and eat in sync with Judaism's tenets. JewishVeg, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this fall provides information and support for whatever's driving your passion, whether you're looking for a Jewish vegan partner or looking for a veganized version of a cherished holiday recipe.\"We don't have to give up any of our Jewish favorites,\" says Cohan. \"You can have brisket, but it doesn't have to be made animal flesh. Do it using seitan. You've got the same sauce, same onions, it will be just as delicious, you'll feel better about it and you'll be healthy.\"I'd add the real special sauce is us. We knot food and feelings together all the time. What we want -- especially at the holidays -- is love, celebration, togetherness, a sense that everything's going to be all right. The key is choosing how to best express it. It doesn't come from brisket. It comes from us. That's what we bring to the table. A meal that causes no harm to others only furthers that love.\"Nobody supports cruelty to animals. People want to be healthier, too,\" says Cohan. \"One of the beautiful things about being vegan is it eliminates\" any conflict between \"our values and our actions.\"Ready to make a change? Now's the time. \"Rosh Hashanah is the most opportune time for action, a prime opportunity to engage in some soul-searching and to look at everything we're doing,\" says Cohan. \"By starting the new year with a vegan meal, you're aligning yourself with the highest ideals of the Jewish religion, starting the year in the most compassionate way possible.\"Vegan Date Honey"}, {"title": "Arctic Oil Drilling: Deluding Communities About the Benefits of Resource Extraction", "text": "President Obama's recent trip to Alaska focused renewed attention on oil drilling in the frozen north. Alaska's oil bounty has long kept state taxes low and has created employment for people working in and around the local energy industry. The problem with an overreliance on resource extraction for wealth is that it leads to a boom and bust cycle caused by fluctuating prices. Oil prices are quite volatile and are driven by speculation and unpredictable supply and demand. Sometimes the problem with resource extraction is not volatility, but reduced demand. The coal communities of West Virginia are in the midst of a long-term decline and the oil towns in Alaska will eventually suffer the same fate. Unless the wealth from resource extraction is invested locally in a sustainable, long-term business, the decline is not a matter of if, but when.Writing about Shell's effort to drill for oil in the arctic, Steven Mufson of the Washington Post reported that while the Wilderness Society and other environmental groups oppose the drilling:...Shell has received support in the debate over drilling vs. climate change from many Alaska Natives. They acknowledge climate change but say the threat it poses to their subsistence fishing culture means they need some other source of economic welfare. And new oil development is the only option.Mufson quotes geologist Richard Glenn, a director of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, who observed that:\"Climate change is real, but let's say we don't develop. Climate change continues with or without us, then who's going to build schools for our grandchildren,\" He added that the borough government on the North Slope \"depends on oil and gas as the only tax base we have. What we have is what we have. We depend on development.Shell has invested billions in exploring for oil and if sufficient quantities of petroleum are found, the company would invest additional billions in the infrastructure needed to extract and ship the oil. The risks posed by oil development to the fragile local ecology will be substantial--no matter how careful the industry is and how vigilant government regulators manage to be. Some local folks seem willing to take the risk in order to receive the benefits of development. Others feel trapped between the need for economic opportunity and the dangers posed by this inherently risky business.Some of the wealthiest companies in the world and some of the richest people in the world have made lots of money by extracting resources from the earth. These businesses will continue, and our need for material resources will never end. But they are becoming a declining portion of most nations' GDP. This is because the high value-added part of the economy is built on ideas, information and technology. Many companies understand this. For example, IBM, once the market dominator in personal computers, got out of the business when they saw PCs becoming interchangeable commodities. They saw a future of declining profit margins and felt their talents could bring higher rates of return in other areas of business.The development of electric cars and renewable energy poses a deep threat to the fossil fuel industry. The oil companies know this and that is why some deny the existence of climate change and lobby ferociously to keep the energy industry locked into 20th century technology. They need to recover the billions they have invested in fossil fuel leases, extraction equipment, and fuel transportation infrastructure. Some will manage to profit from their investments, but some won't. The future of the fossil fuel industry depends on the rate of innovation and advances in renewable energy technology, and the further development of energy storage and smart-grid technologies.I am betting that human ingenuity and the huge profits to be made in developing new technologies make them inevitable. Moreover, it strikes me that the fossil fuel business is on the wrong side of history. Yes, extraction technology has advanced rapidly, but the fuel being extracted must still be paid for. And even though there is plenty of fossil fuel in the ground, it is still quite finite. The last time I checked, sunshine was still free and will be around for a very long time. When the underlying fuel is free, then price is simply a matter of the cost of technology. As technology gets better, the price of renewable energy will go down. Fossil fuels have the opposite long-term trajectory: as the fuel gets less plentiful and more difficult to extract and ship, its price will go up. Of course, when fossil fuels are replaced by renewable sources, their value will crash and then their price will go down. More likely, a small amount of these hydrocarbons will retain value and be used to manufacture plastics and other materials that take advantage of their unique properties.The problem with Alaska's economic strategy is that it is based on the economic facts of the past rather than the projections of the future. The choice is not between extracting fish or extracting oil. There are other options. Alaska is a unique and special place. The state and its people need to develop their niche in the global economy. I would not pretend to know the state well enough to suggest what that might be, but if they place their bet on the fossil fuel industry, they should be prepared for a brief period of growth followed by a long period of decline.I am not arguing against all resource extraction. We continue to need resources that the earth provides and someday we may even mine other planets. But communities that rely on mining alone, or even depend on resource extraction as their primary source of revenue, are asking to be left behind in the modern global economy. As the economy evolves, mechanized manufacturing, industrial agriculture, and increased consumption of less material intensive goods and services are fundamentally changing how we spend our time at work and at leisure: Movies, recorded music, video games, live sports and entertainment events, tourism, internet-based messaging, audio and video chatting take up more of our time and treasure and those trends will continue to grow.The other morning I walked by Riverside Park in New York City and watched a small movie studio set up shop on the street to make a film. I saw about a dozen trailers, huge portable lights and filming equipment, dressing rooms and well over a hundred people at work. A few decades ago, \"location\" filming was more primitive and represented a smaller proportion of the media's outputs. These portable movie studios provide an example of the agility and flexibility needed to compete in the global economy. Over the past half century, New York City has seen its manufacturing base in clothing, small electronics, printing and similar goods replaced by education, health care, public relations, media, software, consulting and hundreds of service specialties. Finance remains, but it is a smaller proportion of New York's service economy. The High Line, New York's most visited new park, symbolizes that change. Once an elevated train that moved freight from the docks to the west side's small factories, today it is a magnet for tourists. The docks are gone and so are the factories. The factory lofts now house high tech start-ups, residents and restaurants. The docks have moved to New Jersey and been replaced along the Hudson by parks and cafes.Alaska's economy must diversify and get into sync with the changes now underway in the world economy. Resource extraction attracts people, money and jobs. Local communities must build the schools, roads and the other infrastructure needed to house the new immigrants. When the boom goes bust, the local community is stuck with the bill for the half-empty school and underutilized power plant. Drilling in the arctic is a short-term, shortsighted economic strategy that will ultimately damage the state's ecology, beauty and communities. People clearly feel they have no alternative if they are to survive economically. I believe they are wrong."}, {"title": "President Obama: Please Include the Environment in Your Speech to the  CBC!", "text": "When President Obama speaks at the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Phoenix Awards Dinner this Saturday, Sept. 19, he will address thousands of the most influential African Americans in our country. He will no doubt raise issues commonly identified as Black interests: crime and the justice system; voting rights and what's at stake in the upcoming elections. But if he also introduces the subjects of climate change and conservation of our clean air, water and parks, it could send shock waves through the Black community.President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are wildly popular at the 2013 Phoenix Awards Dinner. CBCF photo.Lest you think that's hyperbole, consider that the Congressional Black Caucus has among the highest pro-environment voting record of any bloc, according to the League of Conservation Voters' Scorecard. This year, the CBC Legislative Conference has several panels focusing on energy, climate and the Great Outdoors. Yet these members of Congress seldom raise the issue of environment with their constituents back home, deferring to what they consider \"more pressing issues\" listed above.The effect is that many African Americans believe they have little to do with the environment and it has little to do with them. My husband Frank and I have been told many times that \"people with more time and money will take care of that.\" It would be laughable if it weren't so dreadfully serious an oversight. African Americans are on the front lines of climate change impacts; suffer higher rates of air and water pollution than other communities; benefit little from the health and recreational assets in our national and local parks and forests; and are only minimally represented in the conservation workforce.Just by mentioning the environment in this setting, President Obama would instantly identify it as an issue with which Black Americans must be concerned. The message coming from the height of our nation's leadership could not be ignored. It could instigate a whole new era of interest and involvement at a pivotal time for our climate and our heritage.Fourth graders having a wonderful time discovering their public lands, thanks to the Obama administration.President Obama has the credentials to do it. Over the past seven years, he has protected significant new national parks and monuments, including the Pullman National Monument in Illinois; the Col. Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio; the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland, and the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in California. These new parks recognize the contributions of non-white Americans and celebrate them appropriately alongside America's most cherished icons in the National Park System.This month he launched \"Every Kid in a Park,\" program that provides passes for every fourth grader, allowing their entire family free access to public lands and water for an entire year.He is pushing Congress to reauthorize and dedicate full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which for 50 years has used oil and gas fees to create parks and playgrounds in urban and rural communities in every county. He finalized the Clean Water Rule - extending protections to the sources of drinking water for one in three Americans - a move celebrated by mayors and grassroots organizations nationwide.Most important, the President has a strong record of helping the country move away from fossil fuels and address climate issues. The Clean Power Plan will boost economic opportunity and the quality of life for Americans across the country. Granting permission last month for Shell Oil to drill in the Arctic Ocean is his single incomprehensible lapse.Twenty years ago, when Frank and I first got involved in conservation, several white leaders bemoaned to us that \"African Americans and other minorities and poor people have too many 'survival' issues to be concerned about the environment.\" As much as the world has changed in two decades, many Black and white people still hold this view. The recent Green 2.0 Report from the University of Michigan showed an intractable \"glass ceiling\" that keeps non-white participation at an alarming 12 -15% level in the workforce of conservation organizations, public lands management agencies and the philanthropic organizations that undergird them.Simultaneously, huge decisions being made about our \"protected\" parks and public lands show them to be incredibly vulnerable to politics. Republican leaders with pro-environmental voting records under 20 percent are proposing to weaken air and water protections, strip the President of his authority to conserve our history and heritage, and sell off our public lands.Our panel at the CBC Conference, \"Public Lands, Environment & Conservation: Peril & Opportunity for African Americans,\" Sept. 16, noon - 2 p.m., will show how the environment intersects with economic and physical wellbeing, climate, justice and culture. The President can do the same.I am optimistic that President Obama will take this opportunity to flag the environment as a vital issue for the African American community and usher in a new age of involvement and leadership.#CBCFALC15"}, {"title": "Syrian Refugee Carries Kitten Across The Sea To Greece", "text": "A photograph of a Syrian refugee cradling his pet kitten has gone viral on Twitter this week.According to reports, the unidentified man carried the young cat from his homeland across the Mediterranean Sea to Lesbos in Greece.Greek news outlet Protothema says the man in the photograph traveled to Europe with few other possessions.

In such a scenario, the entire ice sheet covering Antarctica, as well as every bit of land ice on Earth, would melt.Winkelmann spoke to The New York Times on Friday about her team's research, which found the rate of melting could occur far more quickly than scientists had expected. Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and co-author of the paper, told NPR the planet could see 2 or 3 feet of sea level rise this century if current trends continue.But then the rates will start to increase exponentially, and within 1,000 years, \"we'll have something like 100 feet of sea level rise ... which means basically abandoning most of the major cities of the world.\"The researchers found that as the rest of the world's ice continued to melt, sea levels would be pushed upwards nearly 200 feet in total.The Times noted many of the world's metropolises would lie underwater should this degree of sea level rise occur. Sydney, Rome, Tokyo, New York, Amsterdam, Beijing, Berlin and Paris would all be at risk, as well as wide swaths of Europe, Asia and the East Coast of the United States.“This is humanity as a geologic force,” Caldeira told the Times. “We’re not a subtle influence on the climate system -- we are really hitting it with a hammer.”The new research comes just a few months ahead of the highly anticipated Paris climate summit, where hundreds of world leaders and scientists are expected to hash out sweeping new goals to tackle the growing scourge of climate change.

Sadly, California also provides evidence that this isn't sufficient.We all know that however impressive California's steps to date have been, they are nowhere near enough to reach the dramatic reductions in carbon emissions necessary to prevent the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Governor Jerry Brown and Senate Leader Kevin De León just threw in the towel on efforts to take additional steps by legislating a 50% reduction in oil use by cars and trucks by 2030. De León explained that he could not win support of enough of his Democratic colleagues in the legislature because lawmakers \"could not cut through\" a massive advertising campaign by oil companies.It's important for oil company executives and shareholders to make their perspectives known when it comes to legislation that could affect their industry and their profits. But it is just as important for people who may fall victim to forest fires, floods, crop losses, drought damage, loss of tourism dollars, disease, and ecosystem disruption to have their perspectives heard. One Sacramento Bee columnist pointed out just how imbalanced the speech that Assembly Member Jim Cooper and the voters in his district was hearing, noting that he had benefitted from nearly a million dollars in campaign ads that were paid in large part by the oil industry. Another article pointed out the huge imbalance in lobbying between petroleum interests and those urging a reduction in carbon emissions.Some pundits would have us believe that the massive imbalance of paid speech is just fine, so long as it's all properly disclosed (as it appears to have been in this case.) But can any of us make wise decisions when we hear five times more from one side in a debate than another? Newspaper columnists fantasize that voters can hold legislators accountable if they \"line up on the wrong side of history\" and vote with the oil industry after raking in their cash, but the California legislature has a habit of not forcing such a public vote. Bill sponsors keep private tallies and only take a bill to the floor if they have the votes to pass it. If they don't, they spare legislators like Cooper any need to take a public position which he could be held accountable for.It's a shame that Senator De León didn't succeed, but he could have done voters a favor by at least putting all his colleagues on record."}, {"title": "FDA Moves On Food Safety A Mere Three Years Behind Schedule", "text": "The Food and Drug Administration released historic food safety regulations on Thursday that will force food manufacturers to implement major reforms to reduce the risk that their products will make people sick. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 48 million Americans contract a foodborne illness every year, 3,000 of whom end up dying.The new regulations, which cover packaged and processed foods from applesauce to ziti, stem from the Food Safety Modernization Act that President Barack Obama signed into law in January 2011.Food safety advocate Sandra Eskin of the Pew Charitable Trusts hailed the release as \"a big step forward for food safety and public health.\"\"For the first time, we have rules that require food processors to take steps to identify risks and do something to reduce them,\" she said.The rules, which go into effect in 2016, were notoriously overdue. The FSMA mandated that new standards be released by July 2012, but they were delayed time and time again. In the three years since that deadline, a number of high-profile outbreaks of foodborne illness have been linked to foods that would have been covered by the rules, most notably Blue Bell ice cream and Sunland peanut butter.Officials from the FDA and the Obama administration's Office of Management and Budget said they needed the extra time to make sure that the rules were written correctly, with input from all stakeholders, given that they make up the biggest overhaul of food safety regulations in a generation. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents many of the companies most affected by the new rules, praised the FDA for the \"deliberative and inclusive approach it took in developing these regulations.\"The fact that these regulations were released now, rather than even later, is due in part to a lawsuit by the Sacramento-based Center for Food Safety. A district judge in northern California ruled that the FDA had \"unlawfully withheld\" the rules for too long, ordering the agency to release the regulation on preventive controls for human food -- the one released this week -- by August 30. Technically, the FDA missed even this deadline, but the Center for Food Safety's attorney George Kimbrell said the group was \"pleased\" that the regulations came in when they did.\"Without our case and it's injunction, no doubt we would still be waiting,\" Kimbrell told The Huffington Post.The key measure in the rules is a requirement that food manufacturers write up -- and follow -- detailed plans that identify possible sources of pathogens and establish ways to prevent those pathogens from making it into food. Such plans have been mandated for producers of packaged seafood since 1995, and for juice producers since 2001. The new regulations released this week will require the plans for almost every food found in the middle aisles -- but not the perimeter -- of the grocery store. Meat and dairy products are regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture, rather than the FDA, while fresh produce is governed by a separate FSMA regulation.Food safety advocates were pleased to find that the final rules also require that most manufacturers test their facilities and finished products for pathogens. Eskin said that she sees this testing as \"a fundamental piece of a prevention-based system,\" because without it, there's no way to know whether a company's food safety protocols are actually working.In short, Eskin said, \"There were some little things we wish had been included, but the bigger picture is that these are very strong rules.\"Still, the enthusiasm of many food safety advocates has been tempered by their long-held belief that the FDA lacks the resources to ensure that manufacturers actually obey the regulations when they take effect a year from now. Though the FDA's food safety budget has increased since FSMA passed, many believe it hasn't increased enough to ramp up the frequency and rigor of inspections even to the relatively modest level required by the law.\"The real question is how do you enforce it,\" said famed food safety lawyer William Marler. \"We’re asking companies to implement the rules with very little oversight. Is that ultimately going to be sufficient to make our food supply safer? The jury is still out.\"Marler also noted that the FDA has become far more willing to harshly prosecute food safety violations since Obama came to office. This summer, executives of the Peanut Corporation of America were found guilty of knowingly selling salmonella-tainted peanut butter that sparked a food poisoning outbreak that killed at least nine people. The plant's former owner now faces life imprisonment, which is unprecedented in the history of American food safety. Marler speculated that the looming threat of personal punishment for infractions could spur executives to take the rules seriously, even if the chance of inspection is low.The FDA also released its final versions of regulations for the production of animal food on Thursday. Further FSMA regulations on topics including produce and imported food are expected in the next few months.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Squid Skin Is Way Weirder Than You Ever Imagined", "text": "Does squid skin have a mind of its own?

When Rosen does this, the chromatophores on that side immediately relax and shrink to tiny spots, while the chromatophores on the intact side continue to flash normally. After a few days, some of the chromatophores on the paralyzed side began to move again, as if they were getting a signal from somewhere other than the squid’s brain.As the video above shows, the results suggest that the color change in squid skin can perhaps occur intentionally or involuntarily. Amazing!But let's take it one step further. Color change for camouflage requires an awareness of surroundings. This means that in the involuntary sense, it's as if the squid skin itself can see. Not a bad sense to have when you're trying to survive in the wild.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Rethinking the American Dream Ahead of the Paris Talk", "text": "The other day I spotted an Asian woman taking things from a bin near downtown San Francisco where I live. It is not an unusual sight but the woman had on a conical hat and, upon inquiries, it turned out that she's from my own homeland, Vietnam.Abandoned by her husband and raising two kids, she survives doing menial jobs and making use of what others throw away. \"In Vietnam no one leaves this stuff on the street,\" the woman told me, gesturing towards the bottles, cans and cartons filling the bins. \"It's all money back home.\" Her frugal mindset is typical when you grow up in a world where nothing ever goes to waste. \"You can feed an army of homeless off this city's garbage,\" she said.I knew all this but I left Vietnam long ago, and had forgotten it. But the contrast between the poorest of the poor living off the waste of the wealthy made me think.Once upon a time frugality was also a virtue in America, but that no longer seems to be the case. These days the average American produces about 130 pounds of garbage each month. And a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council released in 2012 also confirmed that Americans \"waste 10 times as much food as someone in south-east Asia, up 50 percent from Americans in the 1970s.\"It doesn't surprise me given that the US has less than five percent of the world's population, yet it consumes more than 30 percent of the world's energy resources and generates 70 percent of the total global toxic waste. \"If everyone on the planet consumed at US rates, we would need three to five planets to support our consumption,\" stated the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.More than two-third of the American economy is now based on consumption; environmentalist David Suzuki called it the \"feel-good economy.\" Over time it has created an unprecedented global crisis. Worse still, it is coveted and replicated the world over - soon the pressure on the ecosystem may prove to be unsustainable.Our commercial culture requires continuous acquisition, and is built upon the concept of disposable goods. If everything is disposable, so reasoned economists after the Second World War, the market will never be saturated. New models should come out all the time so that what's functional quickly becomes obsolete.Garbage production in the United States has doubled in the last 30 years alone. Approximately 80 percent of all US products are used once, then thrown away, while 95 percent of all plastic, two-thirds of all glass containers, and 50 percent of all aluminum cans are never recycled, but instead get burned or buried.We now know we need to change, but like many an overweight person who wants to diet and exercise, we, as a nation, haven't found the will to break the habit.Garbage has become the legacy of our era. The largest human-made structure used to be the Great Wall of China. Today it's the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - the enormous swirl of plastic that gathers in the ocean currents between California and Hawaii.These days there are new efforts to render trash into reusable goods - from building materials to electronic goods - but Americans remain as wasteful as ever.And while I want to be on the right side of the environmental equation - I practice recycling, for example, and have stopped eating red meat - I too am caught in the economic infrastructure that depends of buying new goods, owning iPhones and laptops.Ahead of the crucial climate talks in Paris this December, we need to do more than lobby our governments to reduce fossil fuel emissions. We also need to look at our own slavish commitment to what Pope Francis calls \"compulsive consumerism\".Watching the woman scurrying away with her loot of rubbish it occurred to me that the real battle ahead is vital, whether or not we as a global society have the collective will to change our destructive behaviour before it is all too late.Andrew Lam is an editor with New America Media and author of the \"Perfume Dreams: Reflections on the Vietnamese Diaspora,\" and \"East Eats West: Writing in Two Hemispheres.\" His latest book is \"Birds of Paradise Lost,\" a short story collection, was published in 2013 and won a Pen/Josephine Miles Literary Award in 2014."}, {"title": "Dolphin Body-Slams Surfer, Proves They're Just As Clumsy As We Are", "text": "Some dolphins, it seems, are cursed with two left flippers.This past Labor Day, Matt Minich was stand-up paddle-boarding with his buddy at a southern California beach when he saw three dolphins nearby lining up to surf a wave.

In the Jewish calendar, the year ends in September, and the Sabbatical year (in Hebrew 'Shmita') is a once in seven year rest observed by some Jews in Israel based on teachings of the Bible. This stock market fall-Sabbatical year linkage occurred this year, when the global stock market dropped significantly, losing over three trillion dollars worth of wealth.In Rabbi Yedidya Julian Sinclair's blog post \"Shmita and the Stock Market\"he cites the remarkable fact noted by the Christian author Jonathan Cahan, that \"the final day of both of the last two Shmita years saw two of the three largest falls in history (measured in points not in per cent) of the US stock market...What seems to be happening is that some of the wealth we thought we are generating by working in the seventh year and constantly growing is getting erased at the end of the Sabbatical year. The rhythm of working for six years and resting in the seventh, writes Rabbi Sinclair:is obstinately embedded in human economic life. We are built to strive and struggle, to invest and innovate, to conceive and create for periods of around six years. During that time we are apt to get energized, excited and sometimes completely carried away by the whole business. The seventh year is meant to be a reset, a return to the real values that underpin our increasingly frantic efforts. If the reset is not expected, (and it usually isn't), experience shows that it comes upon us anyway, as a nasty surprise.The Sabbatical year can be such a positive force. There is such a tremendous potential for a society-wide-resting to take place, in order for us to connect to the inner riches of our souls. To connect with each other, to families, communities, to the nation as a whole. Observance of the Sabbatical year can help reorient our way of thinking and worldview and thereby address one of the spiritual roots of the environmental crisis-- constantly doing without taking sufficient time for reflection on our doing. At a societal level, Rabbi Michael Lerner explains in an article in Torah of the Earth how it may well be possible for an industrial technological society to observe the Sabbatical year.The first chapter of Genesis teaches that the Creator embedded within creation a cycle of seven: six units of work, one of rest. The Bible teaches that this is supposed to take place each week and every seven years. Rabbi Abraham Kook taught in his Introduction to the Sabbath of the Land that \"creation was not complete until rest was made to complement and balance creative activity.\"Yet modern society is focused on growth, which it has maintained steadily for decades in some countries. China's GDP has increased every year since 1976 (as measured in Chinese yuan and purchasing power parity). The Israeli economy has been growing every year since 2004 including during the Sabbatical years of 2007-8 and 2014-5. This year in Israel the Sabbatical year is primarily observed in the agricultural sector by some observant Jewish farmers. About 98 percent of Jewish Israelis work in non-agricultural jobs, and continue to work since the Sabbatical year has been interpreted over the millennia as only applying to farmers.When work continues uninterrupted by conscious rest, the work can become damaging to the doer and the surroundings. Edward Abbey said that \"growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.\" If we go on working without taking a major break to rest, we run the risk of becoming human doings instead of human beings.The Islamic Declaration on Climate Change, released in Istanbul last month, links the growth mentality to the ecological crisis. It states, \"We recognize the corruption (fasād) that humans have caused on the Earth due to our relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption. Its consequences have been - Global climate change... Soil erosion, deforestation and desertification.\" This was presciently foreseen 45 years ago by Saint John Paul II, who said \"the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitely turn against man.\" (Address to FAO, 1970)Dr. Herman Daly, the father of Ecological Economics, states that the economy cannot grow infinitely within the finite system of planet Earth. He saw growth as a temporary process required to reach a sufficient level of wealth, which would thereafter be maintained more or less in a steady state. Yet most modern neoclassical economists hold that growth should always continue, and this is the mainstream view of the global economic system. That is why when the stock markets crash, it is such a shock to the public.Pope Francis, in his Encyclical Laudato Si: Care for Our Common Home, calls on humanity to \"finally leave behind the modern myth of unlimited material progress. A fragile world, entrusted by God to human care, challenges us to devise intelligent ways of directing, developing and limiting our power.\" (paragraph 78) He says that we are lacking \"a culture and spirituality genuinely capable of setting limits and teaching clear-minded self-restraint.\" (paragraph 105)Let us not underestimate what religion has to offer to address the ecological crisis. Spiritual awareness can enable a person, a society and all of humanity to reflect on growth and assess when it is healthy and when it is unhealthy. This is what the Sabbatical year is supposed to enable us to do. Human beings have that ability; a cancer cell does not. Growth can be healthy, or it can become \"a growth\" that ultimately eats up the host that is supporting it.Our growth needs to be intentional, and done in a way that promotes values of peace, justice, and care. If religion can live up to its potential, it can address the ecological crisis from the roots on up. As Pope Francis said in his groundbreaking Encyclical (paragraph 161), \"the effects of the present imbalance can only be reduced by our decisive action, here and now.\" We as individuals and as a collective need to decide very soon what future we seek for ourselves and all species."}, {"title": "Unique Birth Photography Shows How Babies Fit Inside Their Mothers' Wombs", "text": "Dutch birth photographer Marry Fermont has a unique approach to documenting delivery.

This year the season broke tourism records across the Southeast, with visitors to the East Coast's beaches, hotels, surf and tackle shops spending more in many states than ever before.But if President Obama's plans to expand oil and gas drilling come to fruition, future summers might not look so bright. That's why more than 300 East Coast businesses--from restaurants and fishmongers to realtors and woodworkers--issued a letter to the president this week, urging him to drop his proposal for oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic.Since January, when Obama's Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management announced its proposal to allow drilling leases off the Atlantic Coast from Virginia to Georgia beginning in 2017, opposition to the dangerous plan has mounted.Half a million Americans submitted comments against the proposal, record numbers of which were submitted in person. Scores of beach towns and cities have passed resolutions against it, including two more in North Carolina just this week. Hundreds of other local elected officials and members of Congress have weighed in to stop the plan.And now, add to the growing chorus of opposition hundreds of small businesses whose livelihood depends on healthy marine life and a clean coast.\"For the sake of our beaches, coastal communities and the significant boon coastal tourism provides to our economy, we the undersigned local business leaders are strongly opposed to drilling for oil off the Atlantic Coast,\" the businesses wrote.After all, the coast is not just where we surf, sunbathe, and watch for sea turtles; it's also a vital economic engine. According the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, coastal tourism in East Coast states generates $4 billion in total economic activity annually and supports over one million jobs.   Oil and gas drilling was banned for decades and currently isn't permitted in the Atlantic, where the lack of industrial development on the coastline has helped allow a host of tourism businesses to flourish, from fishing and surfing, to vacation rentals and restaurants.Allowing drilling off the Atlantic Ocean -- even absent a major accident -- would pollute our beaches and change the face of our coastline. \"When you drill, you spill, and day to day drilling operations result in chronic pollution and the industrialization of the coast for oil facilities,\" the businesses wrote in their letter.And then there's the threat of a catastrophic spill. The BP Deepwater Horizon disaster took a major toll on businesses in the Gulf, costing an estimated $22 billion in lost tourism in the region through 2013. As Cola Vaughan, a realtor in the Outer Banks who signed the letter to the president, told reporters: risking his state's clean beaches to the threat of a major spill is a \"reckless gamble.\"A gamble indeed, and for what? The Energy Information Administration estimates the Atlantic Coast has 209 days worth of oil and 13 months worth of gas. As hundreds of businesses who wrote to President Obama can attest: our coastline is worth much more unsullied.The good news is that while the Obama administration's proposal to allow Atlantic drilling is dangerous, it's far from a done deal. Join us to urge the president to save our coasts and save our summers by dropping his reckless plans for oil and gas drilling."}, {"title": "Remembering The Bravery Of The 9/11 Rescue Dogs", "text": "It's been 14 years since the day the hijacked planes hit the twin towers.

It's an environmental disaster, or an environmental savior. It creates jobs and wealth...and earthquakes. Or maybe it doesn't. It's a bridge to the alternative energy future that's worth its messiness, or maybe it isn't. The latest headlines have at least one state banning the practice at the same time as some environmental activists are singing its praises. In other words, there's a lot going on.The hydraulic fracturing technique is about 60 years old, and emerged in the Midwest as a way to squeeze every drop of available crude oil from a spent well. The basic idea: blast water and sand down the pipe to push oil out. Today, the procedure, which now can also harvest natural gas trapped in shale, is a more scientific and surgical. Deep wells are dug (they extend far below the water table, advocates are quick to point out) and then turn horizontally to seek out gas-rich shale. Water and chemicals are pumped down under great pressure to fracture--frack--the rock and release the natural gas, which is then collected. For a country that is increasingly turning away from oil and toward natural gas for its electricity generation, fracking is one way to keep a steady and relatively inexpensive supply of gas flowing.However, all it takes is one YouTube video of tap water bursting into flames (because of fracking's release of methane, a very bad greenhouse gas) to convince a majority of environmentalists that when it comes to fracking, something just ain't quite right. It's those kinds of images that inspired Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono to write a little ditty called \"Don't Frack My Mother\" and to invite Jimmy Fallon to sing along.A STATEWIDE BANConcern about fracking led to its first statewide ban in New York in late June, a ban that took seven years to wind its way past legions of passionate stakeholders. \"After years of exhaustive research and examination of the science and facts, prohibiting high-volume hydraulic fracturing is the only reasonable alternative,\" New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joe Martens said in a statement. \"High-volume hydraulic fracturing poses significant adverse impacts to land, air, water, natural resources, and potential significant public health impacts that cannot be adequately mitigated.\"In this case, state leaders proved to be more concerned about air and water pollution, unknown health threats, and even earthquakes than they were about the jobs and wealth that will now never be created in the some of the state's most depressed regions. Naturally, the American Petroleum Institute was displeased. \"Hydraulic fracturing is a proven, 60-plus-year-old process that has been done safely in over one million American wells,\" Karen Moreau, executive director of the New York branch of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement. \"Surging production of natural gas is a major reason U.S. carbon emissions are near 20-year lows.\"THE EPA'S VERDICTMoreau correctly pointed out that earlier in June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a fairly favorable report that focused mainly on concerns about the contamination of both surface water and groundwater due to fracking. (It didn't look at other burning issues such as air pollution and earthquakes.)Some interesting tidbits from the report:And the EPA's money quote:We conclude there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. We did not find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systematic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. Of the potential mechanisms identified in this report, we found specific instances where one or more mechanisms led to impacts on drinking water resources, including contamination of drinking water wells. The number of identified cases, however, was small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells.The EPA seems to agree with fracking advocates that tight regulation and common standards for safe well construction could alleviate most of the concern about fracking's potential threat to water supplies.ABOUT THOSE EARTHQUAKES...But what about the earthquake threat? Oklahomans who think that earthquake damage to their homes was caused by gas operations such as fracking now have the right to sue the driller. So said the Oklahoma Supreme Court in June when it handed a defeat to oil company lawyers who didn't want such suits to make it to court. Experts are still split on to what extent fracking can be directly connected to the increasing number of earthquakes in Oklahoma and elsewhere, but now litigants can at least debate it in open court, giving fracking's opponents a new legal weapon to use in their fight.The original plaintiff was Sandra Ladra, who was injured when chunks of rock fell from her fireplace during a November 2011 earthquake. The defendants: Tulsa-based New Dominion LLC and Cleveland, Oklahoma-based Spess Oil Co. Ladra has an increasing amount of science on her side, including a joint study by the University of Oklahoma, Columbia University, and the U.S. Geological Survey focusing on the impact of high-powered wastewater injection. There's also the experience of everyday Oklahomans, who are now noticing a daily average of 10 small earthquakes, a phenomenon that didn't start until the 2009 proliferation of fracking in the state.IS FRACKING GREEN?And yet, despite all these concerns about fracking, there's a school of economic/environmental thought that contends fracking makes green sense, at least for now. Why? Because generally speaking, natural gas is cleaner to burn than coal, so if fracking can help kill off coal faster, it's worth it. It's easier and cheaper, the economists explain, to move from coal to gas and then to alternative energy than to try to leap from coal to, say, wind turbines, especially when the coal lobby continues to hold so much sway in Washington. The more cheap natural gas that's available, the fewer coal-powered power plants--which cause 75 percent of the CO2 created by American energy generation--we'll need. Ban fracking, the theory goes, and we're more likely to turn right back to coal for now and not to solar panels.As for potential pollution from fracking, better regulation and standardization could address it as the EPA said, although skeptics will argue that an increasingly powerful gas industry would be just as capable of pushing back against regulation as today's coal industry is. Still, theorists like Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, present well thought-out arguments in favor of natural gas--including fracking--as an inexpensive and politically tolerable bridge to the future. Burning any fossil fuel is bad, but gas is the lesser evil, the theory goes, and we should look for ways to deal with it...at least for the immediate future.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed.Don Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites."}, {"title": "Surgeon General: Every Community Needs to Be Walkable", "text": "At a press conference to launch a new campaign for walkable communities, the U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said only half of Americans get enough physical activity to reduce their risk of heart disease and diabetes. Adults need 22 minutes of moderate activity each day, or about 150 minutes a week, at a minimum. But as mainstream health researchers and medical professionals are now realizing, half of the U.S. population may not be walking because they live in communities that actually physically prevent them from doing this. Over 30 percent of American communities can be considered unwalkable. And in these places, walking is not only a hassle -- given it requires people to actually drive or take a bus to where they can get out and walk around -- but it can also be dangerous. In 2013 alone, 4,700 pedestrians lost their lives due to collisions with cars, and since 2003, nearly 50,000 have.Murthy explained that Americans have \"lost the culture of physical activity.\" This has led to a health crisis. Indeed, according to the National Institute of Health, two-thirds of Americans are now considered overweight, with one-third considered obese. About 5 percent of the population is considered morbidly obese. But for Murthy, this cultural shift away from physical activity is directly connected with the growing dearth of walkable places. And it's particularly bad for seniors, people of color, and people with disabilities, who disproportionately live in unwalkable areas. \"That's a health equity issue, too.\"Furthermore, 7 out of 10 Americans die from preventable chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer, obesity, and heart disease. He added, \"it turns out the most powerful way we can turn the tide on chronic disease is something we have been doing for millennia: That is walking.\" He pointed to the public health department of a community in Indian River, Florida, that undertook an audit of the community's streets and then completely revamped them to become walkable, complete streets. \"95 percent of residents now spend time walking outside.\"And it's not just about walking, but also rolling. Murthy called for all communities to be fully wheelchair accessible. As the wheelchair-bound Maryland state official Juliette Rizzo explained, \"50 percent of Americans with disabilities don't get enough exercise. And adults with disabilities are three times as likely to have chronic diseases.\" For Rizzo, there are not many places where she can go exercise, and these kinds of gyms are expensive. \"But rocking and rolling are always affordable.\" Rizzo disabused people of the notion that people just sitting in their wheelchairs aren't exercising as well. As she navigates a path, she herself is moving and shifting her body, pumping her arms.Others lent their support at the press conference: Tyler Norris with Kaiser Permanente, a major healthcare provider, said their doctors now \"prescribe walking.\" He urged communities to leverage both public and private investments to create the infrastructure needed for walking and wheelchair rolling. Norris added that \"walking is a right, not a privilege or luxury. All must be able to walk in their communities, and that means all.\"Carlos Monje, assistant secretary for transportation policy with the U.S. Department of Transportation, said the Highway Administration has created \"more flexible\" mobility standards that will enable local communities to better fund their sidewalk improvement projects. He said the U.S. Congress is still debating the massive surface transportation bill, with its important \"transportation alternatives\" programs, which is Congressional-speak for projects with sidewalks and bike lanes, and urged people to contact their representative to push for safer, more walkable streets.And Kathy Smith, CEO of America Walks, said over 500 organizations across the country are doing important bottom-up work to make communities more walkable, often with annual budgets of less than $10,000. And some of these organizations encourage specific segments of the population to walk more. One example is GirlTrek, which builds support for walking as a healing process among African American women and girls. As GirlTrek co-founder Vanessa Criglar stated at the event, \"African American girls in particular face barriers to walking.\"Murthy is following the lead of environmental health leader Dr. Richard Jackson, who has written many books and produced a PBS series to bring attention to the disconnect between public health goals and the built environment. It's just too bad that the organizers of this important event at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't invite any representatives from the wide ranging fields involved in planning, designing, and implementing a safe, healthy transportation system. While we certainly applaud Surgeon General Murthy's new campaign, the press conference featured many doctors, even representatives from the council of shopping malls, but not a single representative from the urban planning, development, landscape architecture, and transportation engineering fields, which will create the solutions so critically needed.We must build strong partnerships between the public health and medical communities on one side and the planning and design worlds on the other to make sure this nationwide shift back to walking gets planned, designed, and built."}, {"title": "California Gov. Jerry Brown Sends Ben Carson The Climate Evidence He Couldn't Find", "text": "Retired neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson received a flash drive on Thursday full of the evidence for climate change that he has apparently been looking for.California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) mailed Carson a copy of the synthesis report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), along with a letter asking Carson to utilize his \"considerable intelligence\" to review the material. The IPCC is the scientific body created by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization to provide regular assessments of the state of climate science for policymakers.Brown's letter came after Carson asked to see the science demonstrating climate change was caused by human activity during a visit to California earlier this week.\"I know there a lot of people who say 'overwhelming science,' but then when you ask them to show the overwhelming science, they never can show it,\" Carson told The San Francisco Chronicle. \"There is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are man-caused and not naturally caused.\"\"Gimme a break,\" Carson added.Brown said the flash drive contained the \"overwhelming science\" Carson wanted.\"These aren't just words.

My husband, Cameron, got Gus as a puppy several years prior to our meeting and hadn't had the heart to discipline him much. When Cameron first brought Gus home he let the puppy sleep in bed with him curled up on his chest until one night Cameron awoke to Gus happily taking a dump there.After that Gus was crate trained, but that was pretty much the extent of his training. By the time I was in the picture Gus was sleeping in the bed again, although he had thankfully learned to poop elsewhere. I actually had to fight Gus for space on the bed at first.My general dislike for the mongrel wasn't changing towards admiration. Especially since he tended to try to dart out the front door and run away as often as possible, causing me or my husband to chase after him. He was still intact then and constantly on the prowl for bitches. Trying to corral his energy to walks proved disastrous. Gus nearly pulled me down the street. He also constantly jumped up on me and peed with reckless disregard for furniture and feet alike. I assumed that Gus was just something I would have to deal with because my husband (then boyfriend) loved him.Then one day I got a frantic call from Cameron at work. We were just dating, but I had already moved in. He was out of town on a training mission. Our roommate had taken Gus for a walk that morning. Gus had broken free of his collar and ran straight into the path of a minivan.Cameron was gone, and I had to do something. I was 25 and broke, but I didn't hesitate to put down a $500 deposit so that the vet could get to work. It was tense waiting to hear if he would be alright.He almost lost a leg. It still bears the scars and he limps in the cold. Thankfully, the rest of him was undamaged, and today only the scars give proof that he was ever injured.Before I took him home that day I bought him a new dog bed and special treats. It cost me another $100, but I wanted him to be comfortable. I couldn't let him up on the people bed where he usually slept, because if he tried to jump down he'd hurt himself even worse. I got the largest, plushest bed I could find and set it up in the bedroom.Lying in his new dog bed on the floor next to me, he kept crying in pain, even though I'd given him all of the pain medicine I could. I got down next to him with a pillow and the comforter and cooed at him while gently stroking his fur to try to calm him down. It was the hardest night of my life.That night Gus became my dog too. He went from an unimaginable annoyance to my baby. There are more pictures of him on my phone now than anything else. I have many conversations with him, although his English skills are lacking. It's ok though; I've become a master of interpretation.When he goes swimming he makes little grunting noises that are his way of singing \"happy swimming, happy swimming!\" His barks indicate either fear or annoyance- sometimes both. His whimper after I've stopped scratching his back translates to: \"why did you stop petting me? Don't you love me so much that you want to be petting me and playing with me ALL THE TIME?\"I do love him. I love this dog so much that I'll pick up his poop with a plastic bag and let him lick my face even though I know he also loves to lick his butt.Gus became even more important to me when we did our first PCS to New England as a family. I went from working full-time to unemployed. I volunteered and started hobbies, but found that Gus was my constant companion. Cameron had to leave for various trips, including an 8-week stint in another state while I stayed home. Gus made me feel safe, even though he is afraid of almost everything including rain, stairs, small dogs, kitchen gadgets, vacuum cleaners, the ukulele and baths. His presence was enough to make me feel less lonesome during days at home or when my husband had to leave for extended periods.Now I know that when Cameron goes on deployment, Gus will be there to dutifully notify me with a howl whenever a leaf passes before a streetlamp at 3 in the morning. He's done it before, and while a bit startling, it's also a comfort I never knew I'd need. If I lived near family or had a husband whose job didn't require him to leave for months at a time, it might be different. But as it stands this goofy pup is the glue that keeps it all working, and I love him for it."}, {"title": "Why We Are Inviting Walter Palmer Into Our Lions' Protected Area", "text": "Over two decades of campaigning for lions' protection, I've seen the battle get worse and worse. Not only for lions, but for us.Cecil's brutal slaying is blowing the lid off a much bigger lion crisis known as Canned Lion Hunting -- a shadowy sub-industry in which baby cubs are offered to tourists to pet for a price, then put into cages to be shot by international trophy hunters when they are adults. This means that South Africa's thriving tourism industry is directly linked to the killing industry. The cub you cuddle today will probably end up as a tame lion for the likes of Walter Palmer, or worse, to shoot for fun.If that is not bad enough, here are three facts you should know:Now that the horrendous truth is finally being exposed, it's time to shift gears and reach out across the battle lines.Walter Palmer has been holed up in an undisclosed destination while the death-threats pile up against the doors of his closed dental practice. Understandably, the people of the world are outraged by his brazen brutality in causing the death of Cecil, Zimbabwe's beloved black-maned lion.Why then, on August 10, 2015 -- World Lion Day -- did I reach out to Walter Palmer and invite the world's most wanted man to come out to join our team's efforts in protecting Africa's lions?\"The killing has to stop. This is a real offer,\" I told him. And I meant it.As a long-standing conservation organization, we are taking a great risk, but it's a leadership position that could change the stakes for lions and ecosystems.After committing my life to this battle for decades, it's deeply encouraging to see that the tragic death of one noble lion is resulting in global unification on an unprecedented scale behind one single united cause.So why be caught up in the hysteria of the Cecil tsunami, when there are so many other worthy causes?Because what happens to lions directly affects us all.Lions speak to our hearts. They inspire us to restore values of courage, love and truth in our lives, and they demand that we restore this kind of leadership in our world.This is precisely the kind of leadership we are witnessing amongst people and even corporate entities. The world's airlines united behind the same cause of protecting endangered species by refusing to carry trophies and animal parts as cargo. A lion-hearted thank you, and congratulations on taking an ethical stand. Don't we just love their joint statement: \"It's a long way to swim from Africa with your trophies.\" Now it's up to us lion-hearted people of the world to support their position through booking only on principled airlines. This leaves South African Airways out in the cold, still brazenly carrying trophies and animal parts as cargo.But lions don't only inspire true leadership, they play an absolutely fundamental role in protecting ecosystems, while ecosystems support all life on this planet, including our own survival.In nature, the apex animal keeps the entire balance all the way down through the prey species, plants, water and soil. It's called 'trophic cascading.' If ecosystems collapse, our systems will also collapse.So, we need to ensure our human systems and legislation support these all-important ecosystems.If we rise to the challenge, the tragedy around this one lion will help reform our policies for Lions, Land and People.As the king, lions are the most trophy hunted animal on earth. So, we urgently have to put laws in place to protect them, which will set a positive precedent that will protect all endangered species. Especially, given that the United States is responsible for as much as 60% of the trophies leaving Africa. But then the EU is responsible for as much as 30%. So, no one is really off the hook.Amidst the backlash of commercial interests in the massive trophy industry, which keeps throwing weak money arguments at us at the expense of our earth's survival, it is critical we stay strong and demand that politicians follow through on their public statements.To ensure that the plight of endangered species is also high on the United Kingdom's government agenda, my organization, the Global White Lion Protection Trust, has helped initiate a new All-Party Parliamentary Group of MPs in Britain, which highlights the need for more to be done to ensure wildlife is protected.Similarly, it's greatly encouraging news that four Democratic U.S. senators announced they intend to introduce a bill named after the beloved Zimbabwean lion: The Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large (CECIL) Animal Trophies Act. Note: The \"Large\" refers to the notorious \"Big 5,\" the most targeted species on the trophy hunter's hit-list of which we've said Lions, and unfortunately the White Lions, are number 1.Walter Palmer: Put down your weapons and come join the winning side, so that we all can see a positive way forward.Lions and nature are on our side."}, {"title": "Typhoon Rips Roof Off Island's Only Animal Shelter, Doesn't Stop Volunteers", "text": "It's been a little over a month since a devastating typhoon wrecked the island of Saipan, knocking out power and water, washing out roads and blowing off half the roof of the sole animal shelter.\"The shelter sustained major damage and will need a new roof,\" Jason Hudy, an organizer for the group Saipan Cares for Animals (as well as a professional magician) said. \"Before the typhoon, things were going well.\"Saipan is the most populated island in the stunningly beautiful insular chain called the Northern Mariana Islands, located in Micronesia.The NMI is a U.S. territory, but the infrastructure isn't robust. Weeks after the typhoon, more than half of the island is still without power. Water is still being rationed.And the animal shelter's roof hasn't yet been repaired.But volunteers are still doing their best to care for the island's homeless dogs and cats.\"I have been dedicating my time and energy in to helping our people, but that does not mean I cannot spend time in helping our animals as well,\" Ed Propst, a member of the NMI legislature and animal advocate, told The Huffington Post. \"We are great at multi-tasking and can help our people while also helping our animals in need. One need should not cancel out the other.\"This enthusiasm for and commitment to the island's cats and dogs is as recent as it is inspiring.Even now, for example, there is no law barring animal cruelty in the Northern Mariana Islands. Propst introduced such a bill in the spring, after a shocking video of a dog being beaten to death emerged -- and folks were horrified that there was no law under which the killers could be charged. That bill, the Animal Protection Act of 2015, is now, making its way through the legislative process.The Saipan shelter, too, used to be a different sort of animal. It's been in existence for half a decade now. Up until this spring, though, its main service was euthanasia.That changed in May, when Humane Society International -- in partnership with the Saipan Mayor's Office and the nonprofit Animal Balance -- held its first veterinary clinic, to sterilize and vaccinate the first few hundred of an estimated 21,000 stray dogs on the island.Saipan residents helped out with the clinic, \"and when the campaign finished the volunteers decided we couldn't let the momentum from the clinic end, so we began Saipan Cares for Animals,\" said Hudy.More than 100 volunteers have come to help out, since May. School groups have also paid visits. They've cleaned cages, walked dogs, and donated food.A network of foster homes is also developing, ready to give a temporary refuge to the island's many homeless pets -- an especially acute need since the typhoon.\"The volunteer group comes and helps in any way we can,\" said Hudy.And in the process, this bare-bones, 40-cage shelter has transformed from a terminal place, to somewhere that animals can get a second chance.\"Many of the dogs are leaving the shelter for homes,\" said Kelly Coladarci, with Humane Society International, which continues to provide programmatic and other support to the island's shelter and animals.Coladarci says more than 50 dogs have been adopted out of the shelter in the past half-year. (The shelter isn't yet equipped to keep cats, though some kitties have been placed in foster homes and adopted.)The hope is that the stray population shrinks due to increased sterilizations, while the number of animals adopted, and community engagement, continues to grow and grow.\"In general, we've worked to improve the quality of animals on the island,\" said Hudy, who expects a year from how, even more volunteers will be coming by -- roof or not -- to help out.He'd like to see pet adoption from the local shelter becoming the regular way that Saipan residents get their furry companions, before too long.Five years from now, he's wanting even more, like a permanent low-cost veterinary clinic on the island, and education and outreach to improve pets' quality of care.And for the shelter to have become established enough to keep going, even if there's another typhoon, and even if he himself has left to practice his magic elsewhere in the world.But now, Hudy is looking into the sky. And wishing he weren't able to see it. He's hoping that soon Saipan Cares for Animals will have the resources to save even more of the island's cats and dogs -- and repair that typhoon-wrecked roof.You can support Humane Society International's efforts here.Follow Saipan Cares for Animals on the group's Facebook page.

Do you want attention?\" I found this question so appalling I've decided to answer this question publicly, and in doing so will leave nameless the open mouth-breather who asked it -- just as a one-time courtesy.   Doing \"what I do for pits\" for the past seven years has lost me many friends and gained me countless enemies. I've been verbally attacked and have received death threats. I've had to serve cease-and-desist orders. I'm constantly criticized for what I say and how I say it by people, both in and outside of the animal community. I've been ambushed on live radio shows by so-called \"dog experts\" and pit bull hate groups (yes, they actually exist). I'm constantly asked and expected to \"do more\" by self-proclaimed \"advocates\" who, do nothing more than sit on their couch eating Doritos while posting from their computers.   The last TV show I was on, a writer approached in front of the entire cast and crew at the after-show party and said loudly, \"I don't like those pit bulls you stick up for. They're loaded guns. And my neighbors have a pit bull and I don't like them either!\" He continued to express his disdain (about dogs he clearly knows nothing about) at me to the uncomfortable point that people had to walk away. I ended up talking to him for an hour as he drank his beer and then got in his car to drive home, which ironically made him the loaded gun, and statistically far more dangerous to human lives than any dog of any kind could ever be. The last manager I met with told me \"You need to do one or the other. Either do your foundation stuff or your career,\" then passed on representing me.These are just some of examples of the kind of \"attention\" I get for standing up and speaking my mind.   I will never choose between my career (my passion) or my foundation (my purpose), and for someone to suggest I do is totally senseless. My career helps facilitate my foundation, which has saved (and continues to save) countless lives. The SUFP Foundation exists because an Angel came into my life and literally taught me how to do something bigger with the 24 years I've invested in what is one the most fair weather businesses on earth. As a result, what I do professionally and personally now has purpose. I planned a march on Washington DC while being a series regular on a sitcom all while writing, performing stand-up, producing live charity events around the country, taking care of my life, my Angel and running a foundation. I have donated every minute I've put into educating, advocating and saving the lives of pit bull-type dogs because I believe in protecting the innocent, voiceless souls who are being tortured, neglected, fought, killed and wrongfully vilified by ignorant and dangerous human beings.   So... to be very clear, I don't \"want attention.\" What I want is for my species to stop killing inherently good beings who cannot defend themselves. What I want is for parents to be better at being parents and teach their children to respect animals. What I want is for people in a first-world country with endless resources to get off their lazy asses and participate in making our communities safer for humans and pets and understand that animal abuse is a social issue that affects us all. What I want is for the federal government to step in and abolish BSL once and for all and stop using millions of taxpayers' dollars to enforce ineffective and discriminatory bullshit laws. What I want is for people to be responsible and stop buying dogs from breeders when millions are dying in shelters. And I want people to spay and neuter their fucking pets. The list goes on and on, but the result is always the same... to save lives and make communities safer for humans and pets.  I don't do this to make friends, for approval or a pat on the back. You don't like me? I don't care. You don't like dogs? I don't care. You don't think an \"advocate\" should use swear words? I don't give a shit. You don't want to get involved? Then please do not be shocked if someone you love is assaulted, robbed, raped or murdered by a troubled individual who first abused animals and no one did anything about it.   I do this to save dogs, and if this notion is unfathomable or difficult to understand, then I suggest you take a good long look at yourself in the mirror, dig deep into your broken soul and ask yourself if it's you and your lack of self worth who, in fact, seeks and needs attention and then try to do better at life.

In doing so, the owners let the reptilian \"genie out of the bottle\" and into the Everglades where the creatures quickly multiplied and overran the ecosystem.Non-native to Florida, the pythons have no natural enemies to put a crimp in their prodigious reproductive rate (females can carry as many as a 100 eggs at a time). In fact, the snakes proliferate so rapidly that they have overwhelmed authorities' belated efforts to avert the population explosion. Human beings have essentially been rendered helpless by the snake's fecundity. All attempts to remove the snakes from world-famous Everglades National Park (including bounty hunts and promotions to market the creatures as a source of food and decorative skins) have failed. Only several thousand pythons -which can grow to 18 feet in length--have been removed from the region, which is estimated to hold at least 150,000 of the reptiles. The ecological consequences have been devastating. Pythons are voracious eaters, decimating the deer, rabbits, birds and other wildlife native to the Everglades, and thus setting the stage for an ecological wasteland.How could nature check the python population explosion where man cannot? Nature has a way of regulating population imbalances between predators and prey. As prey become scarcer, predator populations tend to contract in correlation because of a lack of food sources. An equilibrium is established through a Darwinian natural selection process in which only the fittest of the hunters and hunted survive.A problem arises if the prey have been reduced to such low levels that there are not enough left to regenerate a sustainable recovery, even if predator ranks thin. In that case, both the native wildlife and most of the python population could eventually be doomed, with the niche filled by who knows what.Nature also has other ways of checking population imbalances. Climate can be a limiting factor as numerous pythons in the past have perished in a cold snap. That ordinarily would dictate against a mass northward migration of the snakes into Georgia and the Carolinas. But global warming might remove that barrier.Another way nature has trimmed predators' ranks is to introduce a parasite or virus that is lethal only to the target species. (This might even be a way mankind could exert some control if scientists in the lab could develop some micro-organism fatal exclusively to the pythons).Over time, depleted prey can often acquire skills to make them harder marks for their enemies, but will enough survivors be left to reconstitute a viable population?These are the dangers--often unintended consequences--of human beings unleashing invasive species into the environment."}, {"title": "Harrowing Photos Document Devastation After Rains Hit Japan", "text": "A series of rare torrential rains burst the banks of two rivers in eastern Japan on Thursday and Friday, causing flooding and landslides that forced 100,000 people to evacuate, and left three dead and 23 missing.Among the three people who died was a 63-year-old woman whose house was crushed by a landslide in Kanuma city.More than 3,500 people in the city of Joso spent Thursday night in makeshift evacuation centers in schools, community centers and the city hall, where they were given hot food and sleeping bags.\"The government will work as one to prioritize the safety of the people and do our best to prevent any further disaster,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Thursday.The Japanese government has sent 5,800 police, military and emergency forces to the regions surrounding the Kinugawa river in Joso, Ibaraki prefecture, and the Shibuigawa river in Miyagi prefecture.The harrowing photos below document how the floods have devastated cities and homes, and how authorities are stepping in to help:"}, {"title": "President Trump and Sec. Palin Vs People of Faith on Care of Creation", "text": "Sarah Palin wants a cabinet position in any future Donald Trump administration. Specifically, she'd like to be secretary of the Department of Energy. The former half-term Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice-presidential candidate said this week:I think a lot about the Department of Energy, because energy is my baby, oil and gas and minerals, those things that God has dumped on this part of the earth for mankind's use instead of us relying on unfriendly foreign nations, for us to import their ... resources.Palin has long argued that the world's resources are a gift from God to be plundered. Climate change? Palin doesn't believe that humans could impact the climate. When world leaders gathered in Copenhagen in December 2009 to discuss ways to better protect the environment Palin famously tweeted:This puts Palin at odds with the scientific community, Pope Francis, the World Council of Churches, the World Jewish Congress, the National Association of Evangelicals in the United States, and Islamic scholars across the globe. All argue that humanity has a role - no, an obligation - to protect the environment and to do everything possible to reverse the impact of human caused climate change.Pope Francis recently wrote:We are not God. The earth was here before us and it has been given to us. This allows us to respond to the charge that Judaeo-Christian thinking, on the basis of the Genesis account which grants man 'dominion' over the earth (cf. Gen 1:28), has encouraged the unbridled exploitation of nature by painting him as domineering and destructive by nature. This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church. Although it is true that we Christians have at times incorrectly interpreted the Scriptures, nowadays we must forcefully reject the notion that our being created in God's image and given dominion over the earth justifies absolute domination over other creatures. The biblical texts are to be read in their context, with an appropriate hermeneutic, recognizing that they tell us to 'till and keep' the garden of the world (cf. Gen 2:15). 'Tilling' refers to cultivating, ploughing or working, while 'keeping' means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving. This implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between human beings and nature.Palin's views on the environment might not be in line with the thinking of world religious leaders but she does share a common philosophy with Donald Trump and nearly all the GOP contenders for president. Trump believes that climate change is a hoax.People of faith, regardless of politics, need to be at the forefront of a world-wide movement that makes action on climate change not just politically possible but political suicide for those who would oppose such action. This is not about partisanship or party. We can and should applaud President Obama's overall climate change proposals, which move us in the right direction, but oppose President Obama when he takes such counter productive steps as allowing drilling for oil in the Arctic Ocean. Too many Democrats are timid on this issue while too many Republicans deny there is an issue to be concerned about.We fail God if we do not respond to the crisis of climate change. After all, we created this crisis. The gift of creation is at stake. We leave for those who are younger a world in peril that will only become more dangerous and fractured over time without corrective action. All the people of the Earth have a responsibility to be - to borrow a term from the Hebrew Scriptures - restorers of the breach.God did not \"dump\" the wonders of this planet on us to be exploited.People of faith have a special responsibility here because we are charged by God to be stewards of creation and thus far we have failed to live out our responsibilities. Our sins will most certainly be visited on our children and their children. Still, action taken now to repent of those sins by doing whatever is necessary to restore the earth to the balance which God created would be a gift for future generations that would prove our worth as a species.As for Palin:I think a lot about the Department of Energy. And if I were head of that, I'd get rid of it. And I'd let the states start having more control over the lands that are within their boundaries and the people who are affected by the developments within their states.No one with her philosophy should be allowed during these times to hold public office.

But the mysterious deaths have shaken the island community.“One day,” Lihue resident Joseph Manini Jr. told the Kauai newspaper, \"I saw one fall right out of a tree.\"The Garden Island reported that dead chickens were being shoveled into a state conservation department truck and have been shipped to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's office on Oahu for testing to determine the cause of death.Earlier this year, Kauai's famous feathered creatures drew national attention as the subject of a New York Times article.“They’re absolutely everywhere,” Eben J.

Even more so when it insists on continuing to do the the very things that will destroy their homes - dig up, sell and burn more fossil fuels. And then rubs salt in the wounds by joking about sea level rise inundating its Islands.This has been one of the crueler weeks in the Australian Government's ongoing negligence on the greatest moral challenge of our time. Ahead of the Paris climate talks in December, Pacific Leaders this week converged in Port Moresby to progress a plan to keep their Islands above sea level.But the elephant in the room is that the elephant was not in the room. Countries like mine that have contributed to this tragic situation were, for the large part, nowhere to be seen. And when they were, it was to defend their supposed right to drag their heels on climate action and to dig up and burn more coalThe contrast between the inaction of countries like Australia and the reality of climate impacts in the Pacific couldn't be starker. The decisions that our Government makes are already having damaging consequences for our brothers and sisters in Kiribati, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, whose cultures and livelihoods are increasingly threatened by climate-fueled extreme weather events and sea level rise.For the Pacific - climate change is not academic, it's not political and it's not economic. It's a question of survival.Australia is one of the sunniest and windiest countries on the planet. Rather than tapping into this endless energy source we instead choose to dig huge holes in the ground so that we can burn black rocks and export pollution and misery to the world. It doesn't have to be this way. It is this way because our elected leaders are beholden to big coal and gas interests. But we can and must change this and we must do it soon.The Pacific is doing everything it can to avoid the unjust fate that countries like ours are imposing upon it. Islands like Samoa and Tokelau have set 100% renewable energy targets. Tokelau is already 94% of the way there. The College of the Marshall Islands last year committed to divest from fossil fuels. Last month, Kiribati President Anote Tong urged world leaders to back a global moratorium on new coal mines, so that countries like his could have a future.But for all the Island's admirable efforts, they cannot turn the climate change ship around without our support. This is not an injustice of their making. It's an injustice that countries like Australia must take responsibility for. This is about morality and it's about survival.That this situation is playing out just a stone's throw from our shores makes Australia's plans to plow billions of taxpayer money into one of the world's largest coal projects - the Galilee Basin - unconscionable. It makes proposals to develop massive new coal mines and gas wells, on our best farming land, look preposterous, as our neighbors' face inundation from a warming climate. It shows up drilling the Great Australian Bight for oil and gas and fracking WA's Kimberley for what these projects really are - not nation builders or job creators but guarantors of inordinate human suffering.The good news is that the worst of this suffering can be avoided, but only if we act now. Pacific leaders have issued a call for us to say no to new coal mines and to set emission reduction targets which keep global warming to 1.5 degrees. Whilst our Government chooses to ignore these calls, we can choose otherwise. As Small Island States discussed their survival in Port Moresby this week, a group of Australians staged a solidarity walk-on to the world's largest coal port in Newcastle. They were not alone. Just two weeks prior, the city of Newcastle committed to move their investments away from fossil fuels. Some 40 institutions in Australia have committed to divest from fossil fuels, joining 400 worldwide.Australians are increasingly stepping up to say no to our Government's reckless fossil fuel expansion plans and the undoing of the renewable energy sector. Last year, hundreds of people joined with our Pacific neighbors to stop coal ships leaving Newcastle's port. Earlier this year, dozens of us walked on to the gateway to Australia's largest new coal project in the Galilee Basin. Around the country and across the world, people are standing up to keep fossil fuels in the ground and to fight for climate justice. Just as we won't tolerate coal mines and gas wells in our own backyards, we won't stand idly by and let our leaders export misery to our closest neighbors.Australia's federal election is looming.

In short, the likelihood of very large impacts is greater than we would expect under typical statistical assumptions.We are used to thinking about likelihoods and probabilities in terms of the familiar \"normal\" distribution -- otherwise known as the \"bell curve\". It looks like this:The normal distribution (Source: MIT News).Roughly 68 percent of the area falls within the region bounded by 1 standard deviation below (-1 sigma) and above (+1 sigma) the \"mean\" or \"average\", and a substantially greater 96% of the area falls between two standard deviations below (-2 sigma) and above (+2 sigma) the mean. So given this statistical distribution, we would expect values to fall above the +2 sigma (two standard deviation) limit only about 2 percent of the time. Call that the positive \"tail\" of the distribution.There are many phenomena that follow a normal distribution, from the heights of adult men in the U.S. to the day-to-day fluctuations in summer temperature in New York City. But the predicted warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations isn't one of them.Global warming instead displays what we call a \"heavy-tailed\" or \"fat-tailed\" distribution. There is more area under the far right extreme of the curve than we would expect for a normal distribution, a greater likelihood of warming that is well in excess of the average amount of warming predicted by climate models.An important new book Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet by Environmental Defense Fund senior economist Gernot Wagner and Harvard economist Martin Weitzman, explores the deep implications this has for the debate over climate policy.Here's the blurb I wrote for the book (a shortened version of which appears on the back cover):Think climate change is a low-priority problem? Something to put off while we deal with more immediate threats? Then Climate Shock will open your eyes. Leading economists Wagner and Weitzman explain, in simple, understandable terms, why we face an existential threat in human-caused climate change. The authors lay out the case for taking out a planetary insurance policy, without delay, in the form of market mechanisms aimed at keeping carbon emissions below dangerous levels.The \"insurance policy\" analogy is appropriate here. We don't purchase fire insurance on our homes because our homes are likely to burn down. Far from it in fact: less than one-in-four homeowners are likely to ever experience a house fire. We purchase fire insurance because we understand that, even though such a catastrophic event is unlikely (less than 25 percent chance of happening), if it did happen, it would be catastrophic. So it is worth hedging against, by investing money now -- in the form of fire insurance.Let us consider, in that context, the prospects for warming well in excess of what we might term \"dangerous\" (typically considered to be at least 2C or 3.6F warming of the planet). How likely, for example, are we to experience a catastrophic 6C = 11F warming of the globe, if we allow greenhouse gas concentrations to reach double their pre-industrial levels (something we're on course to do by the middle of this century given business-as-usual burning of fossil fuels)?Well, the mean or average warming that is predicted by models in that scenario is about 3C, and the standard deviation about 1.5C. So the positive tail, defined as the +2 sigma limit, is about 6C of warming. As shown by Wagner & Weitzman (see figure below), the likelihood of exceeding that amount of warming isn't 2% as we would expect for a bell-curve distribution. It's closer to 10%!An estimate of the likelihood of warming due to a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations (Source: Wagner & Weitzman \"Climate Shock\" (via NPR)).In fact, it's actually even worse than that when we consider the associated risk. Risk is defined as the product of the likelihood and consequence of an outcome. We just saw that the likelihood of warming is described by a heavy-tailed distribution, with a higher likelihood of far-greater-than-average amounts of warming than we would expect given typical statistical assumptions. This is further compounded by the fact that the damages caused by climate change -- i.e. the consequence -- also increases dramatically with warming. That further increases the associated risk.With additional warming comes the increased likelihood that we exceed certain \"tipping points\", like the melting of large parts of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet and the associated massive rise in sea level that would produce. Recent research suggests we may now have warmed the planet enough to insure at least 10 feet of sea level rise if not more. Some models suggest that that will take multiple centuries to happen. But maybe it will happen faster than the models predict.Indeed, we have historically tended to underestimate the rate of climate change impacts. We reviewed the evidence in Dire Predictions: Understanding Climate Change, showing that many aspects of climate change -- e.g. the melting of Arctic sea ice and the ice sheets, and the rise in sea level -- have proceeded faster than the models had predicted on average. Uncertainty is not our friend when it comes to the prospects for dangerous climate change.So we have to ask ourselves, do we feel lucky? If not, than we would perhaps be wise to purchase a planetary insurance policy in the form of policies to dramatically reduce our collective carbon emissions.A recent article in Esquire by John H. Richardson explored the way various climate scientists (including myself) grapple with the complicated and indeed sometimes emotional task of communicating knowledge, uncertainty, and risk in a way that best informs the contentious debate over human-caused climate change and what to do about it.OK. So now imagine my disappointment upon coming across an article that purports to embrace the thesis of Climate Shock -- in particular, the threat of the \"fat tail\" -- but in fact misunderstands it entirely -- and misrepresents, for good measure, the Esquire article and the scientists quoted in it -- including me.The piece in question appeared at the tech-oriented website Quartz, authored by Allison Schrager, a self-described \"economist, writer, and pension geek\" with an interest in \"how to hedge risk.\" The very title of the piece itself \"Climate scientists undermine their own science by avoiding the best case scenario\" is a falsehood, foreboding a fundamental misunderstanding of all of the principles explained thus far in this article.In fairness, Schrager gets some things right. For example, she is correct when she states that:[Wagner and Weitzman] use finance theory to argue the presence of risk is precisely why we need to limit carbon emissions sooner rather than later. In finance, risk poses a cost. You can pay to reduce it and often, the sooner you do, the cheaper it is to deal with the risk.And she relevantly quotes Wagner on the the threat of the \"heavy tail\":Wagner estimates there's a 10% chance of a catastrophic outcome. \"That may be unlikely, but it's a huge freakin' problem,\" he told Quartz.But it all then goes awry. In what has sadly become an all-too familiar pattern of blaming the scientists (yes -- this mess we've gotten ourselves into is all the fault of the scientists!), Schrager levels a number of cheap shots against climate researchers.She accuses climate scientists, for example, of using \"more forceful language\" (horrors!) and of seeking to \"underplay the uncertainty that still exists\" (without even an iota of evidence to support that contention).Then, in what frankly smacks of concern trolling, expresses her deep distress about what is \"at stake\":Considering what's at stake, the extreme measures and playing up the stark predictions are understandable. But exaggerating the likelihood of extreme outcomes not only give deniers ammunition, it undermines convincing--even if not entirely certain--science.Yes, those climate scientists are \"exaggerating extreme outcomes\" -- and that's what is fueling climate change denialism (something I happen to know a thing or two about) and undermining science!OK -- and the evidence for this laundry list of accusations against climate researchers? A single quote mine of the Esquire piece. And the minee? Yes indeed -- your's truly.Seeking to provide an example of how \"climate scientists feel a need to go so extreme\" she quotes the following passage in the Esquire article involving me:As Mann sees it, scientists like [NASA/GISS scientist Gavin] Schmidt who choose to focus on the middle of the curve aren't really being scientific. Worse are pseudo-sympathizers like Bjorn Lomborg who always focus on the gentlest possibilities. Because we're supposed to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, and a real scientific response would also give serious weight to the dark side of the curve.I've added the emphasis, because Schrager appears to have missed the words \"focus\" and \"also\" which are absolutely critical to a meaningful reading of that passage. The point being made there is that we shouldn't only consider the central tendencies (the mean). We need to ALSO consider the worst-case scenarios -- the FAT TAIL, to fully assess the associated risk. It is what Climate Shock is literally all about.But Schrager continues with the straw man that she's constructed:As a pension economist I understand the temptation to over-emphasize the worst case.No. Let's be clear about this. Nobody here is arguing to \"over-emphasize the worst case\". Not me. Not anyone quoted in the Esquire article. All we're arguing is to not neglect the fat tail.The straw man continues to the very end of the article, with Schrager concluding:It's tempting to shout from the rooftops that this is a disaster waiting to happen, because the downside is so scary -- even if it will only impact our grandchildren. More so for climate change where the stakes are so much bigger. But that only gives skeptics room to question climate scientists' findings. If anything, the existence of uncertainty provides the best case for swift action because the solutions (cap-and-trade, investment in renewables) are relatively cheap compared to what they will be in the future if worst cases are realized.Which means that she apparently didn't really get anything out of Climate Shock at all.The actual reason uncertainty provides the \"best case for swift action\", as explained in excruciating detail in Climate Shock, is the FAT TAIL of risk emphasized by Wagner and Weitzman (and by me in the Esquire piece). The best reason for taking out a planetary insurance policy is the non-negligible likelihood of climate changes that are considerably greater, and risks that are more severe, that our average current predictions. That, in a sentence, is the thesis of Climate Shock.There is need for a nuanced discussion of climate risk and solutions, and the challenges inherent in decision making in the face of uncertainty -- things I always stress in my commentaries and public speaking engagements about climate change.But straw man constructions that caricature these nuanced matters and misrepresent the scientists and their efforts to inform this critical discussion, does absolutely nothing to advance that discussion. Indeed, it does quite a bit to harm it.As we head into the all-important UN summit in Paris this December, which is perhaps our last chance for an international treaty that will avert dangerous and irreversible climate change, it is time for serious people and serious discussions, not straw men and distractions. We simply can't risk that.__________Michael Mann is Distinguished Professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University and author of The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines and the recently updated and expanded Dire Predictions: Understanding Climate Change."}, {"title": "Last Rescue Dog From Ground Zero Gets A Day To Remember In NYC", "text": "Every year, when the anniversary of 9/11 approaches, I like to take a quiet moment to reflect on the many heroes who saved so many lives on that dark day.

The goal of getting universities to divest isn't to financially burden fossil fuel companies; it's to tarnish their image.\"The idea was basically to shift cultural attitude,\" he said, noting that institutions that divested from Big Tobacco influenced the national perception of the industry. \"Americans see cigarette companies in this certain way that’s really negative. If you ask an average American for their opinion of Philip Morris, it's that they’re sort of merchants of death, that they’re lying about their products. We want folks to see fossil fuels the same way, because the business model isn’t fundamentally all that different.\"Academic institutions, Ganapathy said, have exceptional power to shift public opinion and influence lawmakers.\"The whole idea is basically to get the institutions that people trust -- Harvard, the University of California, Stanford -- to get folks to pull their money out of fossil fuels and take a stand against the industry,\" he said, \"the way that a lot of them did with tobacco, the way a lot of them did with apartheid-era South Africa. The idea is that it will shift cultural attitudes by getting big institutions that people trust to take a moral stand against.\"Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, agreed that while divestment announcements like this are \"political statements more than anything else,\" they can have an impact when coming from universities.\"The hope is that efforts such as these will do two things: make it harder for undesirable interests to do business, and serve as a role model for other funds that might not be as afraid to make similar statements,\" Gerston said. \"It's more symbolic than substantive, yet symbolism is important especially with entities such as academic institutions.\"While losing these investments might not make an immediate dent in the market value of fossil fuel companies, universities may find divesting to be expensive. A study funded by the petroleum industry claims that Harvard would lose $108 million per year in investment returns if it divested its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, according to The Crimson, the university's campus newspaper.But with another study pointing out that the U.S. coal industry has lost 76 percent of its value over the past five years, Greenpeace spokesman Joe Smyth says it makes financial sense to divest.\"There's a growing understanding that coal doesn't just threaten our health and our climate,\" he said. \"It's a bad bet for investors as well, as coal mining companies have lost most of their value in recent years ... So we should expect to see more divestment decisions from investors, especially those that are paying close attention to long-term trends.\"The University of California joins nearly 40 other universities and colleges around the world that have made similar commitments, including Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Washington, Syracuse, the University of Hawaii and Oxford. While UC will keep about $10 billion of its endowment in energy industry investments, Ganapathy nonetheless called Wednesday's decision \"hugely, hugely significant.\"\"It amps up pressure on decision-makers around the country,\" he said. \"If you’re the head of a college campus and you see the news that a $98.2 billion fund was just divested, the people holding onto the status quo are running out of excuses when things like this happen.”Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Evolution Will Change How You See the World", "text": "When the idea of evolution sinks in - really sinks in - evolution hits home with power and an emotional rush.I have attempted to convey in my writings that science and evolution, deeply felt, provide a dramatic and poetic rendering of what it is to be human.To go further, I made this video \"Evolution Will Change How You See The World.\"I hope you agree that its stirring blend of words and images entertain, provoke thought, and inspire awe."}, {"title": "SB 350 Threatens Petroleum Profits", "text": "Felonius Ax of the Billionaires for Petroleum Polluter Profits here to shine some much-needed light on a terrifying piece of legislation worming its way through the California legislature.

Jerry Brown is poised to sign it into law.Yes, the bill will make California air much more breathable, and it's certain to spur the development of technologies to harness renewable energy sources. And the reduction of carbon emissions that it calls for are bound to slow the effects of climate change down and serve for a model for other states to adopt. But as laudable as all these goals are, the bill is bound to devastate one small minority community - those of us who are executives in the petroleum industry. We are human beings too! And according to the US Supreme Court, so are the petrochemical corporations we represent. We have passions and dreams just like other Californians. One of our dreams is a California where every bit of oil under the Monterey Shale has been fracked by our companies and sold to the Chinese!That's why we've been running ads warning you that gas prices will rise astronomically if this bill should pass. How can we be so sure? Well, you know how the tyrants at the Air Resources Board require a cleaner burning summer fuel blend here than the rest of the states, and gas in California is so much more expensive than elsewhere? You think it's a coincidence that several California refineries are offline for maintenance or repairs at any given time? Witness our patently passive-aggressive penalty for having to manufacture cleaner gas and just imagine how punitive we're going to be if SB 350 should become law and California has to reduce its consumption of the very substance that is such a sweet source of our profits!SB 350 contains a 50-50-50 formula: 50 percent of California's energy from renewable sources by 2030, 50 percent greater energy efficiency in buildings, and a 50 percent reduction in petroleum use. This last one in particular rankles our refineries. So we have a 50-50-50 plan of our own: 50 percent fewer environmental laws regulating our industry, 50 percent less whining about greenhouse gases on the part of the tree-huggers who are pushing this legislation and finally, 50 percent more drilling and fracking all over California, including those coasts. Santa Barbara beaches get tainted by a little tar from the latest oil spill, and suddenly our business model is somehow negligent?!And we have a message to the \"moderate\" Democratic representatives who hold the fortunes of this bill in your cash hungry hands: Don't listen to the voices of the special interests - like these constituents of yours who want to breathe cleaner air and live in a planet that isn't getting steadily warmer! We didn't lavish all those generous campaign contributions on you because we liked your ideas or admired your principles. Some of you might be running for reelection next year, or for higher office, and petroleum industry donations can buy a lot of campaign mailers and ad time! You gotta dance with the one's who brung ya! And the music started when the Senate passed this distressing bill. So may we have this dance?SB 350 will be voted on in the Assembly this week. So Californians, it's time to get your priorities straight! Are you going to stand with the selfish mob that wants to breathe cleaner air, or are you going to dare to stand up for a small beleaguered minority of Billionaires with a lot of investments in Big Oil to protect our unique way of life?

He was terminally ill with kidney failure, and she had called upon me as a home-visit veterinarian to come to her house and help Max cross over peacefully and gently. \"I'm so sorry,\" she said as the pile of tissues grew into a tower. \"I wasn't even this upset when my husband died.\" She paused. \"He's the one who bought Max for me.\"The depth of her grief was shocking to her, as it is to so many of my clients. The death of an elderly pet is not unexpected. That's the deal with pets: They come, they worm their way into our hearts for a decade or so, and then they depart, taking a piece of our hearts with them. But why is it that a woman who calmly sat at her husband's hospice bed a year ago has come undone when her dog is dying?Pets are so much more than animals who slink around the house and make a mess, at least to those of us who enmesh them in our lives and consider them family members. They are companions, solace, and entertainment.And the more time I spend hearing families' personal stories, the more I see that each pet serves a unique purpose at a point in our lives, a task that defines their all-too-brief time on Earth. Oftentimes we don't even recognize that task until the moment has already passed.In April of this year, my mother was diagnosed with Grade IV glioblastoma, widely considered one of the most terrifying types of brain cancer one can have. As a nurse, she understood that even with treatment, the prognosis was grim, and she decided very soon after the diagnosis that she did not want to undergo daily radiation and chemotherapy.I had to rely on every bit of experience I had as a hospice veterinarian who gave people permission to say \"no\" to aggressive therapy for their pets to help my mother do the same thing. She knew her time was limited and had no interest in spending it staring at the fluorescent lights of a hospital room ceiling. She'd rather spend it on the patio, watching the hot air balloons drift by at sunset.When Mom was discharged from the hospital into hospice care, she and my father moved into my home so I could help with her care. My goofy Golden Retriever Brody was thrilled to have so much company, but I was apprehensive. Although he was five, he thought he was still a puppy, and had a bad habit of bowling enthusiastically into newcomers, wagging his entire caboose with such enthusiasm that the visitor's body would vibrate in time with his tail. Mom was wobbly due to her brain tumor, and I worried at the idea of him knocking her over.From the moment Mom and Dad arrived at the house, Brody changed. Sensing a change in the atmosphere, he attached himself to my parents, and when Dad gently held her hand to walk down the hall, Brody would glide up to her other side to prop her up. I barely saw him in the two months Mom remained with us, such was Brody's insistence on remaining by her side, resting his head on her lap while she patted him and said, \"What a good boy,\" in an increasingly faint voice.When hospice nurses arrived with medications, syringes, and other reminders of her impending death, he would curl up next to her on the couch while her foot tapped nervously on the floor, licking her until her toes slowed their anxious drumming.She died at sunrise on June 3, with Brody by her side.And that, I think, is why so many of us have trouble describing to others why we are so flattened when a pet dies. We mourn not only their loss, but the passage of time and the moment they represented. My lovely client was saying goodbye not only to Max but the last breathing reminder of her husband's love. When Brody dies someday long in the future, I know I will close my eyes and see Mom's tiny hand resting on his head, outstretched for the time we might someday meet again."}, {"title": "Sustainable 'Tree House' Could Come To A Parking Lot Near You", "text": "A company in Hawaii is elevating the conversation about tiny homes -- literally.A unique, tree-like structure called Elevate addresses some of the problems facing tiny houses, such as security and parking, while also offering solutions for sustainable living and small businesses.Plus, it's cool looking.Designed to blend in with nature's surroundings, Elevate was \"created with the vision of bringing a practical space that addresses global and environmental concerns,\" said Nathan Toothman, co-founder and CEO of Elevate, in a promotional video.Toothman and his wife, Tiffany, both engineers, originally saw the unit as an off-the-grid housing solution for Hawaii's remote areas.

It is so large that it contains more water than all of the North American Great Lakes combined. Baikal is estimated to be over 25 million years old and 5,387 feet deep. In 1996, UNESCO inscribed Lake Baikal into the World Heritage List, describing it as \"the most outstanding example of a freshwater ecosystem on the basis of natural criteria.\" Baikal hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals, and new species are discovered every year. 80 percent of the animals are endemic, found only in Lake Baikal.Yet Lake Baikal is under threat. In 2014, steady climate change caused Lake Baikal's main water supply source, the Selenga river to supply only half of the volume it normally does. This led Russia to declare a State of Emergency. By the end of May 2015, the water level in the lake dropped to its lowest levels in the last 100 years. A special inter-agency Group was established by the Russian government to address the crisis. At its first meeting in May, the group announced they could not put together a water management plan for Lake Baikal. They concluded that the problem, originally caused by climate change, might soon be exacerbated by impacts from hydro power development projects on rivers upstream in Mongolia.Mongolia's Dam(n) PlansMongolia has ambitious plans to develop dams along the Selenga river basin, including the nearly $830 million Egiin Gol hydro power plant, which it hopes to break ground on next year. At the government's request, the World Bank is funding an assessment of the economic and technical feasibility of two additional hydro power plants -- Shuren Hydro on the Selenga river's main channel, and a second on its major tributary, the Orkhon river. Civil society organizations are alarmed by the multiple social and ecological risks such projects pose in water-scarce Mongolia, where wind and solar energy resources are more abundant than hydro power. They are opposing the plans to further develop these projects.Photo caption: Selenga river at the site of Shuren Dam (Photo credits: Rivers without Boundaries)According to these groups, plans for massive hydropower development will result in irreversible environmental impacts on the Selenga river basin and Lake Baikal, and will also have significant socio-economic impacts on the communities who depend upon these resources. By disrupting the river flow, changing the natural seasonal cycles, reducing flow volumes in dry periods and blocking the flow of sediments, these dams will bring about degradation of critical habitats. These include river floodplains, the Selenga Delta Ramsar wetland and the Lake Baikal UNESCO World Heritage Site. Endemic species, such as the Baikal Sturgeon and the nerpa, listed under Bonn Convention, could go extinct. Local pastoral communities will be displaced from river valleys and traditional fishermen deprived of their catch.  Banks Competing to Have a Piece of CakeBank money is being used to enable dam projects with potentially irreversible damage to river Selenga and Lake Baikal. After many unsuccessful meetings with the Mongolian government and World Bank, Greenpeace Russia and the Rivers without Boundaries International Coalition (RwB) helped local citizens to file a complaint with the Inspection Panel of the World Bank to investigate the Bank's involvement in this destructive project. While the Panel agreed that Bank policies could be violated by harm resulting from future project-related activities, they deferred a decision to investigate further for a year.In August 2015, the RwB also addressed the involvement of the China Exim Bank, from which Mongolia hopes to secure USD 1 billion loan for construction of the Egiin-Gol Dam. RwB called on the Bank to postpone any decisions until a cumulative impact assessment is done for all planned dams and the well-being of Lake Baikal and local communities along the Selenga is safeguarded. Such requests have been met with silence.Photo caption: Orkhon river has little water to spare (Photo credits: Rivers without Boundaries)World Heritage Committee Alarms RingIn July 2015, the World Heritage Committee (WHC) met to discuss the impact of dams on Lake Baikal. This Committee issued a decision that calls on Mongolia to avoid approving any new dams until Environment Impact Assessments are carried out for all project-related activities. Additionally, WHC called for a robust cumulative impact assessment to be completed by the World Heritage Center and IUCN before deciding on new dams, and that Mongolia and Russia \"jointly develop a Strategic Environmental Assessment for any future hydro power and water management projects.\"Lake Baikal, as a World Heritage site, should be off limits to any economic activities that may negatively affect designated sites, even under the banners of \"development\" or \"carbon emission reductions.\" Development should not come at such a high cost to one of the world's rarest and most critical natural habitats.

Photograph by Brian Batista Photography)If you've ever had a conversation about pit bulls, then you've probably heard about pit bull bite statistics. Statistics that, at face value, may seem concerning. Statistics that have been used to affect public policy at times, labeling all dogs of a certain type as inherently vicious and dangerous upon birth.(Star, rescued by my organization at 3 months after being hand fed chewing tobacco as a home remedy for de-worming)The thing is, it's pretty easy to make up stats that support a predetermined conclusion. Self-proclaimed \"experts\" can manipulate numbers and then use like-minded colleagues to \"peer review\" their work, thus claiming authenticity and ultimately, attempting to influence public policy.It's a trick as old as organized government, itself. Create a bogeyman, and then legislate it away.\"There are three types of lies in this world. Lies, damn lies and statistics.\"-Mark TwainIn order to look at any issue objectively, you have to first define the terms and the parameters you're working with. You have to make sure you're comparing apples to apples and more importantly, that you even know what an apple is when you see one.A) What is a statistic?  B) What is a pit bull?  C) How are pit bulls identified?What is a statistic?: \"A calculated numerical value that characterizes some aspect of a sample set of data, and that is often meant to estimate the true value of a corresponding parameter in an underlying population.\"What is a Pit Bull?: It is commonly accepted that \"pit bull\" is not a breed but a loosely defined and general category. Definition of this category varies depending upon the source. Any blocky headed dog, or any mix of breeds that is between 35 and 100 pounds and upwards of 30 individual dog breeds may currently fall in this broad category through the use of visual breed identification.   See more about visual breed identification and how genetics affect behavior here.How are pit bulls identified?: Visual breed identification, or the extremely scientific (insert sarcasm) process of tilting your head 30 degrees to the right or left and guessing based on a few, basic traits and the inability to automatically identify the dog as something else, is how pit bulls are identified.\"Based upon the observation of a handful of variable breed-associated physical traits, such as coat color, body size, skull shape and whether the ears or erect or floppy. These physical traits are found in many different breeds and are controlled by approximately 50 of the roughly 20,000 genes that create a dog.\" - Read more about of the science behind canine behavior, here.We could stop, right at this point.   In order for a \"number\" to be a \"statistic,\" it has to estimate a true value of specific data. The data has to be definable, and the parameters have to be clear.\"Please note that I do NOT participate in the kennel club breed-name game. Where some 'breed' is in fact a mastiff-pit bull mix (such as the bull mastiff or the Cane Corso), I list it as a pit bull-type dog / pit mix...Please note that I'm counting deaths by pit bull / pit mix ATTACK, whether or not cars killed the targets before the pit bulls could 'bite' them to death. The two children who ran into traffic would have been alive today if pit bulls hadn't initiated an attack on them.\"--Merritt CliftonIf you aren't going to play the breed-name game to make the numbers up, then you can't use those same numbers to play the breed-blame game, either.But let's pretend that all validity wasn't thrown out the window just yet, where do these numbers come from, after all?Dog bite \"statistics\" are based off of media reports found online where pit bull type attacks are proven to be reported thousands of times more often than dog bite stories involving other breeds. Hardly a scientific, objective, or accurate way to collect information and in fact, there is a proven bias and over reporting when it comes to dogs labeled as pit bulls.This \"google-research\" is then taken and compared with media reports involving individual, specific dog breeds. Like, a Labrador Retriever.(This was obtained from the Franklin County Department of Health in Ohio for the city of Reynoldsburg, which has enforced breed specific legislation against pit bulls for thirteen years)If we applied this logic elsewhere, the argument would sound something like this:\"Domestic, U.S. made vehicles are unsafe for the public and should be banned because there are more Dodge, Jeep, Ford, Chevy, and Lincoln crashes each year in the U.S. than Honda crashes.\"--Said by nobody, ever.Which is why State Farm Insurance, the largest insurance company who collects more data than the U.S. Government and makes policy decisions simply based on risks and underwriting, does not discriminate against this loosely defined group of breeds.\"Decisions are made on a case by case basis for those instances,\" State Farm spokeswoman Heather Paul told HuffPost. \"Pit bulls in particular are often misidentified when a bite incident occurs, so reliable bite statistics related to the dogs' breed are unreliable and serve no purpose.\"Neither does the White House, Centers For Disease Control, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Bar Association, ASPCA, American Kennel Club, American Pet Dog Trainers Association, International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, American Animal Hospital Association, and the list goes on and on...Now that we know breed specific information is unreliable, what can we look at?The U.S. National Safety Council has collected data on your likelihood of being killed by a dog of any breed, as well as your likelihood of being killed by other risks.The data is defined and the parameters are clear.In 2014, the U.S. National Safety Council showed that your chances of dying by a dog bite are 1 in 116,448. That's just a number though; to put that number into perspective, your chances of dying by legal execution are pretty similar, 1 in 127,717.You are, in fact, twice as likely to die by a hornet, bee or wasp sting than a dog, 1 in 55,764.Maybe more striking is the fact that you are FAR more likely to die from eating a hot dog (choking from inhalation of food) than from being attacked by an actual dog.Death by a real dog- 1 in 116,448.Death by a hot dog- 1 in 3,375.According to the CDC, only 1.8% of all dog bites treated in Emergency Departments result in hospitalization. When a dog attacks, a child between 5-9 is statistically most likely to be bitten. As a parent, I can only imagine the horror of feeling helpless while your child is being attacked or bitten.When a pit bull type dog is involved in a bite incident, it is instantly used as a way to drive traffic to websites as the comments section is flooded with people screaming and yelling why all pit bulls are good or why all pit bulls are bad.In the midst of the mudslinging, we miss the critical opportunity to educate children on dog bite prevention, to advocate for effective dangerous dog ordinances that are breed neutral but give animal control officers the tools to do their jobs and keep communities safe, and to provide spay/neuter assistance and education to the public. The three main suggestions the Centers For Disease Control and others offer to reduce dog bites and create safer communities.We will never live in a world without dog bites or risks, nor will we ever live in a world without irresponsible people. We can, though, live in a world where dogs are judged as individuals and by their actions rather than their appearance, and owners are held accountable for the actions of their dogs.(Chesty, teaching a youth-oriented dog bite prevention class with me)(#bellethebaitdog, rescued from a suspected fighting location to teaching dog safety/bite prevention classes with me)"}, {"title": "Stop the Loss of Ocean Wildlife", "text": "Scuba diving as a young child mesmerized me. Whether a first-hand experience using scuba gear or a dazzling National Geographic documentary, looking below the waves allows a person to see a world they depend on, and one that depends upon them.Sperm whales impressively dive to depths of 3,000 feet to feed, humpback whales dazzle with their acrobatic breaches, and elusive leatherback sea turtles hunt for jellyfish. These marine animals, among many others, are an integral part of the water planet we call home. These species have inherent value as breathtaking animals and they are part of an ecosystem that generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue to California and other states as part of the coastal and ocean economy.However, these majestic animals and the coastal economy face a looming threat under the crashing waves... drift gillnets that target swordfish off the California coast. This antiquated fishing gear soaks in the ocean overnight to capture swordfish and thresher sharks. These nets, stretching a mile in length and sitting 200 feet beneath the ocean's surface, also capture whales, dolphins, sea turtles, seas lions, seals, and many species of sharks and other fish. Once entangled, air-breathing animals are unable to surface and they drown. Other animals are injured and killed in the massive curtains of net. This wasteful fishing method throws overboard more marine life than it keeps.We all have an impact on the world around us. We must decide whether we are part of the solution or part of the problem. I implore fishery managers who have responsibility over how this fishery operates to be part of the solution.In a time of innovation and sustainability there is no reason to use damaging and wasteful fishing practices. The vision for a West Coast swordfish fishery should be one that continues to provide a domestic seafood product and provides fishermen with profitability in a way that is much safer for ocean wildlife.Alternative fishing gears exist that can accomplish this vision. It is in the hands of fishery managers to make the necessary change. A transition plan must be established that helps fishermen switch out old drift gillnets for cleaner gear types like harpoons and buoy gear, two fishing methods that drastically reduce capture of unintended species and provide fishermen with a higher price per pound for their catch.Federal fishery managers meet this week to determine whether to place limits on the numbers of nine whale, sea turtle, and dolphin species that can be injured or killed by drift gillnets before the fishery shuts down for the remainder of the season. Establishing caps on the number of these species that can be allowably captured is urgently needed to help safeguard wildlife. But these limits should only serve as a temporary action while a permanent transition to clean fishing gears is made.We can have both abundant marine wildlife populations and sustainable fisheries. It just requires thoughtful, responsible leadership.

Mark Leno (D), included a measure to cut petroleum use in half by 2030, along with provisions to improve the efficiency of buildings by 50 percent and increase the amount of energy the state draws from renewables to 50 percent. The bill passed the state Senate this summer and is currently up for debate in the Assembly, but the oil provision faced pushback from the industry.The oil industry blanketed the state with television and radio ads decrying what it called the \"California Gas Restriction Act.\" The opposition fed hesitance among lawmakers to approve the overall bill and prompted leaders to drop the oil provision so the other portions could pass before the end of the legislative session on Friday.The removal of that provision is a big setback for progressive lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown (D), who championed the bill as part of the state's overall effort to address climate change.\"Oil has won the skirmish. But they've lost the bigger battle,\" Brown said at a press conference, the Los Angeles Times reported, \"because I am more determined than ever.\"De León also decried the state of affairs in a news conference Wednesday evening. \"We reached for something grand and something doable while the world prepared to once again take its cues from California,\" he said. \"But in the end -- with two days left -- we could not cut through the million-dollar smokescreen created by a single special interest with a singular motive and a bottomless war chest.\"But de León indicated the legislature will take up the issue again. \"Our resolve has not wavered one iota,\" he said. \"SB 350 will still represent historic clean-air standards, fuel significant clean-energy job creation and extend California’s global leadership in the fight to meet the climate challenge. And we are never going to take our foot off the gas in our efforts to address the impacts of petroleum, the leading cause of greenhouse emissions.\"While the oil industry lobbied against the bill, other businesses had lined up behind it. \"It’s really disappointing to see the oil lobby kill the petroleum provision by sowing enough fear that a few key legislators got cold feet,\" Kirsten James, director of the California Policy Program at Ceres, which organized dozens of state businesses in support of the bill, told the Huffington Post."}, {"title": "Vaporizing Shower Head Will Change The Way You Wash Yourself", "text": "As the west coast's drought bakes into its fifth year, a small team of California-based engineers have developed a shower head that could totally change the way we consume water -- and the way we wash ourselves.An 8-minute shower runs through about 20 gallons of water on average, according to Philip Winter and his team behind the Nebia shower head.And since shower technology hasn't changed much in the past few years, he noticed a need to improve. \"We chose showers versus other products in the home [that use water] because showers are people’s intimate emotional contact with water, where they’re least willing to make a change,\" Winter told The Huffington Post.So they looked for advanced technology they could apply to shower heads and found it in rockets. What resulted was a shower head that atomizes water streams into tiny droplets (millions, they say), giving the Nebia ten times the surface water of an average shower head while only using 30 percent of the volume, according to Gabriel Parisi-Amon, Nebia's chief technology officer, in their Kickstarter video.That means an 8-minute shower with Nebia will only use up about 6 gallons of water, which is especially good in this case, because apparently this shower head feels really nice.Nebia boasts a \"totally embracing,\" skin softening, hydrating experience that more than 500 testers enjoyed -- if you want to take a longer shower, it'd be great if you were using less water in the process.Judging by their immediately-successful Kickstarter campaign -- not only did they meet their $100,000 goal almost immediately, they raised more than $3 million -- the showering public is very interested (Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Eric Schmidt have invested, as well).Winter said they raised the money \"a lot quicker than we thought,\" which allows them to \"continue to scale it so that over the course of the time bring down the cost and make it more accessible in other parts of the country and more developing parts of the world.\"The Nebia will retail at $399.Once the shower head is succesfully launched and distributed, Winter teased other Nebia products that would conserve water elsewhere in the house, but didn't divulge specifics.\"Our immediate future plan is to make the shower head as best we can,\" he said. \"We’ll learn things off the first product we ship and improve it, and the goal is to make it a connected device so you can plug it into other smart products in your home to track water and energy use, [eventually] transitioning into faucets that have a big enough application in the home as they do in institutions.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Depressed Orphan Wombat Soothed By Cuddly Teddy Bear BFF", "text": "Kids aren't the only ones who feel a little better with their teddy bear by their side.

He visited melting glaciers and eroding villages and danced with school kids north of the Arctic Circle, but he was dogged at every step by questions about his recent approval of Shell Oil's Arctic drilling plans.Obama has done more than any previous president to restrict greenhouse gas emissions, but his administration remains stuck in a contradictory policy of promoting fossil fuel extraction that threatens to \"lock-in\" decades of emissions that we can't afford.In response to these criticisms, Obama administration officials and supporters, have tried to separate oil drilling from climate change. Senior White House advisor Brian Deese \"caution[ed] against characterizing\" Arctic drilling as undermining Obama's climate goals and highlighted the continued need for domestic oil production during the \"transition off fossil fuels.\" Secretary of State John Kerry echoed this point, stating \"Shell and other companies are going to be drilling somewhere over the course of these next years, because we're not going to suddenly be weaned from oil.\"Arctic Oil Is Not a Transition FuelWhile it is true that the U.S. won't be able to quit oil use overnight, oil extracted from beneath the Arctic Ocean is no \"transition\" fuel. Arctic oil is likely to be an expensive proposition and even Shell admits that any oil found in the Chukchi Sea won't reach market until the 2030s and the fields will have to produce for decades in order to recoup the initial investment. A recent report put out by Oil Change International and Greenpeace entitled Untouchable makes the case that Arctic oil drilling is simply incompatible with President Obama's climate goals.There is a maximum amount of greenhouse gases we can emit if we are to have a chance of limiting global warming to 2°C, and with every passing year of inaction this \"carbon budget\" gets smaller and smaller. If we don't change course, the budget will be exhausted by 2040. The hard fact is that oil companies have already discovered more oil reserves than we can safely burn. Any new Arctic discoveries would be in addition to those existing reserves and would be less economical due to a short drilling season, harsh environmental conditions and high transportation costs.It is difficult to say for certain what the \"breakeven\" price will be for Shell's offshore projects. When production costs are compared across projects, Arctic oil is the most expensive. Shell's Ann Pickard has claimed that oil from the Chukchi would be \"competitive\" at $70/barrel, but some analysts estimate that it would only make economic sense if prices were greater than $100/barrel. An influential database from Rystad Energy \"models a breakeven price of between $150 and $250 per barrel for various fields in the U.S. Arctic OCS.\" Oil is currently trading at under $50/barrel. The International Energy Agency has published future scenarios for oil production, and in its Current Policies scenario the price of oil does reach $150/barrel sometime in the mid 2030s. Unfortunately, that scenario predicts a disastrous temperature rise of 5.3°C.For these reasons, a recent study published in Nature found that 1/3 of all existing oil reserves must be left in the ground and that 100% of Arctic oil was \"unburnable\" in a 2°C scenario. Any scenario in which we are filling our gas tanks with Arctic oil is one where we have blown past the 2° limit and are well on our way to 3, 4 or even 5°C of warming.In a very real sense, Shell is betting on the failure of the climate negotiations and continued warming. In a letter to investors, Shell says as much: \"Both our scenarios and the IEA New Policies Scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions enough to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 ppm 2°C scenario. We also do not see governments taking the steps now that are consistent with the 2°C scenario.\"Supply, Not Just DemandPresident Obama has enacted a number of important policies -- such as stronger fuel efficiency standards and the Clean Power Plan -- that chip away at the demand for fossil fuels, even as he has continued policies that expand their supply. This is a big contradiction, but some commentators have put forth the idea that it is \"futile\" to try to halt the growth of fossil fuel supply because markets will adapt to replace that supply somewhere else, cancelling out any emissions reductions.That argument is thoroughly dismantled in this highly recommended post from Oil Change International. As the post makes clear, the economic argument about futility is on shaky grounds. In normal markets, expanding supply leads to lower prices and hence greater consumption (and greater emissions). The story goes that oil markets don't work like that because major players like OPEC have used their cartel power to keep overall production and prices steady. But the events of the past year show that OPEC has abandoned that strategy and the oil market has in fact responded to increased supply by dramatically lowering prices.Fossil fuel extraction projects involve high up-front costs that can \"lock-in\" dirty energy infrastructure for decades. Once that infrastructure is built, the marginal costs to pump the next barrel of oil are relatively small. This means that once a project is started it can be very hard to get rid of because oil companies will fight to recoup their investment by pumping oil for decades. Therefore the time to stop misguided oil projects is now, before critical investments are made.Most importantly, campaigns against fossil fuel supply have helped build a powerful movement for climate justice that is already achieving real policy changes. A movement of people concerned with fracking, oil trains, coal exports, tar sands pipelines, Arctic drilling and more have taken to the streets (and waterways) in recent years to demand a faster transition to a cleaner and more just economy.At the end of the day, Shell is an enormous oil company trying to maximize their profits. A big discovery in the Chukchi would be good news for their stock price but bad news for the rest of us. In Alaska, President Obama called on the nations of the world to do more to tackle climate change. It would take strong leadership to pledge to end nonsensical extraction of federal fossil fuels, but such a move is within the President's power and would greatly strengthen the message he takes to the Paris climate talks this fall."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: World on Path to Miss 2C Target", "text": "Plans submitted by world's top polluters won't limit global warming to the 2-degree Celsius threshold recommended by the United Nations, according to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a tool developed by a consortium of four European research organizations.In a report released last week at climate talks in Bonn ahead of the U.N. climate conference in Paris, the consortium said that pledges of emissions reductions--Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)--submitted by 29 governments as of Sept. 1 must be significantly strengthened. Further reductions of 12-15 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent are needed by 2025 and another 17-21 gigatons by 2030.The projections are based on CAT's analysis of 15 of the 29 INDCs. Of those 15 INDCs, covering 64.5 percent of global emissions, the analysis finds only 2 (those of Ethiopia and Morocco) are \"sufficient.\" Those of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Russia are \"inadequate,\" and those of China, the European Union, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States are \"medium,\" that is, consistent with the target.\"It is clear that if the Paris meeting locks in present climate commitments for 2030, holding warming below 2°C could essentially become infeasible, and 1.5°C beyond reach. Given the present level of pledged climate action, commitments should only be made until 2025,\" said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, one of the CAT consortium members. \"The INDCs therefore need to be considerably strengthened for the period 2020-2025.\"The CAT report also found that \"in most cases\" countries didn't have policies in place to reduce emissions to match their INDCs for 2025. China and the European Union were the exceptions.The world has already warmed up by 0.8 C--nearly half the 2 C target--and, according to CAT, is on track for 2.9-3.1 C of warming by 2100.Bonn Talks ConcludeAt climate talks in Bonn, Germany, delegates agreed to give two co-chairs of the talks permission to move forward on shrinking down a lengthy draft deal slated to be negotiated at the Conference of the Parties, November 30 to December 11, in Paris.

It finds the biggest losses from deforestation and forest degradation, which are known to increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, are in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.Even so, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that the rate of loss has slowed from 0.18 percent annually in the early 90s to 0.08 percent yearly since 2010. Globally, it notes, natural forest area is decreasing, and planted forest area is increasing.\"FRA 2015 shows a very encouraging tendency towards a reduction in the rates of deforestation and carbon emissions from forests and increases in capacity for sustainable forest management,\" said FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva. \"The direction of change is positive, with many impressive examples of progress in all regions of the world.\"FAO pointed to agriculture as the main driver of deforestation in the tropics. \"The place to start and the place to finish in many ways is the agriculture story,\" said Kenneth MacDicken, an FAO senior forestry officer (subscription). \"We need to boost intensification of food production on less land, and it's really market forces that drive food production. If the price goes high enough, people will take more risks.\"Some challenged the U.N. findings, disputing the data used to arrive at them and claiming that deforestation rates have actually increased 62 percent during the study time period.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

Scientists knew they faced certain death if left alone so they decided to bring the critically endangered pups to the Ke Kai Ola monk seal hospital in Kailua-Kona, on the Big Island of Hawaii.Over the past three months, Pearl and Hermes (named for the atoll where they were found) have been nursed back to health. They have reportedly doubled their weight on a diet of herring and other fish -- Pearl weighing in at nearly 135 pounds and Hermes at 156 -- and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration monk seal research team is now gearing up to re-release them in the wild later this month.\"It's pretty darn exciting,\" Deb Wickham, operations manager at the Ke Kai Ola, told The Huffington Post. \"Each individual counts when you only have 1,100 animals,\" she added.Found exclusively in the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of the rarest marine mammals in the world.

The remaining 200 or so inhabit the main Hawaiian Islands.Rachel Sprague, NOAA's Hawaiian monk seal recovery coordinator, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that juvenile survival is one of the major challenges for seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.“For a long time our biologists have had to turn their back and walk away from a seal they knew was going to die,\" she told the newspaper. \"Now they have a place to go.”Ke Kai Ola, which means \"the healing sea\" in Hawaiian, was funded by the Marine Mammal Center of California. It opened it's doors last September and aims to \"give monk seal pups a better shot at survival and adult seals a second chance when they need it.\"On Tuesday, the $3.2 million facility welcomed its newest patient Kilo (meaning \"sassy\" in Hawaiian), a female pup that was found abandoned during a NOAA monk seal survey the day before on the privately owned island of Niihau.NOAA and the Marine Mammal Center said in a release that Kilo -- the first seal from the Main Hawaiian Islands admitted to the new monk seal hospital, and the ninth seal overall -- would certainly have died without intervention.\"She's really emaciated,\" Wickham told HuffPost, adding that she could clearly see the pup's hips and backbone. \"But she's still got some spunk to her.\"Wickham added Kilo was already showing signs of improvement Wednesday, and that she's optimistic the \"feisty\" little pup will make a full recovery and return to the wild, likely in a few months.Last month, in an effort to further protect Hawaiian monk seals, the federal government expanded critical habitat for the species by 7,000 square miles to include areas around Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Niihau and Big Island.The Hawaiian monk seal is one of two remaining monk seal species.

Although such criticism has a point, it misses the force behind the decision to approve Arctic drilling to begin with: the National Petroleum Council (NPC) Obama's administration oversees...the NPC is an advisory committee to the Secretary of Energy consisting mostly of executives and CEOs of some of the biggest oil and gas companies on the planet. A case in point: its president is Charles D. Davidson, CEO of Noble Energy, and its vice president is the aforementioned Tillerson. As the 'advisory' badge makes clear, NPC advises and influences U.S. and more broadly, global energy policy.\"I consider myself an informed citizen yet I didn't know about the NPC. I didn't know that the people crafting our US and global energy policy are those vested in exploitation of our resources that could simultaneously destabilize our planet.Do 300 million of us just shake our head at such obscenity and say, \"That's how it is?\" Talk about giving away our power.Simultaneously I learned that a massive geopolitical power play is heating up the Arctic Circle, particularly between Russia and the US. As more land is exposed under melting glaciers, nations are competing for territory rather than heeding the warning it represents.My consternation at how little I know about issues that are vitally important to my country and our future was only increased when I received a frantic note from a friend in Washington State titled: \"Urgent alert! Olympic National Park - a military training range?\"It read: \"I recently returned from an incredible backpacking trip into one of the most gorgeous places on the planet, 7-Lakes Basin high in the Olympic Mountains, in Olympic National Park. The silence, the stillness and the spectacular beauty was exalting. My heart was overflowing with gratitude that these gorgeous wilderness areas have been protected forever, for us, the American people.\"Olympic National Park is 95% designated wilderness and is so breathtaking in its beauty, and so rich in its wildlife, it has been declared a 'World Heritage Site' by the United Nations. Its deep emerald valleys, thick with ancient rainforests, are recognized as being the 'quietest place in the contiguous United States.\"This is all about to change. Drastically. \"Get the context here.Her alarm at the looming impacts was only exceeded by the fact that this is taking place without benefit of a national conversation about the huge disruption it represents to our protected lands.What would President Roosevelt think of our society that has access to more sources of information and more influence than ever in history, yet is so uncaring and detached?A democracy cannot thrive with ignorant indifferent citizens. To be worthy of our rich public lands and environmental legacy, each one of us urgently needs to become informed and actively involved. As we approach the 2016 elections, every candidate's stance on climate, environment and public lands must be a critical component of our decision to elect them or not.Meanwhile, Here's one way we must affect the outcome in Olympic.(I hope you understand the urgency that impelled me to take this detour from our virtual tour of national parks with Congress.)"}, {"title": "Well-Traveled 250-Pound Pig, Who’s Flown Private, Is Living The Good Life", "text": "About a year ago, Kristin Hartness and Jay Yontz, and their 5-year-old pig Ziggy, found themselves in quite a pickle.The home they'd been renting for years on the island of St. John, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, had been sold, and the trio was having a tough time locking down substitute accommodations.\"We tried very hard to find a new place to rent. But as you can imagine it's not easy to find a place that will rent to people with a 250-pound pig,\" says Hartness.So the couple and their big porcine baby did what they felt was their best option: They chartered a plane to the mainland to the tune of about $14,000, bought a motor home, and then headed out on the adventure of a lifetime.\"We aren't rich but chartering was in fact the only option we could find,\" Hartness says. \"The choice between that and getting rid of him was a no-brainer.\"Moving like this is just one of the unplanned-for things in this family's life.Back half a decade ago, when Hartness was looking to acquire a pet pig, she found Ziggy -- listed for sale as a teacup pig who was never going to get large. Like just about every animal who's been advertised as such, this turned out to be an utter fiction, and he soon got extremely large.Lucky for Ziggy -- well, really, lucky for everyone -- the piggy's human parents were besotted.\"He is our boy and no matter what happens he will always be by our side,\" says Hartness, who dreams of opening an animal sanctuary for pets like Ziggy, except whose families aren't in a position -- or aren't inclined -- to comport their lives around a pig.On the island, being by Hartness and Yontz' side meant daily walks on the beach, lots of swimming and regular sessions at a local bar where Ziggy was a big cheese -- he'd sometimes even have to sneak off to \"the quiet side of the island\" to get some private time, away from his fans, Hartness says.A smart, naughty, stubborn pig, Ziggy would also get himself into trouble with some regularity. He liked to sneak out of the house and take himself for a dip at a nearby bay, for example.One time, Hartness recalls, Ziggy infiltrated a neighbor's house, where the doors had been left open. Ziggy knows how to open refrigerators and was making his way into the kitchen.Hartness tried calling Ziggy out, with no success. She had no choice -- really, no choice at all -- but to sneak into the house herself, \"and grab some chips they had left out and as quietly as possible lead him back over to our house,\" she says. \"Thankfully we made it out without anyone waking up. This is just one of many mischievous Ziggy stories.\"It was a good life, that Hartness, a former banker turned bartender, and Yontz, who designs tennis courts, had a hard time leaving behind.Thank pig, it's been good since they left, too.They all flew into Florida last October, then picked up some wheels and set off to see what the world had in store back on the mainland.\"Our plan was to figure out a plan. Still hasn't happened yet but we're still working on it,\" says Hartness.The group's been as far south as Key West, and up the East Coast to North Carolina. They've ventured west to Colorado, and Idaho and Wyoming, where Yontz has had some work.Every day, they try to find some body of water so Ziggy can go for a swim. They often go for hikes, where Ziggy \"maintains an impressive pace,\" says Hartness. Not infrequently, a stop will be made so Ziggy can chow down on a favorite treat: pancakes and fruit.Like on the island, folks often mob Ziggy for photos and questions. Ziggy's made the local papers and a number of his new appreciators have said that meeting him has convinced them to stop eating pork, which Hartness -- a vegetarian -- appreciates. There's the occasional negative remark, but that's just life.Sure, there are challenges. For instance, it turns out fussy Ziggy really doesn't like riding in the RV. So now Yontz pilots the motor home, while Hartness and Ziggy drive their own SUV. (Something that's been less challenging than expected: restaurants and hotels that are dog-friendly are surprisingly amenable to pigs as well, Hartness has learned, if you call ahead.)Hartness believes the rewards are greater than any difficulty she'll encounter, sharing this unusual existence with her great big lovable pig.\"Ziggy completes my life,\" she says. \"Seeing fat boy running on trails and swimming in lakes, rivers and in the ocean makes everything worth it. If he's happy, we're happy.\"By the way, if you've got ideas about pig-friendly destinations where Ziggy and his humans should go for the winter, they're all ears (with a bit of snout and some curly little tail).Warmer climes are preferred, but colder options aren't off the table if the spot is otherwise ideal.Big Z has \"two winter jackets that he loves to wear,\" Hartness says -- and he still loves the water when the temperatures drop. \"Even the cold weather won't keep my kid from swimming!\"Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you know a pig on a great adventure, or have another animal story to share!"}, {"title": "An Elk Promotes Funding for National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands", "text": "This summer, The Corps Network introduced Eli the Elk, a new character who has been traveling the Internet and visiting Corps across the country in support of funding that helps maintain and enhance some of our nation's most valued parks, green spaces, forests and waters.With the help of over thirty of America's Service and Conservation Corps programs, Eli has appeared in dozens of social media posts to highlight many of the great places where Corps work to improve trails, habitats, and recreational areas.One of Eli's key objectives is to promote the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Created by Congress in 1965, the LWCF is not supported by taxpayer dollars, but instead by royalties paid by oil and gas companies which have permits to drill on public lands and waters. These royalties are in turn used to support conservation projects and also purchase land for parks and conservation.The Land and Water Conservation Fund's impact is enormous. Every state has benefited from LWCF-funded projects, with a total of 41,000 state and local projects supported since the fund's creation. The Wilderness Society even created a searchable map and database showing Land and Water Conservation Fund projects by county.Eli is off to a great start spreading the word about the importance of protecting the great outdoors, but he has taken time to learn from some of his predecessors in the conservation field. He recently reached out to the U.S. Forest Service icon Woodsy Owl on Twitter for some tips.He also was honored to meet the U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell himself and Smokey Bear.In addition to continuing to support reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Eli has his eyes set on promoting other kinds of conservation funding. For instance, with the upcoming 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service, Eli plans to support the proposed Centennial Act and budget increases for the National Park Service, which would help fund important maintenance and improvement projects at national parks. Eli is also concerned about how the increasing cost of fighting fires has hampered the U.S. Forest Service budget, leaving many areas of normal Forest Service operations underfunded.If you would like to print your own copy of Eli to take on your adventures, you can find a downloadable Eli the Elk here, and also be sure to use the #Outdoors4All and #EliElk hashtags!

They protect its wide array of wildlife -- rhinoceroses, elephants, hippos and more -- from poachers and educate surrounding communities about their conservation efforts.They’ve been effective. Founded in 2013, the rangers have destroyed more than 10 poachers’ camps and reduced poachers’ snaring and poisoning activities by 76 percent, according to their website.In an announcement released Tuesday by the United Nations, the unit was credited with helping arrest six poachers and removing over 1,000 snares in the reserve. It is for these reasons that the U.N. Environmental Program gave the unit its 2015 Champions of the Earth award.“Their many successes are a result of their impressive courage and determination to make a difference in their community,” UNEP executive director Achim Steiner said in a statement. “The Black Mambas are an inspiration not only locally, but across the world to all those working to eliminate the scourge of the illegal wildlife trade.”The unit was created by Craig Spencer, the reserve’s warden and an ecologist. According to the Guardian, the unit’s rangers are formerly unemployed female high-school graduates who were took part in a rigorous, six-week tracking and combat training program.If the Black Mambas spot a poacher, who are typically armed, they call for backup in the form of armed guards.Rangers working to thwart poachers in the area have traditionally been male, but Spencer told PBS NewsHour last month that he believes the unit is actually more successful than men’s patrols. The unit is looked up to as heroes by young women in their communities.According to the Save the Rhino advocacy group, South Africa is home to the largest rhino population in the world though poaching has hit a “crisis” level in recent years. It is anticipated that, if the poaching is not abated, rhino deaths will soon overtake rhino births. In South Africa alone, a record 1,215 rhinos were killed by poachers last year.The poaching has been driven by a rising demand for rhino horn in Asian countries. As Reuters previously reported, rhino horn is sought-after in Vietnam and China as an ingredient in traditional medicine and can fetch an estimated $65,000 per kilogram, almost $30,000 a pound, more than gold.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Hot? Think About the GDP", "text": "There is a considerable amount of griping these days about how hot the weather has become. Frankly, I'm tired of it. The so-called climate hawks are always looking for something to complain about without recognizing the silver lining in the furnace, so to speak.Let's stop bitching for a moment and count our blessings.First, the record-hot temperatures we see around the United States today mean we all can wear fewer clothes. Think of this as the eye-candy effect in which very short shorts and very small tops for women, plus no tops at all for men, are the norm year-round. This will be bad for the clothing industry, of course, but good for the national libido, assuming the clothing I just described is limited to people with less than 20 percent body fat.Second, consider the long-term benefits for our species. I don't mean to be heartless, but heat waves already are our No. 1 weather killer. Think of the evolutionary upside as heat waves get even hotter. The weak and the poor will succumb while the strong and the 1 percent, with their unlimited funds for air conditioning, will survive. Bottom line: A better homo sapien.Third, the rapid rise in air conditioning bills, broad-brimmed hats, emergency medical care, bottled water, sunscreen, deodorants, antiperspirant pads, swimming pools and heat rash ointments will more than make up for the downsizing of the clothing industry. These products will be a year-round stimulus for the economy. If you are one of the malcontents complaining about the heat, you are thinking only about yourself and not the GDP, without which none of us would be happy.We hear a lot of complaints, too, about melting glaciers and sea-level rise. When was the last time a glacier did anything for you? Rising sea levels just mean that more of us will live closer to the beach, which is a good thing given all this damn heat. Again, we have to think of the big picture here.As somebody once said, everybody is talking about the weather, but nobody is doing anything about it. So stop complaining and get used to it."}, {"title": "Environmental Concern Empowers the People", "text": "Environmental awareness, once enjoyed only by a niche group within society, has mushroomed in the last decade so that today it directly drives changes in consumers' purchasing behaviors. Only 30 years ago, the terms \"climate change\" and \"sustainability\" were barely recognized. But today, fewer consumers remain unaware of these terms. In many cases, this awareness translates into action.Two-thirds of consumers consciously choose to avoid specific brands or items due to environmental concerns, a figure that has increased by 26% in the last six years, according to Tetra Pak's latest environmental research, which involved surveying 6,000 consumers across 12 countries, including the U.S. The transition from consumer concern to consumer action is driving positive change in industry, with global companies such as Unilever, Coca-Cola and Danone making sustainability central to their brands' core values.Beyond our research, we see a number of factors driving this acceleration in environmental awareness. First, the unrelenting campaigning of global influencers, the media and international institutions like the World Bank, has called for government, industry and society to act together to adapt to the limits imposed by the finite quantity of natural resources. This effort may be working: Recently, 13 of the largest U.S. companies backed President Obama's quest to tackle U.S. carbon emissions. Their commitment shows the impact of consumers' environmental awareness and how shoppers' voting with their dollars gets results.Second, the digital revolution has led to a world more connected than ever before; according to the Pew Research Center, 64% of Americans own smartphones, a number nearly doubled in four years. Widespread access to the Internet and new media means consumers have greater access to information, and companies may be held to greater standards of transparency and accountability.Taking Action for the Planet The result of having greater information access and knowledge is that consumers today, particularly those with children, feel greater responsibility to look after the planet for future generations. And more importantly, it means consumers feel empowered to take action, and this shapes the way they buy products across a range of industries, generating market opportunities.For example, organic food sales have increased from \"$3.6 billion in 1997 to over $39 billion in 2014\" across the U.S. marketplace, while global sales of electric cars doubled every year between 2012-2014, notes the Organic Trade Association. Within the food and beverage industry, 39% of consumers said the environment has high influence on the beverage brand they buy, according to our research. Two-thirds said they bought environmental products--even if they cost more.Making The Triple Bottom Line A Reality Industry leaders foresaw this trend and incorporated concern for the environment as a central part of their business strategies. For some organizations, the \"triple bottom line\" of people, planet and profit envisioned in the early 1990s is becoming a reality. Our research shows 93% of food manufacturers and retailers worldwide have environmental initiatives. These include ensuring product recyclability, looking at manufacturing equipment and operations to minimize waste and energy consumption and incorporating responsibly sourced materials. Much of the industry is focused on using responsibly sourced materials, with some companies, including Tetra Pak, taking the practice a step further and making renewability--the use of materials that can be regrown or replenished over time--a key element in product differentiation.Despite these advances, last year, 65% of U.S. consumers believed companies do not pay enough attention to the environment, according to an Ipsos global poll. That may be a sign that more needs to be done or that businesses are not doing enough to communicate their environmental initiatives, regardless of what spurred those activities, be it consumer action or business needs to lower costs or secure supply chains.This presents an unprecedented opportunity for companies to show their contributions in supporting environmental sustainability through research, innovation and product design. Packaging serves a dual role for businesses and consumers. First, it is part of the environmental solution and needs to be consistent with a product's distinctive selling proposition--the natural properties of a food or beverage product should not clash with the environmental attributes of its packaging. Our research shows that over three-quarters of consumers are more likely to consider a brand using sustainable materials instead of standard packaging, with cartons among the preferred choice.Second, packaging is a channel to communicate environmental credentials. According to our research, 7 of 10 consumers actively look for environmental information on packaging, compared with less than four in 2009. More than half say that logos, such as those of the Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC™) or the Mobius Loop, which shows a circle of arrows to indicate a package is recyclable, are useful to understand a package's environmental impact and make the brand more appealing.  Acting In Response To Consumer Environmental Concern As concern for the environment continues to influence buying behavior, it will increasingly drive change within corporate America. While environmental actions may have been traditionally driven by business strategies to reduce costs, increase efficiencies or ensure future growth, consumer awareness and purchasing power will drive corporations further. Strong environmental credentials are no longer a \"nice-to-have\" but soon can become a business imperative. The Internet's ubiquity means consumers can research businesses and more easily hold them accountable. Thus, communicating the action taken becomes as important as the sustainability initiatives themselves.Using sustainable packaging is a win-win situation for the people and the environment alike. Seeing companies respond to consumers' environmental concerns clearly demonstrates power to the people in action.Photo credit: Wedmann"}, {"title": "What The Marijuana Lobby Could Offer Hillary Clinton", "text": "Hillary Clinton says she has never smoked pot, not even as a bell-bottom-wearing undergraduate in the 1960s.

Let me see, ah, here it is:\"The summit between China and the United States, scheduled for the end of September, has been cancelled at the insistence of the Republican Party.\"Ah, that wasn't it either. Okay, finally, here's the right one:\"The much-anticipated meeting between President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping in Washington will be business as usual, as boring as an unseasoned beanburger, and contribute very little to solving any of the pressing issues of the day.\"That, alas, is closer to the truth.Both China and the U.S. face enormous challenges at home, common security problems, and an array of international crises that could really use the coordinated efforts of two superpowers. But the U.S. and China have about as much capacity to work together at the moment as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush.As we near the 14 anniversary of September 11, the painful truth is that the U.S. is still trying to dig itself out from under the wreckage of the Bush years.Our national security policy remains fixated on terrorism threats that only proliferated after the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Our military budget, an enormous drain on the economy, is still up in the stratosphere. Even the greatest diplomatic success of the Obama administration -- the recent nuclear deal with Iran -- should have been concluded more than a decade ago, when Tehran was as freaked out as the U.S. was by the Sunni extremism of al-Qaeda.One of the many opportunity costs of the Bush response to September 11 was Washington's reluctance to sit down with Beijing to work out a post-post-Cold War world that could accommodate China's economic rise without its bitter military aftertaste. The U.S. reliance on full-spectrum military dominance to deal with a full spectrum of problems sent a powerful message to China: bulk up or stay home. The upcoming summit will be the last chance to bolster the fragile partnership before the ritual China-bashing of the presidential election cycle once again strains the ties between Washington and Beijing.Can President Obama make a real pivot to Asia that engages rather than contains China -- and, just as importantly, harnesses the power of the two global behemoths to change the world?Duopoly: Not in the CardsGone are the days when big thinkers like Zbigniew Brzezinski , Niall Ferguson, and Fred Bergsten urged the United States and China to form a Group of Two to sort out the world's problems. It was a Brady Bunch proposal: Since mother and father had their hands full trying to manage their unruly children, why not join forces to bring order to an unharmonious world?Four years ago, Richard Bush published his epitaph for the Brady Bunch idea:It is fair to say...that people outside the United States paid far more attention to Brzezinski's and Bergsten's G-2 idea than did Americans themselves. The proposal sank like a stone in Washington but caused great ferment overseas, particularly among countries that would be unhappy if Beijing and Washington acted upon the idea.Today, little remains of the mutual enthusiasm that Obama and Hu Jintao expressed in their first Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 2009. It's not quite as moribund as the \"reset\" with Russia, but that flirtation between China and the United States certainly didn't produce the marriage that Brzezinski and Bergsten imagined.Indeed, this summer President Obama even began to consider a round of economic sanctions against China for a range of alleged hacks, including the theft of data from more than 20 million people at the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management (OPM).Mind you, the president was not overly vocal about the issue, and it looks like the Obama administration is reconsidering. The sanctions will likely target companies, not countries. \"That's because the Obama administration is wary of imposing sanctions for normal state-sponsored intelligence gathering tactics the U.S. government itself employs on an ongoing basis,\" writes Katie Bo Williams in The Hill.That's putting it mildly. No less than James Clapper, the director of national intelligence,admitted in regard to the OPM theft: \"If we had the opportunity to do the same thing, we'd probably do it.\"Remember: This is an administration that taps into the cell phones of the leaders of allied countries, sucks up all manner of data from foreigners, and uses computer viruses to disrupt the infrastructure of U.S. adversaries. What is the National Security Agency but Hacker Central?It turns out that the other major points of friction in the U.S.-China relationship are similarly complicated. Yes, China sent a couple of military ships up around the Arctic Circle recently, but they were in international waters. If the Obama administration complained, which it didn't, China would point to all those surveillance flights that the U.S. conducts near Chinese territory.Or consider China's effort to claim as much of the South China Sea as it can get away with, much to the consternation of the other countries bordering that body of water. The U.S. is not engaged in any similar contest over territory, on land or sea, at least not explicitly. But we long ago turned the Pacific into an \"American lake,\" and we've expended lives and money in the Middle East to, among other things, preserve access to the energy we need for our economy.And then there's the whole currency manipulation \"scandal.\"Yuan Fight?Let's see if I've gotten this straight about China and its currency.Over the summer, the largest and only remaining significant Communist country in the world allowed the yuan to fall in value in response to market forces. This move by a Communist country to allow global capitalism to have more impact on its currency received praise from none other than the International Monetary Fund.But one of the most prominent billionaire capitalists in the U.S., who has made at least some of his lucre from dealing with China, blasted his erstwhile trade partner for its financial manipulations. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump argued that China was \"making it absolutely impossible for the U.S. to compete.\"The ironies here are many. But even if we take Trump out of the equation -- and god knows, many people would like to see just that happen -- the U.S. can't really complain about what China is doing. The dollar floats, so the U.S. government can't intervene directly to manipulate its value relative to other currencies -- for instance, by lowering it to make U.S. exports cheaper. But it can do a number of indirect things. The Federal Reserve, for instance, has kept the interest rate low-- well, specifically the fed funds rate -- since 2009 to stimulate the economy.China could conceivably complain about such \"manipulations.\" But it knows that a sick U.S. economy would infect China immediately. So, from Beijing's point of view, the U.S. should \"manipulate\" as much as it can to help keep the global economy afloat.Agenda, InterruptedExpectations are low for the upcoming U.S.-China summit.The only commitment of any value that might come of the meeting would be a follow-up on climate change ahead of the big UN conference in December. There's plenty room for improvement. For instance, last year's accord between Obama and Xi only signaled only theintent of both sides: the U.S. to reduce carbon emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and China to up the non-fossil fuels in its energy use to 20 percent by 2030.Of course, there's a good reason for the two sides stopping at \"intent.\" An actual agreement would constitute a treaty, and then the Senate would have to weigh in. And what the two sides agreed to is not inconsequential, as The Washington Post notes:The scale of construction for China to meet its goals is huge even by Chinese standards. It must add 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar, and other zero-emission generating capacity by 2030 -- more than all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to the total electricity generating capacity of the United States.As for the U.S.:...to meet its target, the United States will need to double the pace of carbon pollution reduction from 1.2 percent per year on average from 2005 to 2020 to 2.3 to 2.8 percent per year between 2020 and 2025.There isn't much more to discuss on these proposals; both sides just have to implement the necessary domestic changes to meet these goals. They can also strategize on how to bring other major countries on board, as they did recently with Brazil.Good as these initiatives are, they're just not good enough. Cue the authoritative voice of The New York Times:It is increasingly evident that the policy actions by these countries and others will not be enough to stave off a rise in the atmospheric temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point, scientists say, the planet will be locked into a future of extreme storms, droughts, food and water shortages, and rising sea levels.Put another way: Despite all the meetings, promises, and apocalyptic threats, global carbon emissions have risen from the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 until today -- from around 6.5 billion metric tons per year to nearly 10 billion. If both China and the U.S. had tackled this issue back in 2001, perhaps we wouldn't currently be in this pickle. Chalk that up as another opportunity cost (which might just cost us the planet).Instead of haggling over currency, hacking, and sea-lanes, the two superpowers should be thinking big. Between them, the U.S. and China account for nearly one-third of the global economy, nearly one-quarter of the world's population, and more than two-fifths of the world's carbon emissions. What these two countries do by definition has an enormous global impact.So, let's go back to that first imaginary press release to reconsider the challenges of the post-post-Cold War era and turn them into some bullet points:This is the agenda interrupted by September 11. It's not too late for the United States and China to get together and lead the conversation back to these critical issues. But it's not going to happen by either cancelling the upcoming summit or treating it like just another obligatory photo op.It's no time for a bunch of bickering children to control the agenda. The adults have to retake control, beginning with Barack and Jinping Brady.Crossposted with Foreign Policy In Focus"}, {"title": "Scientists Design Killer Robot To Protect Celebrated Reef", "text": "A killer robot might just be the hero the Great Barrier Reef needs to protect it from a booming population of coral-eating creatures.As the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) ravages the famed Australian reef, a team of researchers has designed a search-and-destroy bot to deliver lethal injections and bring the COTS population back down to a manageable level.Researchers at the Queensland University of Technology later this month will send their so-called COTSbot on its first hunt for live starfish at the reef. If successful, the robot could replace human divers as the first line of defense for controlling COTS outbreaks and, when deployed in fleets of 10 to 100, could cover more ground -- day or night and under any weather conditions -- than the divers who are sent to manually inject the starfish.The submersible robot uses a combination of cameras, GPS, sensors and thrusters, along with starfish-detecting software, to identify the COTS among the coral. Once it finds its target, the COTSbot uses an extendable arm to reach down and deliver a single injection of bile salts, which should kill the starfish without harming the surrounding reef's fragile environment. The robot is designed to search the reef for up to eight hours at a time and can deliver more than 200 lethal injections, one per starfish.Feras Dayoub, a roboticist at the university who designed the software, spent months training the COTSbot to differentiate between these particular starfish and other sea life by showing it images and videos of the reef.\"The system has seen thousands of images of COTS and not COTS,\" Dayoub told the Australian Broadcasting Company. \"Now it's able to detect and decide which one is COTS and which one is not.\"When their population numbers are low, the venomous COTS, which are native to Australian and Indo-Pacific reefs, can actually help increase coral diversity by consuming coral. However, when their populations spike -- possibly due to runoff from land during wet seasons -- the starfish consume coral faster than it can grow and have devastating impacts on reef habitats.Between 1985 and 2012, researchers observed a 50 percent decline in the coral cover across the Great Barrier Reef -- COTS were said to be responsible for nearly half that decline. In 2015, 18 percent of the reefs surveyed had active COTS outbreaks, according to a study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science.Previously, divers culled the starfish's populations by diving down to the Great Barrier Reef and administering the injections by hand at targeted sites. But, says Matthew Dunbabin, one of the robot's creators, \"there just aren't enough divers to cover all the COTS hotspots across the Great Barrier Reef.\"\"We see the COTSbot as a first responder for ongoing eradication programs deployed to eliminate the bulk of COTS in any area, with divers following a few days later to hit the remaining COTS,\" Dunbabin, a roboticist for the university's Institute for Future Environment, said in a statement.The deadly robot completed its first round of sea trials last week. When researchers send it on its first hunt for living targets later this month, it will photograph all of its potential kills so that they can first be verified by a human.\"We've done six months of hardcore training on this system and the reliability is astronomical,\" Dunbabin told ABC. \"The data we get [during the next trial] will be used to refine our system. It's very robust now but it will be even better when it's finished.\"The COTSbot will also continue to learn from its experience while it works in the field, Dayoub said in a statement.\"Its computer system is backed by some serious computational power so [it] can think for itself in the water,\" Dayoub said.Below, preview the COTSbot's killer technology as its software identifies crown-of-thorns starfish among the coral.See the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef below:"}, {"title": "Meet The Black Mambas, South Africa's Majority-Female Anti-Poaching Unit", "text": "\"I am strong.

Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Bachher announced on Wednesday that the university system had sold off about $200 million of its direct holdings in coal and oil sands companies.Bachher said the investments were “no longer good” ones for UC’s $98.2 billion fund. Shrinking global demand, “sustainability issues” and other factors have rendered such investments risky, he said.The announcement comes almost exactly a year after the university system’s regents committee announced it would not sell off stocks and holdings in oil, coal and natural gas. At the time, the committee said they were “trying to balance the cause of climate change with the need to earn strong financial returns in the funds that support pensions, faculty chairs and scholarships,” according to The Los Angeles Times.Environmental activists are already celebrating UC’s recent divestment.“Big victory,” declared Go Fossil Free on Twitter Wednesday night. The movement, which is dedicated to pushing institutions to end their investments in coal, oil and natural gas, has been urging UC to ditch fossil fuels for years.However, despite the optimism, the university has been clear that its official policy regarding fossil fuel companies has not changed.University spokeswoman Dianne Klein told Reuters that UC is still free to invest in such companies “if the market circumstances” warrant it.In addition, Klein said the university has no plans to let go of its holdings and stocks in oil and natural gas. She told the Los Angeles Times that UC still has about $10 billion in various types of energy industry investments.Alden Phinney, a UC Santa Cruz student and an activist with Fossil Free UC, told the Times that though the recent divestment is “a really good move by the university,” a push for “full divestment” is still pressing.Since 2011, more than 35 colleges and universities worldwide, including Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Washington, and Oxford University in the U.K., have ditched investments in fossil fuels.Like in the case of UC, however, some of these divestments have been specifically focused on coal. Activists say such partial divestments aren't a big enough step forward.“It's sort of a foregone conclusion that coal is dying, which is why it’s fairly easy for institutions to pull out of coal,” Karthik Ganapathy, the domestic communications manager at 350.org, the organization leading the Go Fossil Free campaign, told The Huffington Post in June. “Our position is that we want to see institutions follow through and divestment from the entire fossil fuel industry. We think broadly that commitments like this one are important and good first steps that give the institutions an in into considering and acting on full divestment.”Last week, the California state legislature passed a bill requiring its two large state pension funds -- Calpers and CalSTRS -- to divest from coal mining companies.“Coal is losing value quickly and investing in coal is a losing proposition for our retirees,” said Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León, the bill's author, per Reuters. “It's a nuisance to public health and it's inconsistent with our values as a state on the forefront of efforts to address global climate change.”The burning of fossil fuels is the primary human activity affecting the amount and rate of climate change. Last year, South African social rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu argued that an “apartheid-style boycott” of fossil fuel companies was necessary to “save the planet.”“There are many ways that all of us can fight against climate change: by not wasting energy, for instance. But these individual measures will not make a big enough difference in the available time,” he said. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change … It makes no sense to invest in companies that undermine our future.

My legislation will hold Administrator McCarthy accountable for her blatant deceptions and unlawful conduct.\"The accusations are tied to the EPA's Clean Water Rule, which clarifies which waters the government can protect from pollution under the Clean Water Act. While the Obama administration says the new rule only safeguards wetlands, tributaries and small streams that historically have already been protected by the agency, opponents say the new rule is expanding the EPA's jurisdiction to the detriment of farmers and the agricultural industry.Gosar claims McCarthy lied about the EPA's oversight and how the rule was finalized during multiple congressional hearings on the new regulations this year.\"Administratior Regina McCarthy, by such conduct, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office and disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States,\" reads the proposed resolution.An EPA spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.While Gosar's accusation of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" is the first call to impeach McCarthy over the new rule, the regulation has faced strong Republican opposition. In May, the House voted 261-155 to overturn the rule, despite President Barack Obama's veto threat. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted in favor of similar legislation in June.The rule has also faced obstacles in the courts. In August, a federal judge granted a request by 13 states -- including Gosar's home state of Arizona -- to block the rule. Other legal challenges to the regulation are still pending.The EPA has stood by the rule as it goes into effect in 37 states, arguing the new regulations will protect millions of Americans' drinking water from pollution.Read more on the EPA rule here.H/T: The HillAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "The World's Most Athletic Dog Breeds", "text": "There are so many reasons to love dogs: their unyielding loyalty, their sloppy smiles, their caring companionship, their unbridled excitement to see us when we walk through the door.Click Here to see the Complete List of The World's Most Athletic Dog BreedsOh yeah, and then there's also the fact that they may help keep us healthy. According to the American Heart Association, dog owners are 54 percent more likely to reach the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly recommended amount of exercise.So, Fido's innate need for activity may just play a role in helping you fend off heart disease and other ailments associated with an overly sedentary lifestyle, but which types of pups are most athletic by nature?Well, that's not exactly an easy question to answer.Athletic dogs come in all shapes and sizes. Some are small and swift, while others are big and brawny. Think about it, human athleticism is measured in many different qualities: speed, strength, agility, endurance. The greatest athletes demonstrate all of these characteristics, but some stand out for one or two in particular.Essentially, the same concept applies to dogs. However, according to American Kennel Club (AKC) spokesperson Lisa Peterson, comparing one breed to another is akin to comparing apples to oranges.\"Each of the 180 AKC-recognized breeds has a standard developed by the Parent Club (National Breed Club), which details the individual requirements to determine athleticism and fitness by breed,\" Peterson said. \"So a fit Cavalier King Charles Spaniel would be different than a fit Elkhound, for example.\"That said, there are in fact some breeds that are naturally more apt towards athleticism than others.\"Certain breeds just have a more natural athletic ability because of what they were originally bred to do,\" says Victoria Swanson, a professional dog trainer from Grand Rapids, Michigan. For example, working breeds like the Siberian Husky love to exercise and perform for their owners.Oh yeah, and while your furry friend can certainly help you stay fit, Sherry Woodard, resident animal behavior consultant at Best Friends Animal Society, noted that good, regular medical care, a nutritious diet and consistent exercise are essential for keeping your dog healthy and strong.\"I love working with dogs on their mental health as well,\" she said. \"Mental exercise also keeps them fit. Offering dogs puzzles -- treat-dispensing toys, hiding things around the house and the yard so they use their senses to find them -- builds amazing skills. Mental exercise also does tire the dogs out.\"In 2013 Swanson helped us narrow down a list of 12 of the \"fittest\" (or most athletic) dog breeds. This year, in our quest to expand those results (after all, there are many, many types of truly athletic dogs), we recruited the help of Woodard as well.She said the breeds she chose landed a spot on her list because they're energetic and they love to interact with people and stay fit.So, which canines demonstrate athletic qualities more than any others?

The colleague, Eldon Kurtz, promptly replied, \"What are you smoking in your pipe?\"Smith didn't win the competition but it proved to be the inspiration for one of the few ways that solar energy can work at least for tax-exempt organizations in Virginia: a version of a power purchase agreement, or PPA.Power purchase agreements were getting traction in many states through the mid-2000s. Under a traditional PPA, the solar developer designs, permits, finances, installs and owns a solar system at its cost, not the customer's. The developer sells the power to the customer at a rate typically lower than the local utility's rate and banks the income from the sales along with any tax credits and other incentives the system qualifies for. One incentive is the option, where allowed, to sell excess electricity back to the grid under \"net metering\" policies.One problem with this traditional model for Smith: it wouldn't work in Virginia. Yet his interpretation of state law did, technically, permit PPAs.Because EMU bought its electricity a municipal utility serving the town of Harrisonburg, Smith saw an opportunity. With EMU's cooperation and its stated commitment to sustainability, the University could own a solar system to supply a portion of its own power while reducing carbon emissions in the community. It could walk the talk of sustainability. But Smith was getting ahead of himself.At one point, the Harrisonburg Electric Commission's top brass thought it would make up for the loss in revenue from EMU by raising rates that it would charge the university. It also considered crediting EMU with any electricity supplied back to its grid at the wholesale power rate, not the higher retail rate the customers paid, leading to some edgy negotiations.The parties came together after Harrisonburg community activist and local attorney, Tom Domonoske, weighed in on behalf of Secure Futures. Both Smith and Domonoske appealed to the Harrisonburg commission about how the solar system would clearly demonstrate its \"care for creation\" and the community's \"common good\". Yet it wasn't until the duo could help EMU also see the benefits in \"hard dollars,\" Domonoske said, did university officials agree to terms. \"I remember us saying to each other,\" Domonoske said, \"it's going to happen. We're going to get there!\"Eastern Mennonite University business professor Tony Smith answers questions from community members about the solar array (in background) he designed and developed. CREDIT: Eastern Mennonite UniversityThe 104-kilowatt deal -- the largest solar energy system in Virginia at the time -- was signed with net metering at the retail rate, the first of its kind in Harrisonburg.\"This opened up the solar market in Virginia for non-profits,\" said Ivy Main, a leader of the Sierra Club in Virginia and a frequent critic of monopoly utilities in the state. \"Tony found a little sweet spot without running afoul of tax laws. He had to know how to put together these types of deals.\"\"Tony's playing an important role in the expansion of the solar industry in Virginia,\" said Cale Jaffe, Director of the Virginia Office of the Southern Environmental Law Center.\"Power companies in Virginia have been exhibiting classic monopolistic behavior in throwing road blocks in from of the small, solar entrepreneurs,\" Jaffe added. \"Tony's been at the tip of the spear in pushing against those monopolistic tendencies, working to open markets to solar innovators and give customers more choices.\"Along with Domonoske, Smith credits the gregariousness and ingenuity of his partner and master electrician, Hugh Stoll, for helping realize that an enterprise focused on the triple bottom line of sustainability -- people, planet and profit -- could persevere and \"buffer us through the challenges we faced.\"About 60 miles south of Harrisonburg off I-81, leaders at Washington & Lee University (W&L) in Lexington took notice and embarked with Secure Futures on a similar transaction in 2011.With funds from the federal American Relief and Recovery Act grant paving the way, it was smooth sailing though about the midway point of construction in September 2011 when Washington & Lee and Secure Futures received a cease-and-desist order from Dominion Virginia Power, W&L's electric utility. Dominion asserted it violated its rights as the monopoly electric utility serving Lexington.With one attorney at his side, Smith sought legal relief at the State Corporation Commission (SCC). But he couldn't quickly win the required authorization to proceed. Smith said he was \"outflanked\" by - count 'em - 11 attorneys from Dominion before a regulatory body that is widely viewed to be very accommodating to Dominion.Smith pressed on. So Dominion sent him a second cease-and-desist order, making it clear it would do what ever it takes to stop him. Perhaps Dominion's top brass figured if it lost this battle, it could pave the way for similar deals. And that could nominally eat into its profits and perhaps the perceived value of the parent company's stock; this despite being a monopoly utility serving two-thirds of all electricity users in Virginia.To prevail, Smith would have to fight it all the way to the state Supreme Court, which had political leanings of its own. Even so, such a battle would have taken the project beyond the system's December 31, 2012 completion date. So Smith pivoted and turned the PPA into a 20-year equipment lease to keep some sort of a deal alive. And it worked.What became a 444 kilowatt system at W&L was far less profitable for Secure Futures because it could not deduct depreciation on an accelerated basis. But it set a noteworthy example for policymakers to learn from. In the eyes of many clean energy advocates, it helped focus attention on Dominion's behavior, its influence elected officials throughout the Commonwealth and its unwillingness to enable an open market for solar energy in Virginia. David Botkins, a spokesman for Dominion, declined to comment on Smith's ventures.Not to be out done, Smith pivoted again, this time to craft a template for customers to generate their own power with a system financed, built, owned, operated and maintained by Secure Futures for a fee while guaranteeing the system's performance, not its power output.Smith wanted to test this model and found the tiny First United Church of Christ - just down the highway from Dominion's largest power plant, in Chesterfield, Virginia -- to acquire a small, 3.5 kilowatt, system to generate about 10% of its power. The transaction, dubbed a \"solar customer self-generation agreement,\" allowed the church to go solar with no money down.\"What the customer self-generation agreement does is send a signal to people who want to find a way to go solar and who won't stand for Dominion's delaying tactics,\" said Main.Efforts to engage Dominion, meanwhile, on PPA legislation that it could live with leading up to the 2013 Virginia General Assembly barely got started before Dominion all but slammed the door on negotiations. Dominion eventually agreed to legislation that was signed into law by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell and authored principally by Sen. John Edwards, a Democrat from Roanoke, to allow a pilot program totaling up to 50 megawatts throughout Dominion's vast service territory.In the roughly 18 months that followed, Dominion embarked on solar systems totaling a mere 2.7 megawatts, including its largest single system to date - 750 kilowatts - that went live in early July in Sterling, Virginia.Compare Virginia Power's track record to the investor-owned utility in neighboring North Carolina. There, Duke Energy, the nation's largest electricity utility, thus far has deployed about 100 megawatts of solar. Further south, Georgia Power has installed 168 MWs of solar throughout the Peach State.A law that went into effect July 1 in Georgia empowers third parties to sell solar systems to end-users there. No such law is given any chance of being seriously considered in Virginia due largely to Dominion's influence on the governorship and both parties in the state's General Assembly.The efforts by Tony Smith and other solar developers in Virginia might change that by proving solar's value to consumers and to the state's economy, which is smarting from cutbacks in defense spending. Botkins, the Dominion spokesman, asserts now it is \"all over solar\" with a pledge to develop up to 400 MWs by 2020.It's easy to conclude that Smith might be one of the larger factors in Dominion Virginia Power seeing the value of solar, albeit for systems it owns, not its customers.'Smith is applying the model established for the church in Chesterfield for public school districts in Virginia to walk the talk about cleaner energy. Under its Solar Schools Initiative, a school buys the power off the panels and leases its roof space while Secure Futures buys, installs, maintains, and owns the panels.Students, faculty and alumni pose in front of Sutherland Middle School in Ablemarle County, VA after it was announced the district school system will install solar energy at six schools. Tony Smith is standing, far right. CREDIT: Secure FuturesThe public school district that serves Albemarle County became the first public school district in Virginia to go solar under one of these agreements earning accolades from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. A full megawatt of solar panels on six schools throughout Charlottesville and the surrounding area is expected to meet about 6% of the entire district's annual electricity requirements.The next power pivot by Smith may be unveiled soon. Smith shared with The Energy Fix a partnership to be announced for financing solar projects with a large corporation that he said shares his triple bottom line values."}, {"title": "Sarah Palin Claims Glaciers Are Growing, So Obviously Humans Didn't Cause Climate Change", "text": "Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Meet The Favorite Pets Of Britain's Longest-Reigning Monarch", "text": "Queen Elizabeth II was recognized on Wednesday as Britain's longest-reigning monarch after 23,226 days on the throne.

Its oil industry opponents are desperate to stop it, claiming the proposal will drive up prices at the pump. In fact, Senate Bill 350, currently written to cut California's gasoline use in half by 2030, will actually lower gasoline prices by increasing scarce gasoline inventories.That's why Big Oil is trying to amend the legislation into oblivion.  It's simple supply and demand. Decrease demand, increase supply, decrease the price.  Chronically low inventories of gasoline have plagued California over the last year, as charted by the California Energy Commission. That's the reason Angelenos paid nearly $1 dollar more per gallon over Labor Day than Americans did.  With crude oil prices at historic lows, Golden State drivers have paid $5.3 billion more than US drivers since February, when refineries started to go down. That's after adjusting for marginal tax differentials and amounts to $225 more for every California driver.  The same problem of low inventories and periodic gasoline prices spikes has persisted over the last decade and one half, albeit without such dramatic cost consequences. Before 2015, the top gap between California and nationwide gasoline prices had been no more than 80 cents. This year the gap went over $1.50 in LA County.  The four oil refiners that control 78% of California's gasoline market claim California's special blend of clean burning fuel is to blame for persistent inventory problems and price differentials with the US, creating a geographic island.   Their second quarter refining profits show, however, that the state's top refiners had their best profits ever from refining oil into California gasoline -- or rather not making enough of it to go around.  By keeping us running on empty, every time a refinery goes down, gas prices and oil refiner profits go up.  Chevron, the state's top refiner, reported its best first half of the year from refining ever. Number two, Tesoro, posted its best second quarter from California refining profits ever. Fourth biggest refiner, Valero, showed an 1100% profit increase off California refining over last year.  The consolidation of California's refining market in the hands of the Big 4 has prevented Californians from enjoying the benefits of plummeting crude oil prices.   Instead, according to California Energy Commission data, oil refiners in this state took home triple their usual margins in July rather than passing on the crude savings to consumers. $1.61 of every gallon went into their pockets.  California's oil refiners are the only industry in America who make more money when their factories break.  Few dispute that low gasoline inventories in California are here to stay without a major change because it's so profitable for the Big 4 refiners.   With aging refining capacity (one is 113 years old), and no new refineries likely to come on line, the problem will only worsen.  Why would refiners build more refining capacity if they can charge more for making less gasoline? And with crude oil at historic lows, Californians gas pumps are the refiners' most reliable ATM.  That's why Senate Bill 350's mandate to limit petroleum use and free up supply comes to the aid of the consumer, not just the climate. The bill breaks the hold of oil refiners over the market by cutting their market share in half and freeing refining capacity.  The mandate for 50% petroleum reduction in 15 years is much like the American mission to the moon. We didn't know how exactly we would get there when we set the goal but we knew the technology was available to do it.  There's little question EV battery cells with greater range will come on line at significantly reduced costs in the next five years. Petroleum-based vehicles are gaining more gasoline efficiency due to new federal standards that will get the state significantly closer to its goal. Hydrogen, bio-diesel and other non-petroleum fuels for government and corporate fleets are a big part of the solution. Incentives for the use of EV and alternative fuel vehicles can get us to the goal with carrots and not sticks.  We cannot un-ring the bell of oil refiner consolidation, but we can set a goal of incentivizing cleaner vehicle fuel technologies that create competition for the oil refiners and lower fuel costs. In the new age of climate change, cleaner and cheaper energy can and must go together.  Legislators on the fence about SB 350 may fear the government will pump up prices with new taxes to discourage driving. But the greater threat of higher pump prices has always come from the oil refiners themselves and the oligopolistic power they now enjoy.  Who should Californians trust more: government regulators or oil refiners? Given the Golden State gouging, there's little question.  Cheaper fuel is one more argument why California needs to do the right thing and lead the way for the world on limiting greenhouse gases. __________________________________________________________________________  Jamie Court is a founder of CapitolWatchdog.org and a former member of the California Attorney General's Taskforce on Gasoline Pricing."}, {"title": "Horse Brings Hay To His 'Girlfriend,' Proves He's Well-Bred", "text": "We're not experts on equine romance, but we know a smooth move when we see one.T the horse brings his \"girlfriend\" Layla some hay to eat, according to the YouTube description posted by Jessica Munn.They share nibbles and nuzzles without talking about work.A nice date for any species!H/T Elite DailyAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "The Huffington Post Is Hiring A Green Reporter", "text": "Location: Washington, D.C., New York City, or San Francisco Position Type: Full TimeAbout the Role:The Huffington Post is seeking a sharp, dynamic reporter to join our Green team.

But opponents of lowering the standard have a well-informed ally: a former EPA official who was involved in developing the updated standard.The agency's draft proposal, released last November, called for lowering the range of permissible ozone pollution to between 65 and 70 parts per billion, from the current limit of 75 parts per billion. Ground-level ozone pollution -- better known as smog -- forms from automobile exhaust and emissions from power plants and industrial facilities.Environmental and public health groups are lobbying for the final standard to fall on the lower end of that range, while oil and gas interests don't want to see it lowered at all.And those oil interests are getting an assist from former EPA official Bob Sussman.Sussman, who served as senior policy counsel at the EPA from 2009 to July 2013, is listed as an attendee at a meeting between EPA officials and the oil giant BP on July 24. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, and six other agency staffers attended the meeting.According to a summary of the meeting, BP has asked the agency to adjust the standard to include more exemptions for background levels of ozone pollution. Background levels of ozone can come from things like wildfires, or pollution that originates in other countries.BP argued that consideration of such background levels is putting an undue burden on some regions of the country. In issuing its proposal last year, EPA argued that the background levels aren't a major problem in most parts of the U.S., and described the various mechanisms in place under the Clean Air Act that already that allow for exemptions.Reached for comment, Sussman confirmed that he works for a number of clients, including BP, but said that he does not comment on specific projects and declined to discuss it further. Sussman now has his own consulting firm and is listed as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law.A BP spokesman also told The Huffington Post that Sussman is \"among the outside consultants BP works with to accomplish its business objectives.\" The BP spokesman said that while they discussed background ozone levels in the meeting, they \"did not discuss the appropriate level of the ozone standard.\"But BP is also working through the American Petroleum Institute on the ozone issue, the spokesman confirmed. And API has taken the position that new standards \"are not justified from a health perspective because the science is simply not showing a need to reduce ozone levels.\"The EPA's scientific advisory board, however, has advocated for lowering the standard, noting that a lower standard would yield more health protections, particularly for vulnerable groups like children, the elderly and people with lung conditions.The fight over the ozone standard has dragged on for years. The Bush EPA proposed setting the standard at 75 parts per billion in March 2008, which was notably higher than the scientific advisory board recommended. A group of environmental and public health groups, along with 11 state attorneys general, filed suit to block standards they said were too weak.The Obama administration revisited the standards shortly after taking office, releasing a draft proposal in January 2010 that called for lowering the limit to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. But the final rules were repeatedly delayed, and in September 2011 Obama himself directed the EPA to withdraw the proposal as part of an effort to reduce regulatory burdens.Environmental and public health groups sued again, and last year a federal judge gave EPA an October 2015 deadline for finalizing the rules. The EPA issued draft rules in November 2014 that proposed lowering the limit to 65 to 70 parts per billion.Sussman should have a good sense of how the standards would work -- he was working at the EPA when the agency first proposed the tougher standard in 2010, and according to news reports from the time, was involved in the decision-making process. The American Petroleum Institute made a presentation to Sussman at the time that focused on the background ozone issue.An EPA spokeswoman declined to comment.But others are pointing to Sussman's new role working with BP to weaken the standards as evidence of the revolving door of Washington. Sussman also worked as a deputy administrator in the Clinton administration EPA. After leaving the Clinton administration, he was a registered lobbyist for the firm Latham & Watkins. In 2008 he was named to Obama's transition team and then joined the EPA as a senior policy counsel.\"It's really troubling to see an issue [Sussman] was deeply involved in, and then have [him] come back and petition the agency on those same issues,\" said a representative of a nonprofit group advocating to lower the ozone standard, talking on background in order to speak more freely.He called the BP position \"particularly cynical because the oil industry creates a lot of upwind pollution,\" and said that changing how the standard deals with background ozone is just as dangerous to public health as a higher overall limit. \"If you create a situation where you weaken the standard by removing days where dirty air is threatening the health of the public, it gets you to a similar place -- less health protection for the public,\" he said. \"It's not the frontal assault, but a surgical attempt to undermine the standard.\"Others were happy to criticize the situation on the record. \"It truly is mind-boggling that he would go consult for a big oil company that obviously fears any air quality limits on fracking operations,\" said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, calling oil companies the \"ring leaders\" in efforts to block a tougher standard.EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has said the agency will release the final proposal by the Oct. 1 deadline."}, {"title": "The Huffington Post Is Hiring A Green Editor", "text": "Location: Washington, D.C. or New York City Position Type: Full TimeAbout the Role:The Huffington Post is seeking an editor to coordinate our Green coverage.

The transition, which will take 10 years to complete, comes as McDonald's plans to serve breakfast all day long, likely increasing its use of eggs.Though cage-free eggs are more expensive, a McDonald's spokeswoman told The Huffington Post that menu prices will not rise.\"Our customers are increasingly interested in knowing more about their food and where it comes from,\" McDonald's USA President Mike Andres said in a statement. \"Our decision to source only cage-free eggs reinforces the focus we place on food quality and our menu to meet and exceed our customers' expectations.\"The company has struggled over the last two years with declining sales as smaller rivals such as Chipotle -- the fast-food industry poster-child for more natural, high-quality ingredients -- have devoured market share.To regain some ground, McDonald's vowed in March to nix some of the antibiotics fed to chickens raised for meat. McDonald's birds are still fed ionophores, a form of veterinarian antibiotic given to flocks that catch diseases or parasites. Chipotle, which does not use meat from chickens that have been fed antibiotics, said the burger chain won't be \"truly antibiotic-free\" until it stops using meat treated with ionophores.Birds used in chicken nuggets and patties are already raised in barns, according to McDonald's spokeswoman Becca Hary. That means egg-laying hens could still be subject to the same overcrowded housing conditions that breed illnesses requiring treatment via ionophores. Cage-free, as has been well-documented by animal rights advocates, is not synonymous with cruelty-free.McDonald's said it has yet to suss out how to keep its supply chain humane, even once the company has switched over to cage-free eggs.\"Working in collaboration with our suppliers and industry experts, standards will be defined,\" Hary told HuffPost in an email on Wednesday. \"McDonald's is transitioning to what is called a cage-free aviary system, which is a hen housing system where the hens roam freely through an open bar or section of a barn with multiple tiers and floor access.\"Still, the sheer size and scope of McDonald's business makes even incremental moves toward more sustainable, humane animal husbandry impactful. Animal rights advocates praised Wednesday's announcement as historic.\"This is a watershed moment in a decades-long effort to eliminate the cruelest confinement from our food supply,\" Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement. \"McDonald's admirable move makes clear that egg production's future is cage-free.\"McDonald's joins a cadre of major chains that have vowed to go cage-free. Nestlé and Starbucks unveiled plans last year to phase out eggs from caged hens. Over the last five years, Burger King, food supplier Aramark and Hellmann's mayonnaise maker Unilever transitioned to cage-free eggs. In May, Walmart -- one of the world's biggest retailers -- committed to treating animals more humanely.\"My hope is that McDonald's move will serve as an impetus for other restaurant chains and companies in the U.S.,\" Sonia Faruqi, author of the factory-farm book Project Animal Farm, told HuffPost. \"It will be an indication that ethics can play a part in -- and not stand in contradiction to -- good business.\""}, {"title": "Adorable Pink Dolphin Is Like A Real-Life Pokemon", "text": "Meet what just might be the world's cutest dolphin.\"Pinky,\" as she's being called, is a rare pink dolphin -- and a Pokemon lookalike -- spotted in Louisiana waters.First seen in 2007 as a pup swimming alongside her mother in the Calcasieu River, she was recently spotted again by Capt.

This was addressed to CleanFish, as we are in the midst of a marketplace that looks to us for authenticity in sustainable seafood issues. So, the question to us, as I understood it, was, \"Is MSC for real?\" Yes, MSC is for real, and the intention of those who I know in leadership positions of MSC is to promote a positive impact on wild ocean fishing and fishery practices for the better. In this effort MSC has made a real difference that is quite positive. And, in this case, a recent newsletter penned by my co-founder did the research to make clear that MSC is absolutely in the right in calling this Antarctic krill fishery sustainably managed...for now.Still, the point is not to see the MSC seal on a product and go brain dead into blind acceptance. The MSC seal, and that of any 'green certifier', is to provide a snapshot of information and guidance. That is all it can do. The global food chains that our mainstream industrial food system presents to us is so very complex, often incredibly fragmented, and very hard to follow. And, what is also true is that there is, more often than I am comfortable with regarding these certifying agencies, a good deal of money involved.We have let this happen. We, the consumers, have for the past three decades indicated, perhaps unwittingly, that we value no brainer convenience over a more thoughtful connection to the sources of our food. That lack of connection for the easy convenience of our food has been costly in terms of food security and in terms of our health.Politicians have often played fast and loose with the funding for the government agencies responsible for overseeing the security and safety of our food. The FDA and the USDA have very diminished staff resources to do the job of really checking on foods coming to us from all over the world. This is a risky business. Candidly we are fortunate that we have so few food scares in this country. When you review the scale of goods and the numbers of food security inspectors and officials, how could this be otherwise? The lack of consumer safety overview is rather legendary in the matter of drugs, of herbs, and of substances you cannot pronounce that end up in foods lining the shelves in too many of our food markets.The related problems resulting from the truly troubling multiplication of certification entities is who is paying them? And with what sometimes rather confusing agendas? As with our upcoming political season, the media and the campaign ad agencies are geared up for information overloading enough to make the eyes glaze and the mind go into victimized numbing states. Half-truths and false statements if made often enough start to sound solid. Often the certifying agencies that seem to multiply with each season fall into this trap as well.We need take back our responsibility in all this. We live in an information age. We need to know more about what we are eating. We need to take back our responsibility as citizens to know about the sources and systems that affect our safety and security. We need to question any systems that are less than transparent, whether it is about GMO's in our food or the flow of money to the elected representatives in our politics.As we are talking about our choices in a political season, we are present to discussions about future systemic policies that determine our economics, our education, our healthcare, and our food. While these issues come through television, it is not hard to mistake them for entertainment spots issuing sound bites. We need to know more about what really benefits us and which people or set of policies truly shares our values. Our future is at stake, whether that vote is a vote with our ballot for a person, or a vote with our fork for those sources that are generating our next meal.Your vote always, and in all ways, matters."}, {"title": "California Climate Change Bills Face Tough Passage", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California lawmakers negotiated frantically behind the scenes on Tuesday over the fate of several proposals to dramatically reduce the state's use of fossil fuels and slash the amount of greenhouse gases that legally could be emitted.The measures, part of an environmental agenda championed by state Senate Democratic Leader Kevin De Leon, aim to require public utilities in California to use renewable resources for half the energy they provide by 2030, and mandate a 50 percent cut in the use of petroleum in cars and trucks by the same year.Another bill would mandate an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from levels emitted in 1990.The proposals, contained in two bills that must be passed by Friday night or die, won passage in the liberal state Senate but have met opposition from moderate Democrats in the Assembly.Equally controversial is a proposal floated last week by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown that drivers pay $65 per year in additional fees to help pay for road repairs in the state.That idea, discussed with Republican lawmakers who strongly oppose a fee but whose votes would be needed, has not yet been formally written into a bill.The various proposals have prompted opposition from oil companies and others.\"This law will limit how often we can drive our own cars,\" says a Western States Petroleum Association ad in opposition to De Leon's bill to cut gas and diesel use. It warns of a future in which the state will monitor how far people drive, and fine them for using too much gas. Other ads warn of gasoline rationing.De Leon, who like other lawmakers would not talk about the proposals on Tuesday while sensitive negotiations were taking place, has said his proposal would not ration gasoline or monitor people in their cars.The deadline for bills passing the legislature's regular session is Friday night.

As Chait notes, the planet just experienced its hottest month ever and sea levels are rising three times faster than previously estimated.American political leaders and climate-change denialism have also made it difficult for the US to make meaningful progress on the issue -- for instance, by passing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.There is other encouraging news to report, though, and Chait is feeling optimistic.“Even if all the Paris talks do is simply eliminate the risk of the all-too-thinkable worst-case scenario, it would constitute a monumental achievement in the history of human civilization, like the development of modern medicine,” Chait writes.The price of solar power has fallen dramatically in recent years, from almost $10 per watt two decades ago to 50 cents per watt today -- some estimated the price wouldn't dip below 50 cents for another 15 years. Today, a new solar power plant is cheaper to build in sunny places than a coal or natural gas plant, and the same will soon be true in places that receive an average amount of sunlight.Wind power, too, is getting cheaper; new energy-efficient technologies are being developed at a rapid pace; and new regulations mean that no new coal plants will ever be built in the US.Impressive action on climate change is being made in some unexpected places as well.In China, which leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions, coal consumption and production have declined as the country has invested in renewable energy, dramatically increasing its solar capacity and wind energy production in recent years. China’s action could arguably set a powerful example for other developing nations.MORE:Grist: Farming Flicks Help Teach Agriculture Skills Where They’re Really NeededNew York Times: For Teens in Crisis, the Next Text Could Be a LifesaverThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

Acknowledging there will be   climate deniers within that group -- Presidential candidate Rick Santorum tried to make the argument just this week on Bill Maher's Real Time -- that's more than a third of the world's population. A statement from Hindu leaders is expected soon; Buddhist are planning to update their 2009 climate statement; and a week ago, 409 Rabbis signed a Rabbinic letter on the Climate Crisis.Another tipping point is reached, and so I believe that just like other climate issues that hit their breaking point -- the hole in the ozone, acid rain in the U.S., air pollution in Los Angeles -- global warming can be mitigated, if not reversed.But there is a growing recognition that global warming or climate change is only one symptom of a much bigger mess. With the Catholic and Islamic declarations, what was once a radical demand for solutions to environmental woes has become a mainstream, clarion call for a reinvention of society. Pope Francis in his August Encyclical on \"Care for Our Common Home\" names this \"the ethical, cultural and spiritual crisis of modernity\" caused by an inaccurate world view:\"When human beings place themselves at the centre, they give absolute priority to immediate convenience and all else becomes relative.\"The Islamic Declaration agrees:\"We have now become a force dominating nature...and the cause of such corruption and devastation on it that we are in danger of ending life as we know it on our planet.\"Both documents acknowledge that the natural resources of our \"common home\" are limited and that infinite growth is simply not possible. And both speak of the need for humility.Bill McKibben, putative leader of the climate movement, eloquently summarizes the Pope's diagnosis in The New York Review of Books:The ecological problems we face are not, in their origin, technological,' says Francis. Instead, 'a certain way of understanding human life and activity has gone awry, to the serious detriment of the world around us.' He is no Luddite ('who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper?') but he insists that we have succumbed to a 'technocratic paradigm,' which leads us to believe that 'every increase in power means an increase of \"progress\" itself...as if reality, goodness and truth automatically flow from technological and economic power as such.' This paradigm 'exalts the concept of a subject who, using logical and rational procedures, progressively approaches and gains control over an external object.'What both edicts demand is a revolution as dramatic as Copernicus placing the sun instead of the earth at the center of the solar system. Just as that relatively narrow change to mathematical models exploded the era's established ideology, questioning church dominance and a ruling class designated by Divine Right, so climate change must remove humans as the dominating force over the natural world and causes us to question the social value of those who own and manage our primary institutions, business and government.As for the role humility must play in addressing climate change, the success of necessary government reinvention demands it. The founding of America was based on humility as \"the indispensable virtue for greatness\" David J. Bobb wrote in Fast Company. Likewise with business, and leadership guru Jim Collins agrees. His Harvard Business Review article \"Level 5 leadership: The Triumph of Humility and Fierce Resolve\" identifies humility as key to creating a sustainable business success: nowhere will the ability to admit failure and change course be more important than in dealing with climate change.Evidence that our arrogant control-and-confront leadership has failed is ubiquitous, from extreme heat and severe water shortages here in the U.S. to the virtual death of the ecological infrastructure in China, where political corruption has created a Communist-Capitalist apocalypse in which natural resources are depleted or despoiled and virtually all species including humans are sickened or killed.The world's great religions insist that our secular leaders must either adapt to the new reality or be replaced.

Credit: Clean Energy Collective.Rooftop solar is growing quickly. In the U.S., 1.2GW of residential solar was installed in 2014 and installs in Q1 of 2015 increased 76 percent over the same quarter in the prior year. In fact, so far this year, residential solar has added more capacity than the natural gas industry has.But, the growth potential in residential solar has a natural cap: according to the US Department of Energy, about 50 percent of all rooftops can't use solar panels. Some are too shady, others are pitched at too acute an angle or house equipment that hampers installation. Many families don't own their home or live in multi-unit buildings and don't have the right to install panels on the rooftop. Still others can't afford it or are unable to secure financing. Taken together, some industry experts estimate that fewer than 20 percent of all households can add solar to their roofs.This is a significant obstacle to the continued development of the residential solar market.One increasingly attractive way to grow the market is the community solar garden, an offsite facility that provides power to multiple customers. Solar gardens can effectively make residential solar available to everyone by allowing customers without rooftop space to become renewable customers.Community solar gardens provide important efficiencies by reducing the need for site-specific mapping and installation and by spreading the soft costs associated with permitting and interconnects. Garden power can be sold in variable units, making it affordable. And, by untethering generation from a customer's home, the benefits of renewable power move with the customer.Community solar is still only a small part of the solar power mix. Last year, 21 MW of community solar were installed, and by the end of this year, industry experts estimate that 180 MW will be built. In addition, these are generally small projects, the vast majority under 75 MW. At that level, they aren't very profitable and it is often cost prohibitive to monetize tax credits that might be available for the project.But, developing community solar projects at scale is still not as easy as it should be.First, investors are still unfamiliar with, and cautious about, the asset class. There is not yet much data on customer acquisition costs or much standardization around customer contracts or billing infrastructure.Second, community solar gardens still largely rely on a patchwork of supportive state policies. In Massachusetts, participants get net metering credits for off-site community arrays. Minnesota runs an uncapped program through its local utility. But, most states have nothing.Regulatory uncertainty is also a barrier. While community solar gardens can sometimes be structured to take advantage of the commercial investment tax credit, there is insufficient clarity around whether gardens are eligible for residential tax credits. There is also ongoing discussion around whether an interest in a community solar project could be considered a \"security\", in which case, companies raising capital for community solar projects would face additional regulation.Despite these obstacles, the market potential is enormous. GTM Research estimates that the market for community solar will grow 500% this year and projects compound annual growth of 59 percent over the next five years.Not surprisingly, start-up companies have taken the lead. Clean Energy Collective and SunShare, the two \"biggest\" players in the space, together account for almost a third of all operating community solar capacity in the US today.But, large vertically integrated companies are beginning to enter the market. NRG Energy recently launched a community garden serving 200 homes in Freetown, Massachusetts and has announced a 100 MW shared solar pipeline, and Solar City is developing pilot gardens.The public sector has taken some early steps to support shared solar power generation. In July, President Obama announced over $500 million in commitments from investors, states and cities to provide community solar for low-income households. Vermont is making it easier for developers to build solar gardens by developing standard community solar net metering agreements for public energy buyers. New York State recently announced new efforts to support community solar through its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) program.To scale -- to reach the 80 percent of households where rooftop solar is not an option -- we need to expand and simplify the rules around building community solar and selling to customers. States should drop the caps on capacity and increase the size of allowable projects. The SEC needs to resolve the securities sales issue. Most important, developers need to appreciate the unique role the utilities play with consumers and the utilities need to develop business cultures which see their customers as their partners and not their adversaries, and don't see new sources of power production as a threat. The faster we help this happen, the faster residential solar will grow."}, {"title": "'Overburden': Powerful New Film Doc Captures Big Coal's Enduring Trauma -- And Two Women's Work to Heal Its Damage", "text": "While recent headlines hastily declare the death of King Coal, a powerful new film documentary based on seven years of investigation poignantly captures the complexities and largely overlooked stories of the enduring trauma of the coal industry on miners, their families, affected neighbors and the ravaged communities and Appalachian mountains they call home.As one of the most timely, poetic and informed film documentaries released this year, Overburden: Two Women and the Mountain Between Them, chronicles a quintessential American journey--amid the tragedy of lawlessness in the workplace and the environment--of two courageous women, formerly divided, who shed their fears and find common ground to begin the painful process of dealing with their grief, seeking terms of justice, and healing their damaged communities and mountains.\"We've all become family,\" Betty, a once fervent pro-coal supporter tells Lorelei, a coal miner's widow and vocal mountaintop removal mining organizer, in the film. \"Don Blankenship has put us together,\" she adds, referring to the notorious former Massey Energy CEO. Recognizing the loss of Betty's brother in the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster, as well as her own suffering, Lorelei responds: \"Too high of a price to pay, though.\"As featured in Overburden--a chilling mining term that refers to the overlying rock and soil displaced, like besieged residents and miners, to reach underground coal resources--these two former adversaries will stand together when Blankenship finally goes on trial on Oct. 1 in Charleston, West Virginia, for charges of conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards relating to the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, which took 29 lives.To be sure, Lorelei and Betty will not only stand together in solidarity for mine safety and economic diversification.\"There's a desperate need for healing in the community,\" Lorelei says, in one of the most poignant moments in the film, as she packs up her belongings to move away.Healing between families, communities and the plundered mountains in central Appalachia -- and in so many other strip-mined communities in southern Illinois, Wyoming and Montana, and on Northern Cheyenne, Crow, Navajo and other indigenous lands.Embedded for years in West Virginia, Overburden director and University of North Carolina professor Chad Stevens is not only one of the most talented filmmakers of his generation, but one of its best storytellers, who has done the tedious and indefatigable work behind the scenes to gain the trust of bitterly divided and traumatized communities, and allow his characters to speak for themselves and recount the process of such healing unfolding today. Stevens brilliantly balances the beauty of families and the mountains, amid the tension of its conflicts and demise; his footage of a bear cub, aimlessly wandering to the edge of a massive strip mine, in search of its mother, is singular in its power.There are a lot of important film documentaries on mountaintop removal mining--a strip mining process that has literally detonated untold millions of tons of explosives to blow up the tops of more than 500 mountains and shovel up the coal with machines over the past half century. In the tradition of the Oscar-winning film documentary Harlan County, Stevens effectively transcends the \"war on coal\" political banter by capturing the human stories behind the daily operations of one of our nation's most misunderstood, complicated and devastating sources of energy.Photo credit: Chad Stevens, courtesy of Overburden film.The portrait of Lorelei dispels many of the stereotypes of so-called \"tree huggers\" working to hold the coal industry and its sycophantic politicians accountable to various water and mining regulations. The widow of a miner who died from black lung disease, with a son-in-law in the mines, Lorelei joins a young community organizer, Rory McIlmoil, in a Coal River Mountain campaign for wind energy in an effort to draw attention for more sustainable economic development in the region. When a mining company launches its strip mining operations on Coal River Mountain, Lorelei travels to Washington as a representative of the affected residents, appealing to the Obama administration's \"power to intervene.\"Taking the viewer on a rare glimpse into the pro-coal circles, Betty is a matter-of-fact narrator who declares \"coal is life here,\" and proudly posts a \"Friends of Coal\" sign. When the violation-ridden Upper Big Branch mine explodes in 2010, taking her brother's life in the process, Betty comes to the realization that \"Massey Energy murdered my brother.\"Joining efforts with Lorelei in a campaign to revoke Massey's corporate charter, Betty sums up the reality of both miners and all communities affected by reckless mining: \"If we don't stand up and fight, who's going to?\"Years in the making, Overburden is ultimately an extraordinary story of transformation; of two brave women who recognize their fates no longer need to be divided by outside forces that have controlled the region for over a century through fear, deprivation and outright violence, and take action for a more viable future.With Blankenship's historic indictment -- the first coal baron to be brought to trial for conspiracy charges in decades -- Overburden should be required viewing for President Obama, the Congress, and anyone who has ever depended on coal-fired electricity."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Drought Refugees, Solar Keeps Surging, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.Beautiful Tropical Gem - toucans live in tropical forests, and will disappear with them.Forests: the cheapest way to store carbonOO Earth To Lose An India-Sized Chunk Of Its Tropical Forests By 2050 - new research suggests that tropical forests may be disappearing even faster than we thought.Related Headline:Keeping It Green: Gabon is working to balance competing demands of retaining biodiversity and mitigating climate change with the immediate needs of its people.

A test project off the shores of Oahu, Hawaii is using a special buoy to collect wave power and turn it into electricity. While the idea isn't new, this is the first time that such a buoy has been connected to the grid and is actually producing usable power.The buoy, named Azura, absorbs wave energy from both up-and-down and side-to-side motion, the first design of its kind. Right now, it's producing just 20 kilowatts, which seems a bit weak given its 45-ton size, but if the tests are deemed successful and commercial buoys follow, they may be able to generate between 500 kilowatts and 1 megawatt, according to Northwest Energy Innovations, which has parked the buoy at the U.S. Navy's Wave Energy Test Site in Kaneohe Bay at a depth of 100 feet.The Azura buoy's \"PowerPod\" converts the heave and surge motion of waves into electricity. (Source: Northwest Energy Innovations)After earlier tests in New Zealand and Oregon, Azura is getting serious scrutiny now for its ability to capture wave energy in 360 degrees, collecting power from both the heave (vertical) and surge (horizontal) motions of a wave. It includes an onboard generator that converts kinetic wave motion to electricity, which is then transferred to land through an undersea cable. \"As the first grid connected wave energy device in the U.S. that will be tested and validated by an independent party, this deployment marks a major milestone for our team and the marine renewable energy industry,\" Northwest Energy Innovations founder and CEO Steve Kopf said in a statement.In contrast, other wave energy buoys, such as Aquamarine Power's Oyster design in Scotland, sit almost entirely underwater and pitch backward and forward in waves near the shore. The movement of flaps drives hydraulic pistons that push water under pressure through a pipeline to drive an onshore hydroelectric turbine that can deliver 800 kW.The Oyster wave power device creates clean sustainable electricity from ocean wave energy. (Source: Aquamarine Power)Hawaii would make a great customer for Azura. Heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels for power generation, the state has the nation's highest electricity rates, a sad irony given the opportunities on the islands for solar, wind, and other forms of alternative energy. But that may change within a few decades. In June, Governor David Ige signed legislation setting a goal for Hawaii to generate all its electricity from renewable sources by 2045. \"As the most oil-dependent state in the nation, Hawaii spends roughly $5 billion a year on foreign oil to meet its energy needs. Making the transition to renewable, indigenous resources for power generation will allow us to keep more of that money at home, thereby improving our economy, environment and energy security,\" Ige said in a statement.In fact, Hawaii has already shown leadership. It has the highest penetration of rooftop solar installations in the nation, and as of April, had almost 3,000 pending installation applications on Oahu alone -- according to Hawaiian Electric, which has struggled in the past to integrate solar-sourced energy into its grid at the speed its consumers demand.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed.Don Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites."}, {"title": "Deadly Sandstorm Brings Life And War To A Halt In The Middle East", "text": "Thick yellow dust blew into Middle Eastern capitals from the east on Tuesday, putting life -- and war -- briefly on pause.The massive sandstorm started in Iraq and also blanketed parts of Syria, Turkey, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories on Tuesday.Health authorities in several countries warned people not to leave their homes, and schools closed in Jordan and Lebanon.

If you haven't seen it, set aside an evening very soon, get the movie on Netflix, pop some popcorn, and gather the kids around--yes, even the kids. The movie is that good.There was a time when talking about dam removal was something that mainstream conservationists would do only behind closed doors. It seemed too big, too \"out there.\"But as economics, science, and data have overwhelmingly shown us recently, there are a lot of dams that are obsolete today, and yes, even harmful. Harmful not just to fish, but to species such as orca, who rely on salmon, and to humans, who have lost whole fishing communities, and to the businesses built around the fishing communities, and to tribes that lost parts of their culture -- all hurt by dams. Guess how many dams there are in the United States? Seriously, don't Google it; guess. No, it's higher than that. (Keep reading.)Hands down, salmon are the lifeblood of Northwest ecosystems. When salmon are free to do their thing--to swim from the upper reaches of our Western mountains out to the deep ocean (some reaching Japan), and then to come all the way back to start the next generations that will keep repeating the journey--they're not just saving themselves, they're helping us all.The one most important thing that we can do to set them free, free to provide this incredible, abundant resource for us and for the creatures with whom we share this planet, is to take down some dams that no longer serve our communities. And with well over 75,000 dams across America, there are a good number that fall into that category.Sounds radical? It's already being done with great success and great results. It's radically rational.Our National Park Service recently oversaw the biggest dam removal project in history. Beginning in 2011, the Park Service began removing the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Elwa River in Washington's Olympic National Park. These dams had shut off all but the lower five miles of river to spawning salmon. Now the waters flow freely from the Olympic Mountains headwaters all the way out to the ocean.Imagine all that rock and earth that the river slowly weathered away. It became trapped behind the dams for decades. As those building blocks of nature -- the sand and dirt -- tumbled past the remnants of the dams, acres of new beaches and estuary habitats were created seemingly overnight. And species came swimming, crawling, and slithering back.Their ancestors hadn't been above these dams in more than ten generations. Yet in September 2014, three confirmed adult Chinook salmon were spotted above the site of the blasted-away dams. It was the first return of the Chinook in 102 years.Without the dams, salmon have come home. They're getting 70 miles of their habitat back. Historically, when Chinook reached their full-size potential, they were 100 pounds or more--bigger than a German shepherd.The Elwha River dam removal shows us what is possible. But the removal of the four lower Snake dams is the Holy Grail. Removing these dams would mean we could restore the largest remaining potential salmon habitat in the lower 48 states.The Snake River dams are not just holding back a lot of sediment, they're holding back salmon, orcas, and humans. They're holding back the full glory of the Pacific Northwest. Imagine the richness of the ecosystems, the health of the oceans, the diversity of the species, the progress of the communities, and the return of the cultures that will all be revived in one fell swoop--or more accurately four fell swoops. Let's make it happen.Want to make a difference?

I demur, admitting only to owning a boat. I have too much awareness of and respect for real sailors to compare my level of skill. Like many mariners, I get seasick, unless the seas are calm or I am sufficiently infused with mint and ginger. But the susceptibility is always there, the memory of past unpleasant incidents, the anticipation, both physical and psychological, of what is to come, and the thing itself -- nauseating, exhausting, humiliating, just plain awful, until it's over and you've found your sea legs again.Sickness at sea is as old as seafaring itself, sailors subject to wind, sun, heat, cold, dehydration, poor food, and all the rest. We know the tales of scurvy and such; sometimes, when we look more closely, we can sense another disease -- that of loneliness, melancholy, depression, the mental illness that can result from extreme physical and psychological circumstance -- until it too is over, in the best case with a successful homecoming and revival.The world ocean is a sick sea. I have never been so definitive before, always the optimist thinking we are not yet there. But the symptoms are no longer deniable, the evidence mounts daily in nauseating waves of reported spills and leaks, dying reefs, depleted fisheries, vast areas so oxygen-deprived that nothing lives. Like mint and ginger, I keep looking for the good news, the growing number of marine protected areas, small victories over the extraction interests, some policy or regulation that draws a line, some triumph by a local coastal community or small island state standing up to protect itself from the sickness.The thinking once was that the ocean by its vastness would dilute these things, would heal itself. But we are beyond that now, holding on to that homily only as a desperate belief or a cynical justification for permitting the practices that have created the disease itself. What will it take for us to realize that we are the attacking, consuming microbes and that to counter seasickness we must first heal ourselves?I read recently the phrase \"sea blindness,\" referring at some historical moment to public unawareness of the ocean's relevance and relationship to what takes place on land. Yes, there is shipping and trade and warfare, and yes, there is fishing and food production, but true insight and awareness remains dim, clouded by fog on the horizon, or distance from where one lives, or immediacy of these ocean manifestations directly on our daily life. If we can't \"see\" it, or feel it, then we can't really do anything about it.We should be frustrated and furious. We should feel the nauseating, exhausting, humiliating reality of what is happening to our ocean. We should be outraged by governance that delays and prolongs any policy, regulation, or action directed toward sustaining this essential natural environment. We should be aware that today in the United States, Europe, the Pacific, the Arctic, indeed everywhere in this ocean world, even the progress we have made is under attack by forces of greed, dilution, revision, and retraction of anything that interferes with the exploitation or corruption of the ocean until we are left with only a toxic sea.What will it take?There are thousands of ocean advocates, policy makers, scientists, communicators, organizers, and individuals out there, all over the world, fighting to keep our ocean safe. Hats off! I hope you can honor, respect, support, and engage with them wherever you may be. Join them and build their number exponentially.But my sense is that this medicine is not working, is not yet big enough, strong enough, even smart enough to do what must be done. We are advocating for the ocean with best intentions and hope. We want to get beyond sea sickness to that sustainable place, purged, free, secure. We know what must be done; at every level, locally, regionally, nationally, internationally, we have plans and policies and agreements in place to free us of this disease. We know what must be done, but we are not yet aware enough, mad enough, or desperate enough to do enough about it.We are talking about survival here. Every human need for the future -- fresh water, food, energy, medicine, security, and psychological renewal -- is dependent on a healthy, sustainable world ocean. The ocean is our cure. Why would we destroy it?"}, {"title": "Navajo Woman Trucks Water 75 Miles A Day To People On Parched Reservation", "text": "The \"water lady's\" big yellow truck is a refreshing sight at the Navajo Nation.Darlene Arviso, known as \"the water lady,\" delivers water five days a week to communities without plumbing and clean water on the Navajo reservation surrounding Thoreau, New Mexico, Navajo Times reported. She totes over 3,000 gallons of water in her truck, traveling 75 miles and visiting about a dozen families every day.“I enjoy my job,” Arviso told the news site. “I like what I’m doing because I’m helping my people.”Arviso grew up on the water-poor Navajo reservation, where about one-third of the 50,000 households are without clean water, the New York Times reported, with a recent drought only furthering the problem. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the average American uses 80-100 gallons of water a day, whereas, Navajo families survive on just 7 gallons. Most families have to travel far distances to get clean water, but do not have the means nor transportation, so Arviso delivers it directly to them.The \"water lady\" visits about 250 homes a month, NPR reported, in a truck owned by the St. Bonaventure Indian Mission, which has provided families in the area with water for about three decades. Using water from an on-site well at the Mission, Arviso loads up the truck and then fills whatever families have to hold the precious liquid, including buckets, jars, barrels or used plastic bottles.The simple resource feels like a gift to many.\"You know what we do? 'The water truck's coming! Get the buckets ready!'” Navajo member Georgianna Johnson said to NPR. “We get all happy. Today's the day I'm going to take a bath.”A nonprofit called DigDeep Water is currently helping the St. Bonaventure Indian Mission build a $500,000 well to help Arviso reach more families, CBS News reported. But the project, being funded exclusively off donations, will take time, and the Navajo Nation still needs the \"water lady,\" who is both a provider and a friend to the people she serves.“If I’m not here, who’s going to bring these people their water?” Arviso told The New York Times. \"Right now, I’m all they’ve got.”Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Puppy Raisers Needed by Canine Companions for Independence", "text": "Canine Companions for Independence is an extraordinary organization that provides highly trained service dogs free of charge to children and adults with disabilities.They recently gave Lysander, a two year old Labrador retriever, to a Norwalk resident, eight-year-old Merrill Moccia, who has Asperger's Syndrome.

The dog represents a huge social bridge for her among her peers.Lysander has been trained to respond to more than 50 commands, including turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors and retrieving dropped objects. One of his most important jobs will be to provide constant companionship for Merrill. Canine Companions also has a great track record of pairing its dogs with servicemen and women.  Behind every one of these great dogs is a puppy raiser, someone who takes the dog into his home at eight weeks of age and gives it up at 18 months to a child or adult with a disability, whose life will be changed for the better.There is an urgent need for puppy raisers. The person must be over the age of 18 or have their parent sign a consent form. Puppy raisers must submit monthly reports, attend obedience classes, and provide financially for the puppy's food, medical and transportation needs. The puppies need daily socialization, so ideally a puppy raiser who is employed full time should ask their employer if the dog can come to the office. At the same time, the puppy needs to know how to behave when left on his own.The dogs are bred by Canine Companions and are either Golden Retrievers or Labradors. In some instances, they are a cross of the two breeds. Katrina Winsor, director of the puppy-raising programs, said: \"Our puppy raisers are incredibly dedicated.

Or drive off a pack of hungry orcas in an attempt to save a baby of a different species?The following two incidents reveal how humpback whales did both of those things, adding a whole new meaning to the phrase \"gentle giants'.Monterey, California - In what is probably the first time such an event has been witnessed and recorded, humpback whales appeared to try to intervene when a pod of killer whales attacked a baby gray whale.Skilled at killing even large whales, this type of orcas regularly take the calves of gray whales - hard as it is to witness, this is a normal predator/prey relationship. But what occurred on May 3rd, 2012 in full view of whale watchers was nothing short of remarkable.​Killer Whale and Humpback Whale: a humpback whale (right) lifts its head out of the water and trumpets loudly toward a male killer whale (left), who is passing just a few feet away. © Alisa Schulman-Janiger/Monterey Bay Whale Watch​  Through the hazy overcast skies, the Monterey Bay Whale Watch boat captain John Mayer on the SeaWolf ll, spotted the whales in the distance and knew something unusual was going on. As the boat drew closer to the scene, whale watchers were stunned by what they saw. A pod of approximately nine transient orcas was in the process of trying to separate a new calf from its mother, but what amazed even the seasoned captain and crew was the presence of two large humpback whales which may have been trying to intervene.Two humpbacks were present throughout the attack, and were joined shortly after the attack ended by five more. © Alisa Schulman-Janiger/Monterey Bay Whale Watch  The mother gray whale struggled valiantly to save her calf, lifting it out of the water to breathe, but she was no match for the coordinated attack as the orcas repeatedly grabbed the fatigued calf and flipped it upside down to prevent it from breathing. During the half hour that the first group of whale watchers observed the contest for survival, the two humpbacks splashed, 'trumpeted', and moved in as close as a body length from the grey whale mother and her calf.At this point, whale researchers Alisa Schulman-Janiger and Nancy Black arrived on the scene in Monterey Bay Whale Watch boat Pt. Sur Clipper, and continued to observe the unusual encounter for nearly seven hours. Shortly after their arrival the baby whale was killed, and the mother took temporary refuge by their boat before heading towards shore.Schulman-Janiger said that first two, then three more humpbacks joined the original pair, and the seven humpbacks \"repeatedly followed the orcas, trumpet blowing, tail slashing, rolling, and head raising. They kept returning to the area of the carcass where the orcas were ripping into the blubber of the dead calf\".A humpback whale follows a subgroup of orcas. This was the most common orientation seen: humpbacks following the orcas (rather than the reverse), sometimes at increased speeds. © Alisa Schulman-Janiger/Monterey Bay Whale Watch  Researcher Nancy Black speculated that these humpback whales may have been protecting the carcass, making it more difficult for the orcas to feed, but without underwater cameras it is difficult to be certain.\"What we do know\", said Schulman-Janiger, \"is that these humpback whales seemed EXTREMELY distressed: nearly every surfacing over the entire observation period was accompanied by trumpet blows. They even put themselves into potential harm's way by diving right next to the gray whale mom - where her calf was under attack\".She noted that humpback whales were known to rescue seals from orcas in the Antarctic, as documented by scientist Robert L. Pitman and John W. Durban referenced the an article in Natural History Magazine:Antarctica:Dr. Lori Marino, senior lecturer in neuroscience at Emory University in Atlanta, is a renowned expert in the cognitive ability of whales and dolphins and she shared her opinion of these remarkable events:This is apparently a case of humpback whales trying to help a member of another species. This shows that they are capable of tremendous behavioral flexibility, giving even more credence to reports of cetaceans coming to the aid of human beings. They seem to have the capacity to generalize from one situation to another and from one kind of being to another. Moreover, they seem to sympathize with members of other species and have the motivation to help.One reason may be that humpback whales, and many other cetaceans, have specialized cells in their brains called Von Economo neurons (\"spindle cells\") and these are shared with humans, great apes, and elephants. The exact function of these elongated neurons is still unknown but they are found in exactly the same locations in all mammal brains for the species that have them.What is intriguing is that these parts of the mammal brain are thought to be responsible for social organization, empathy, speech, intuition about the feelings of others, and rapid \"gut\" reactions. So the presence of these cells is neurological support for the idea that cetaceans are capable of empathy and higher-order thinking and feeling.In either case these whales are apparently demonstrating a high level of sensitivity and concern (morality, if you will) that is laudable in any species."}, {"title": "Quants of Solar", "text": "You might see sunshine, but James Kocher, Project Manager at Locus Energy, sees data. Lots of it. A graduate of the Earth Institute Sustainability Management (MS) program at Columbia University, Kocher recalls the words of his professor, \"Director Steven Cohen would frequently remind us... 'you can't manage what you don't measure' and that is what big data is ultimately going to solve.\" Photovoltaics, what most people still call \"solar panels,\" are gaining market share. In the first quarter of 2015 more than half of all new generation capacity brought online was solar, eclipsing natural gas. As solar power scales up, managing efficiency becomes important. Solar panels can be precisely controlled and monitored akin to a computer network to increase performance. As costs go down, more people adopt. \"With regard to solar, big data is the key to increasing system production,\" Kocher explains.The confluence of sustainability and big data is evident in solar, where new advances have come from the semi-conductor industry. However, because sustainability is often associated with a back-to-nature lifestyle, the general public is often not aware how technical it is. Kocher, for example, became interested in sustainability after working as a volunteer medical technician while still in college. Volunteering reflected a concern for his community and giving back, but it also taught crisis management. \"My shifts on the Ambulance Corp. gave me the confidence to realize that I could evaluate and manage complex and sometimes chaotic situations at an emergency scene.\" Like managing an ambulance corp., navigating a mounting global climate crisis is requiring a technical bent. Corporations and governments find themselves turning to professionals that can oversee and optimize complex systems. Such staffing is often drawing on people with backgrounds that may have intersected with Silicon Valley but, at some point, changed direction toward sustainability and environmental science. You might've met Kocher years ago at an Apple Genius Bar. Troubleshooting hardware and software soon lead him to Apple Store inventory management where greener shipping, packaging, and supply chains is a growing concern.His interest in this area lead him to return to school at the Earth Institute where his study included modeling complex systems. After a few years at Mars, where some of his work revolved around the design and implementation of more sustainable packaging, he joined Locus. Kocher's vision of our rapidly expanding solar infrastructure isn't just about peak performance, but economics as well. Precise and accurate streamlining of energy systems also allows for better risk management. Stable investments in solar assets will propel the industry as a whole. Kocher predicts \"securitized loans or bonds accurately priced based on risk using the historical data provided by companies like Locus Energy.\"A decade ago, it might have been easy to imagine a mind like Kocher's ending up on Wall Street. A change in attitude, a dissemination of new technologies, different opportunities, and challenges are creating new applications for analytic talents. A significant difference, however, is Kocher's ambition to solve environmental problems.

Image credit: Washington State Dept. of Natural Resources]Climate negotiators from countries around the world this week wrapped up a key round of discussions in the lead up to the big finale expected this December in Paris. As negotiators walked out the doors of the conference hall in Bonn, Germany, pundits poured over the results to assess the progress of the talks. But perhaps the clearest signal came in form of alarm bells rung in the climate denier camp.CFACT, one of the leading voices in the climate denier camp and famous for outright lies about climate science as well as a complete lack of shame, immediately blasted out a mass email to its supporters at the conclusion of the talks. Lying is what the bad guys do when they can't win on the facts. And true to form, CFACT invented some whoppers about this round of climate talks.One of the key breakthroughs made in Germany last week was a pair of proposals put forward on the issue of loss and damage stemming from climate change. From wildfires in the western U.S. to hurricane storm surge on the eastern seaboard fueled by rising seal levels, the impacts of climate change are hitting home, leaving loss and damage in their wake. It's a global trend, driven by decades of carbon pollution. The poorest developing countries are the most vulnerable. So they are hit the hardest.The U.S. is leading the effort to ensure Paris produces a comprehensive and long-term global climate agreement. And to that end the U.S. used last week's negotiating session to propose a provision addressing the issue of loss and damage for inclusion in the Paris deal. Potential measures under such a deal include helping developing countries with building an early warning system for extreme weather events and creating a displacement coordination facility to deal with those who lose their homes as a result of extreme weather.This U.S. administration has taken a pretty hard line against defining the issue of loss and damage as a matter of liability or compensation. Nevertheless, CFACT claimed exactly the opposite, going into hysterics and hyperventilating about President Obama in its email to supporters - and of course repeating the usual litany of lies that the earth isn't warming and climate change hasn't affected extreme weather.Interestingly the proposal submitted in parallel by developing nations does not push for compensation or liability. In fact, the words liability and compensation don't even appear in their proposal text.Nations from around the world are increasingly converging on an agreement to address climate change. From that movement, it's already clear that the Paris agreement won't solve the problem of global warming all in one go. But at the same time, it's also clear that the deal is shaping up to be a good first step, a good permanent foundation that covers all the bases. You can tell just by the way the climate deniers are calling the alarm and whistling up the attack dogs.Buckle-up your seat belts, folks. The climate deniers have arrived. It's going to be a rocky road through Paris."}, {"title": "New Environmental Justice Tool is Amazing", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released the EJ Screening and Mapping tool -- and it is amazing. Five years in the making, Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator said,\"EJSCREEN has been a valuable resource for EPA to advance our commitment to protect Americans most vulnerable to pollution. I'm excited to share this tool with the public to broaden its impact, build transparency, and foster collaboration with partners working to achieve environmental justice.\"The tool will not only empower what the EPA terms \"stakeholders\" -- such as state governments, educational researchers, and grant writers -- it will be a game changer for grassroots activists at the hyperlocal level.The premise is built on using data gathered from Environmental and Demographic Indicators, which is then overlapped to yield an Environmental Justice Index. The result shows areas of vulnerable populations juxtaposed with hot spots of environmental concerns.Vulnerable populations are defined as residents that have more stress in their lives and less resources to cope with them. An example would be no hospitals in their neighborhood.There are twelve Environmental Indicators. They include air pollution factors such as inhalation of particulate matter and ozone, which leads to cancer, respiratory disease, and neurological damage. Also accounted for are the exposure to lead paint, proximity to traffic, and geographic relationship to hazardous sites.Demographic Indicators are breakdown stats that look at the percentages on low income, minority communities, receipt of high school diploma, language spoken in the household, and population numbers for those under 5-years-old and over 64.Kevin Olp, an Environmental Protection Specialist with the EPA walked me through a primer on the tool. (There is a page devoted to a step-by-step guide.)\"There's a lot of functionality,\" Olp said, \"as well as a learning curve.\" He emphasized that the tool was best at getting an overview of \"conditions on the ground,\" but was clear that it wasn't possible \"to capture everything. \"You have to have a balance between complexity and accessibility,\" Olp pointed out.Aware of the ongoing call for environmental justice, Olp said, \"This is an easy to use tool to identify areas where we [the EPA] can direct benefits and take a closer look in our work.\" He gave the example of pinpointing a \"block group\" shown to be \"linguistically isolated.\" Based on these findings, the EPA would be alerted to the need for \"outreach in translated material.\"I had Olp look at some of the areas that I have written about. \"You can get really granular information by just putting a dot on the map or creating a user defined shape,\" he said.We checked out Salt Lake City, which is in the 80th percentile for ozone when compared on a national level. Then we mapped West Port Arthur, Texas, an environmentally overloaded hot spot that has twice the national poverty level. Olp said, \"More than 50 percent of its residents are African-American and Hispanic, and most of those populations live near many facilities including chemical plants, refineries, and a hazardous waste incinerator.\"Finally, I had Olp draw a 2-mile radius to drill down on Mott Haven in the Bronx, where Fresh Direct is siting a facility at East 132 Street that the community doesn't want. We were able to pinpoint and document overlapping concerns.The section we examined is 95 percent minority. Low income households are at 63 percent (Two times the state average), and for one in five homes -- no one over 14 years of age has English as a first language. The \"traffic proximity and volume\" (cars and trucks) identifies that 450 vehicles pass by the average household daily. For the rest of New York State, the number is 180 vehicles. Particulate Matter Standards are currently set by the EPA at 2.5. For this area, it is at 11.5. The mapping tools make clear that toxic pollution is present.In building the tool, the EPA reached out to leaders in the Environmental Justice space. I wasn't surprised to learn that Dr. Bob Bullard, the \"Father of Environmental Justice,\" had been involved in the process. I contacted him by e-mail to get his thoughts.Bullard responded:\"Kudos to the EPA for sticking with its commitment made to environmental justice leaders in early NEJAC (National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee) meetings way back in the mid-1990s to develop a user-friendly tool to identify EJ 'hot-spot' neighborhoods. It is important to note that the idea of an EJ screening tool came from community leaders. As computer-mapping technology advanced over the years, EPA forged ahead in developing EJSCREEN, which displays environmental and human health risks borne by populations identified by race, national origin, or income. Armed with high-quality data from EJSCREEN, community stakeholders are better able to present their case for action and remedies.\"A four-minute video can be found on YouTube. One of the pointers was a definition of interpreting percentiles (rankings) as opposed to percentages.The EPA has a lot invested in this tool and wants feedback from users as they move to  their next iteration due out Spring 2016.

Literally. According to the Vatican news, the Pope soon embarks on a journey that will bring him to the United States first ( flying to Washington DC from La Habana-Cuba on September 22nd), meeting with President Barack Obama on September 23rd and culminating with his address at the United Nations General Assembly on September 25th.If you had a chance to look at his latest encyclical, you will be surprised to see how well he is predicting the future of the world. International talks are revolving around climate change, renewable energies and a sustainable environment to live in, as also mentioned in the newly Goals of the United Nations ( Sustainable Development Goals, which will be approved at the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and will replace the Millennium Development Goals, for the next 15 years).The new Sustainable Development Goals, United NationsCalling it a \"social teaching\" instead of a \"green manifesto\", Pope Francis's wit to include practical examples of how we can harm less the environment is what makes him practical and realistic. For this- he says- \"dialogue is essential\".The time and moment in history are right. The Pope will address heads of states and governments at the United Nations in September, pushing for faster and effective climate change negotiations for, among the hop topics, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable production and consumption in both personal and business lives, less use of less fossil fuels and more renewable sources of energy ( id est solar power systems, wind and geothermal energy).The Climate Change negotiations will take place in Paris in December at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change CO21 to reach a common agreement on the climate, applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 Degree Celsius. Latest news also report that UN Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon, frustrated by low progress on climate talks, will gather, on September 27th, with President Barack Obama, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, and Chinese leaders to add \"political push\" to reach a global carbon accord.Going back to wise Francis, he understands that \" those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms\"- referring to the wide inequality gap between the rich and the poor- and \"the failure to respond points to the loss of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society founded\".The issues of poverty and inequality connected to climate change are of utmost importance. If it is true that the world is warming up and temperatures are rising, the most affected people by it will be the most vulnerable ones. For example, as Pope Francis explains \"the depletion of fishing reserves especially hurts small fishing communities without the means to replace those resources; water pollution particularly affects the poor who cannot buy bottled water; and rises in the sea level mainly affect impoverished coastal populations who have nowhere else to go\". If we look around us, I am sure we can find many more thousands examples.Fishing in KenyaThe green rhetoric here if of people who \"being located in affluent urban areas\" are far removed from the poor, with little direct contact with their problems. This lack of physical contact and encounter, encourage at times by the disintegration of our cities, can lead to a \"numbing of conscience and to tendentious analyses which neglect parts of reality\".Humanity is strongly connected to Environment. We influence it, in a positive and negative way, and it influences us. The environment is \"il Creato\", the Creation, what surrounds us, and what we should take care of. An ecological crisis is taking place. An \"ecological approach\" is deemed necessary, and it naturally also becomes a \"social approach\". The way we behave, our ethical responsibility, is what makes us live in society and it is the primary sign of caring and giving, with a open eye and a wide view of the people living in the world. (not only our family members, our colleagues and our friends).The light of Hope at the end of his encyclical ( this is what makes Pope Francis so human and spiritual at the same time), sends a positive message on the nature of the human beings. Human beings- he starts-are capable of doing the worst, but are also able to rise above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning\". He also reminds us that \"no system can completely suppress our openness to what is good, true and beautiful, or our God-given ability to respond to his grace at work deep in our hearts\". I very much look forward to receiving your comments on the relationship between climate change, poverty, global inequality and ethical responsibility ( and I would love to receive a comment from the Pope himself!)In the meantime, I welcome you to read the environmental encyclical, fully and freely published by the Vatican, here.Ciao and see you soon!

All five of the fields have been incredibly productive over the past forty years using our area's conventional methods for hay farming--frequent tilling, a corn rotation, chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Our hay was regarded as some of the best in the area. And we produced a lot of it.Then, in 2012, we stopped tilling. We stopped spraying chemicals. We stopped rotating in corn. And, as a result, fields that once produced three cuttings of broad-leafed, green, tall grasses struggled to produce two cuttings of thin, dry, yellowed grass. Our hay production collapsed.Despite that, we stuck to our idealistic guns: no tilling, no chemicals, no corn. And, now, three years later, the grass growth is still dismal in all of our fields...except one.This one field--our eastern-most field--is not struggling to produce grasses. In fact, this particular field is now producing far more than it ever did under conventional management. This field, this year--when all grass production across the northeast is at alarming lows--is producing a fourth-growth of broad-leafed, green-as-can-be, lush, tall grasses. The improvement in this one field has one farmer (me) doing backflips of joy.I attribute this field's booming growth to changes in our management and changes in our thinking.First, I'll address our changes in management. Once we stopped fertilizing the fields, we knew our production would drop. We didn't know, however, how to replace the fertilizer and stimulate growth without chemicals. After much research and YouTubing, we came across the work and writings of Allan Savory, Joel Salatin, Allan Nation, Courtney Smith, and Judith Schwartz. These are the pioneers of regenerative agriculture--a form of farming that respects and harnesses the nuances of nature to produce crops, restore the land, and sequester atmospheric carbon back into the earth.Intrigued though we were, being skeptics, we didn't commit all five fields to the experiment. We gave it a go on one small test patch...and, when that worked, we did it in just one field. Next year, we'll expand again.In a natural system (a.k.a. before fences and highways), our fields would have been frequently visited by roaming packs of herbivores and migratory birds and fowl. So, with much hesitation, we brought in a bunch of grass-loving animals. The grasses, after all, evolved to depend on the animals as much as animals evolved to depend on the grasses.This one eastern field is now home to 60 sheep, 40 turkeys, 100 chickens, and a fat sweetheart of a donkey named Ben--our guard donkey. (See our Instagram account for photos--especially of Ben.)The sheep rotate about the field in a pack, behind mobile fencing. They graze. They fertilize. They aerate the soil. And they trample grass.The chickens and turkeys follow the sheep in the rotation by a few days. They graze. They fertilize. They aerate the soil. They eat bugs. And they also trample grass.After every pass of the sheep and the poultry pens, the soil is shaded, fertilized, aerated--primed for water retention, and microbial, fungal, and algal activity. The grass is well-fertilized and grazed to an optimal height. Everything is primed for rapid regrowth.Every time the grass comes roaring back after the animal activity, it is drinking in the CO2 from the atmosphere. The plant splits the carbon (C) molecule from the carbon dioxide, releases the oxygen (O2), and uses the carbon as the foundational building block for everything else it does: build plant matter, build root systems, build topsoil, and feed the soil's microbial critters. Essentially, the grass is doing the work we sorely need right now--putting the excess atmospheric carbon to work and storing a large percentage of it back in the ground where it will be safely stored for hundreds of years.Well-managed grasses can do this often, and very quickly, making them ideal allies in the campaign to reverse climate change.Our changes in management would not have been possible without changes in our thinking. We stopped thinking our ourselves as hay farmers (growers and harvesters of as much grass as possible) to thinking of ourselves as stewards of the fields (managers and aides to an already-existing natural system). This turned our focus from the grass we were growing to the soil in which it grew. It is a subtle shift of thinking, but it has huge practical implications. Clearly, this shift is yielding results: we're growing more grass than we ever did, improving the nutrient content of our hay, improving the soil for (and productivity of) future hay crops, and sequestering carbon.This type of regenerative agriculture marks the dawn of planetary engineering.You see, we know how much carbon should be in the atmosphere (fellow Vermonter Bill McKibben offers a target of below 350 ppm). And, we know how to stop dumping it into the atmosphere (clean energy, no-till agriculture, etc.). And, we now know how to put it back into the ground...WHILE boosting the productivity of agricultural land AND raising healthy animals and humans. Therefore, we have the nascent knowledge and tools to tackle climate change. We are learning to be stewards of the carbon cycle--regulating the atmosphere of the planet by working with natural systems to move carbon back into the earth. It is now just a matter of doing the work.The global discussion regarding climate change will soon shift: from vague doomsdayism to excited talk for what's possible. Humans are taking another evolutionary step forward and it is exciting to watch. The groundwork is now being laid for the large-scale tools and global strategies that will allow modern humans and nature to live symbiotically. Planetary engineering is starting--to the benefit of us all."}, {"title": "Are Climate VIPs Welcome? The Rationale of Carbon Clubs", "text": "In December 2015 Paris will become this year's stage for a massive, annual diplomatic show: the United Nations Climate Summit. Also known as COP 21, this multilateral global negotiation on no less than the future of life on earth will send a powerful political signal--one way or the other--towards the feasibility of a low carbon society. While much hope still exists, it's no secret that this meeting will have a hard time proving that nearly 200 countries can effectively cooperate to cope with the magnitude of the climate change challenge. The difficulties and the slow pace of the negotiations, especially since 2009 during the Copenhagen Climate Summit (COP 15), have overshadowed some positive news. Without convincing measures to answer the climate question via multilateral means, one old idea keeps coming back to center stage: carbon clubs.  The rationale behind these clubs is simple: do more with less. The plan is that, if no broad international agreement can be reached, or if it is considered little ambitious, countries can manage and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through smaller regional or plurilateral agreements among themselves. Essentially, a voluntary group would join efforts to cutting GHG in order to gain some benefits and share costs. The main expectation is to bring together those actors who are willing to have more ambitious targets in terms of greenhouse gas mitigation under a new legal arrangement, and who are ready to get started now. But how desirable is the promotion of \"carbon VIPs\"?  Carbon club enthusiasts defend the advantages of smaller groups of climate \"doers\" working together outside of the slow-moving UN sphere. This is primarily because these smaller clubs could excel at attracting, more effectively, the much needed private sector and stimulating linkages with existing emissions trading schemes, such as those in the European Union, in California, Ontario and Quebec.So, if you are a carbon VIP, advantages would include price stability; liquidity; market access; increased low-carbon investment; and reputational benefits. The overarching goal is thus to reduce efforts needed and complexity demanded by the multilateral arena when promoting emissions reductions. In addition, these clubs could showcase solutions and function as window shops of successful practices attracting more and more members. In theory, there are reasons to support the establishment of these happy little groups. In practice, at least, two major challenges remain.  The first major polemic against carbon clubs derives from the fear of trade discrimination or \"green protectionism\". Put simply, if a group of countries implements low carbon policies, outsiders fear their economies could suffer from tariffs or other penalties for importing high carbon intensity goods into the carbon club. Indeed, green protectionism is an end run around the multilateral climate negotiations: if powerful economies get together in carbon clubs and begin establishing rules regarding carbon pricing, it will necessarily impact those who are not part of the club, perhaps negatively. Proponents would argue this method is the moral path and ultimately will reduce emissions. Detractors would call it nothing less than economic warfare.While trade sanctions seem an attractive option in the absence of a global authority to regulate global commons, carbon clubs are, by definition, discriminatory. This fact, in particular, clashes with the WTO principle of \"most-favored nation\" (MFN), which means that countries cannot discriminate their trading partners. That is, if you offer a certain favor to a country (i.e. lower custom rates), you must be consistent and offer the same benefit to all other partners. Defenders, however, recall that this argument could be overcome. This is because, at the WTO, there are ways to justify certain discriminatory practices against trade partners. Under the article 20 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), exceptions are allowed if the protection of the environment or health is at stake. This debate is actually long and experts know that bringing a trade dispute at the WTO is more a political decision than a legal one.   In the climate context, accusations of green protectionism gained recent relevance as developed countries began to threaten imposing unilateral trade measures under a climate rationale. Two examples deserve to be recalled. First, the 2009 Waxman-Markey Bill in the US Congress was an attempt to establish climate legislation but the draft bill provoked suspicion among developing countries because of the presumed possibility of border carbon adjustments (BCA). BCAs are trade measures, tariffs for example, that could be applied to balance between the climate efforts done by one country when importing goods from less strict countries--just as described above. Despite the premature death of this bill, the polemic was inevitable and negatively affected the climate talks in Copenhagen (COP 15). A second example worth recalling was the European Union's plan to apply a carbon tax to offset emissions from commercial aviation. Since the bloc had already set emissions standards for intra-EU flights, it wanted international flights to comply as well. But, after powerful resistance from major developing countries including the US, the EU stepped back and exempted international airlines from its ETS regulation until 2016. However, the EU sustains that its regulation is compatible with international law.Beyond fears related to economic competitiveness, another interrelated barrier complicates the case for carbon clubs. Suspicion, lack of legitimacy and transparency are frequent arguments from developing countries, which tend to be the main detractors of such clubs, arguing ultimately that they are unfair. The reality is that the Kyoto Protocol, in the view of many developing countries, already represents a big carbon club. Nevertheless, this club is severely ill (to not say dead), and several countries grieve that little has been done to save this agreement, born and raised in a multilateral family. China and India, for example, are usually the most vocal against the club idea as they condemn, beyond \"green protectionism\", attempts to undermine multilaterally agreed principles, notably the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\" (CBDR-RC). But explaining the relative failure of the Kyoto Protocol is not hard. It suffices to ask: who, in real life, wants to be regulated at the global level? In this sense, the idea that some VIPs would get together to take strategic decisions that, in the end, would affect a large number of actors, who were not invited to the party, is an obvious alternative but a politically hard sell at the international level.  Finally, the fact that the debate over carbon clubs remains on the agenda suggests that they cannot be ignored. Among its plusses and minuses, one thing seems to be consensual among the carbon VIP defenders: the UN, for the moment, is not invited to the carbon club party."}, {"title": "California Takes the Lead on Climate Policy", "text": "With nearly 40 million people, California is our largest state by population and is in many ways the embodiment of the contemporary American Dream. California has long led the nation in environmental policy. Polling data in the state reports deep and broad support for protecting the environment.The original Clean Air Act was written to allow California to maintain more stringent regulations than the rest of the country. California's remarkable economic growth provides evidence that it is possible to regulate the environment while growing the economy. If the best proof of concept is demonstration, California has long demonstrated the importance of a clean environment to sustainable economic growth. And California may soon dramatically lead the nation, if not the world, on climate policy.As Alejandro Lazo reported in the Wall Street Journal last week:Democrats in California, which already has the toughest climate-change rules in the U.S., are pushing to strengthen them drastically, an effort that has spurred business groups to mount an intense opposition campaign. A proposed state law would cut petroleum-fuel use by 50 percent, require utilities to get half their power from renewable sources, and increase energy efficiency in buildings by 50 percent -- all by 2030, using 2016 levels as the starting point. A second measure would mandate an 80 percent reduction in state greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, from 1990 levels.The oil industry has generated the predictable onslaught of negative publicity against the proposed law, which has passed the California state senate but is facing opposition from moderate Democrats in the California assembly. The opposition lobby is arguing that the bill will lead to rationing and limits on driving automobiles. As Adam Nagourney wrote in the New York Times last week:The legislation, Senate Bill 350, leaves it to the state's Air Resources Board to determine how the 50 percent mandate would be met; it does not mention gas rationing or a ban on minivans. It also includes no penalties in case the mandate is missed. Opponents, in defending the warnings about rationing, noted that the bill is short on specifics on how the reduction would be achieved; they said they saw no other way the mandate could be met.The legislation has the strong support of California's visionary and experienced governor, Jerry Brown, and the financial backing of hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer. In recent days, some members of the legislature have discussed modifications of the law to provide greater popular control of the specific measures used to implement it and providing some checks on the power of the Air Resources Board. Oil industry lobbyists are attempting to convince the public that the new law will raise the cost of energy for average Californians but, while California politics can't always be predicted, I think that some version of this bill will be enacted in the near future.California's new climate policies are important because they have the potential to be action-forcing in California and throughout the nation. The laws are well written because they set goals for the near future but allow for flexibility in how the state reaches those goals. The state's energy goals send a clear signal to the business community of the future direction of California's climate rules. Such clarity can guide private investment decisions and increase the probability of large-scale changes in behavior. This was accomplished in California nearly a generation ago in the field of energy efficiency, and today California is the most energy efficient state in America.Paradoxically, it is California's success in energy efficiency that increases the importance of the renewable energy mandate in the new legislation. While other states can achieve significant greenhouse gas reductions through energy efficiency alone, and California can continue to improve its energy efficiency, most of the low hanging fruit from energy efficiency has already been harvested in California. Nevertheless, the new law calls for doubling energy efficiency in California's existing buildings. Once that is achieved, significant additional reductions in greenhouse gases will require far greater use of renewable energy.While current technology could be used to achieve the new climate policy goals, it will be far easier to meet and exceed the new standards if new technologies are developed and implemented. For California, the key will be the rapid development of the electric car. This will require advances in battery technology and widespread investment in the infrastructure of renewable energy and distributed generation of energy. Micro-grids and smart-grids will be needed to modernize the energy system and make it more receptive to renewable energy and more efficient when transmitting energy. State-wide installation and commercialization of electric auto charging stations will also be needed.In a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, Chris Megerian reported that:An analysis from E3, an environmental consulting firm based in San Francisco, said the state could need up to 8 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2030 to help slash carbon pollution as much as [Governor] Brown wants. Right now there are only 142,000 such vehicles on the road, according to the Air Resources Board.California has over 33 million vehicles registered. In order to achieve the goal, the state has a decade and a half to transition about 25 percent of the state's motor vehicle fleet from the internal combustion engine. In my view, this is ambitious, but feasible. The state will need to provide tax incentives and use a variety of other techniques to facilitate this change.Education, government vehicle purchases and discounts on electricity for those charging their autos in the evening will also be needed. While the oil industry will remain unhappy about this, there are a large number of other businesses that will benefit from the transition to a renewable energy economy.California's climate policy experiment is an important and path-breaking effort. California is large enough to build a market for innovative electric grid infrastructure, new battery technology, and for lower priced electric cars. Unless electric vehicles are able to outperform and underprice those powered by internal combustion engines, California will not be able to transition 25 percent of their vehicle market. But if it can bring electric cars to market that are cheaper than traditional cars, the policy innovation they are implementing will be contagious.I am optimistic that California is the right place and this is the right time to implement this new initiative. California's scale, education and research institutions, entrepreneurial culture, political leadership, and tradition of environmental awareness provide all of the ingredients needed for success.Americans have long looked to California for an image of the world to come. Sometimes that future is less than reassuring, but often California embodies the social, political, economic, and cultural trends still emerging in the other 49 states. If California can reach these energy goals, environmentalists will have a living, breathing climate policy model that can be imitated throughout the United States and in the fast growing economies of China and India.While many other sustainability challenges will remain, the tide of climate change will literally be reversed. This will free us to focus on other challenges such as biodiversity, species extinction, and the widespread use of toxic substances throughout our economy. There is a great deal riding on Jerry Brown and California's ambitious climate program."}, {"title": "Obama, Jerry Brown and Climate Change: From the Arctic to the Arabs and the Oil Empire at Home", "text": "\"The trouble with this country is that you can't win an election without the oil bloc, and you can't govern with it.\"President Barack Obama and Governor Jerry Brown have both been pushing the envelope of efforts to bring climate change under control and running up against major ingrown opposition to their efforts.Obama spent most of last week up near and in the Arctic Circle, shining his presidential spotlight on massive climate change there caused by our emission of greenhouse gases. But he ended the week making nice back in Washington with the new king of Saudi Arabia, which is doing its level best to keep us addicted to the oil which fuels its incredible wealth.For his part, Brown is pushing both existing policies and his own new policies in California, presenting America's megastate on the Pacific as the exemplar among advanced industrial societies in transitioning away from the greenhouse era to a greener future. But the old oil empire at home has struck back, imperiling passage of key legislation in the state Assembly with a multi-million dollar campaign of public fear mongering and strategic influence peddling with moderate Democrats.President Barack Obama shined his spotlight on climate change at the top of the world, during a three-day trip to Alaska and the Arctic Circle. The rate of temperature increase in the region over the past half-century has been twice as great as that in the lower 48 states, a ratio that is expected to increase.Brown outlined three major climate moves in his fourth Inaugural Address this past January: Increasing California's renewable share of electric power to 50 percent, doubling California's energy efficiency, and cutting California's petroleum usage in vehicles by half. He can enact these measures by executive order, but he's also making sure with legislation which cannot be overturned by a future governor.Each piece of the new Brown plan has gotten opposition, but it is only the latter, cutting petroleum usage in transportation by half, that appears to be under any serious threat, thanks to a massive campaign by the oil industry of lobbying and advertising. The bill, pushed by state Senate leader Kevin de Leon, easily passed the Senate but is now before the state Assembly, which has been beset by a struggle over the speakership and in which corporate lobbyists have greater sway with more moderate Democrats.Brown and his allies have enlisted some high-profile lobbying of their own. Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry and a host of Catholic bishops have weighed in in the State Capitol. And enviro billionaire Tom Steyer -- who first got involved in politics in 2010 when he joined forces with then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to beat back an oil industry-funded initiative to overturn the state's climate change program -- is countering Big Oil's multi-million dollar ad campaign.Governor Jerry Brown, introduced by the premier of Ontario as a major world leader in the fight against climate change, addressed July's Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada.While Brown has been very open to further development of existing California oil resources so long as oil is a major factor, which only makes sense from a state revenue and GDP standpoint, clearly his move to dramatically slash petroleum use long term is a threat to the ancien regime and its old ways of providing energy.As a result, the oil industry launched a massive advertising and lobbying campaign employing wild scare tactics to try to derail Brown's program. Big Oil claims that the state Air Resources Board will resort to gas rationing to meet the new standard.Most state legislators in the term limits era have little experience in high-level politics. The reality is that, well-intentioned as they may be, they are prone to falling prey to big money campaigns.Liberal Democrats tend to get big money from labor unions. Moderate Democrats get more from corporations. And the oil industry is calling on its longtime allies in the corporate community to try to hang on to their long-term massive perquisites and profit.Of course petroleum use in vehicles can be cut in half by 2030.The reality is that we are are already well on the way to achieving that.First, we will get halfway there simply by following advancing federal fuel efficiency standards. When Obama came into office, motivated in part as he said as a candidate on Earth Day in Iowa in 2007 by California's example, he established regulations to double gas mileage standards for new vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.We get the rest of the way there by doing the sorts of things we are already doing.Most of the reduction, says the Air Resources Board, will be accomplished by accelerating programs already underway. Increasing the numbers of zero-emission and low emission vehicles as well as the efficiency of more conventional vehicles will do much, as will further reducing carbon in transportation fuels, something already underway as a result of action by Schwarzenegger. Then there are increases in public transit and better urban planning.So this controversy isn't really about the public good. It's about the old fossil fuel regime refusing to let go of its hold on our oil addiction.The oil industry has launched a multi-million dollar scare campaign to derail California's efforts to fight climate change, including this ad falsely claiming that gas will be rationed in California as part of a plot to make life harder for average Californians.Slowly at first, then with gathering momentum after its 19th century in Pennsylvania, oil changed the world.Very cheap, readily available oil transformed America, turning it into a land of cars and sprawl. Then, after World War II, in which it was simply the essential strategic resource, oil transformed Europe and most of the rest of the world.Along the way, things were abandoned. Things like LA's public rail system, bought up and shuttered by oil and auto companies.\"The center of gravity of the world of oil production is shifting from the Gulf-Caribbean areas to the Middle East, to the Persian Gulf area, and is likely to continue to shift until it is firmly established in that area.\"Some suspected that America would not always produce all the oil it would need.So President Franklin D. Roosevelt, looking forward to the shape of the future post-war world while in the midst of the war, dispatched eminent oil geologist Everett de Golyer on a mission to the Middle East to gauge the region's potential. De Golyer reported back to FDR and his advisors that the Persian Gulf would become the pivot point of world energy.Roosevelt saw that Arab leaders would likely become very important. After he and Churchill and Stalin discussed the shape of the post-war world at their 1945 summit in Yalta, FDR paid a special visit to Saudi King Ibn Saud. Learning that the Saudis and their Gulf Arab allies were unhappy about plans to turn over Palestine for a Jewish state, Roosevelt agreed to consult with the Arabs before changing American policy to promote what would become Israel, issuing a presidential letter to that effect. But two months later, Roosevelt was dead and his unprepared successor Harry Truman, failing to understand the future importance of Arab oil, unilaterally changed the policy, infuriating the Arab world and setting up what would prove to be two antithetical US policies in the Middle East: Support for Israel and dependence on the Arabs.Fast forward a bit to April 1973. Cheap and easily available oil was the order of the day. State Department oil expert James Akins published a controversial bombshell essay in Foreign Affairs, linked here.The essay said we hadn't seen anything yet. From 1973 to 1985, Akins forecast, total world oil consumption would be greater than that in all history up to 1973. Oil prices would go up dramatically. And an Arab oil embargo could be a major political and economic weapon, given the West's fateful oil addiction and consequent vulnerability.Despite many denials, all that proved to be true.The Arab oil embargo after American intervention to save a losing Israel in the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 prompted much talk of alternative energy, conservation, and energy independence. Emerging leaders like Jerry Brown, who would become governor of California a year later at age 36, began their crusades.But once the shortage was over, consumption shot back up, even though the price of oil was much higher. Richard Nixon rolled back environmental standards in the quest for new fossil fuel energy. His successor, career auto industry advocate Gerald Ford of Michigan, slashed legislation for public transit.And money, power, and geopolitical focus shifted around the globe.After spending three days inspecting and discussing dramatic climate change in the vicinity of the North Pole, Obama returned to Washington to meet with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, the longtime world oil superpower.In the late 1970s, Fred Dutton, the chief US lawyer for Saudi Arabia -- whom I came to know because he was on the University of California Board of Regents, which I was helping push to disinvest from apartheid South Africa -- told me that the transfer of wealth from the West to his clients and the other Persian Gulf states was the greatest sudden transfer of wealth in world history. Even greater, said the former Pat Brown executive secretary and Bobby Kennedy campaign manager, than that of the Spanish conquistadors and their fabled treasure ships, or of Britain after winning the Napoleonic Wars.Today, with the Saudis in the lead, the price of oil is down a stunning 60 percent since June 2014. Which very much benefits Saudi Arabia, given its production costs, vast reserves, and competitive positioning in oil markets.This has caused a boost for the anemic US economy, while capping the potential of the revived yet higher-cost US oil industry. (It's largely squelched the potential of California fracking.) It has also led to a significant downdraft for historic Saudi bete noire Iran, and recession for petro-powerhouse Russia.Obama has to like three of those four results. But it has also produced the exact wrong price signal with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.Self-interest has always been paramount in the oil business.Partly in response to its new predicament, Vladimir Putin's Russia has moved aggressively to assert its interests in the Arctic, claiming another half-million square miles of territory in recent months. As the Arctic melts, a petroleum bonanza awaits beneath the formerly ice-locked surface.If global negotiations on climate change continue to falter, the planet will likely be cooked even faster.Even Obama is getting in on the Arctic act. In addition to his protestations of concern during his big Alaska trip, he's recently approved a Royal Dutch Shell project in the Arctic.The Saudis aren't happy with Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. But they've decided to live with the deal. Their position in the world is still quite positive, notwithstanding their protestations. And they can always buy a Bomb project if they need to.Meanwhile, they've got the Obama administration training rebel forces in the Syrian civil war. And the administration is keeping quiet about civilian deaths in the Saudis' little war in Yemen.The past doesn't just end automatically, you know.Facebook comments are closed on this article.William Bradley Archive"}, {"title": "Lion Hunting Dentist: He's Back!", "text": "Yesterday Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer, admitted killer of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe, granted an interview to Brian Bakst of the Associated Press and to Paul Walsh of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis. The Star Tribune has printed what is reportedly a full transcript of the interview: Click HERE to read.Palmer was accompanied by his unpaid adviser, Minneapolis lawyer Joe Friedberg. I too am an attorney, and I have decided to become an unpaid consultant to the late Cecil the Lion. I will be his Dr. Doolittle and give him a voice in this interview. I have inserted what I imagine Cecil would have said in response to some of the quotes attributable to Palmer and the other participants, as shown below.Palmer: I have a lot of staff members at River Bluff Dental. I'm a little heartbroken at the disruption in their lives. And I'm a health professional. I need to get back to treating my patients. My staff and my patients support me and they want me back. That's why I'm back. I'll be coming back this week.Cecil the Lion: I had a large pride on a protected preserve in Zimbabwe. I am a little heartbroken at the disruption of their lives. As the king of the jungle, I need to get back to caring for my cubs and pride. They and the staff at Oxford University (who were studying me) support me and want me back. Of course, I'll never come back-- because you killed me.Bakst: You said you've been visiting family and friends and kind of staying out of the public eye. Can you give us a sense of what you've been up to in those six weeks?Palmer: No. Just normal day off, for example, I, uh. It's a good question. Usually, I'm really busy. I just haven't been that busy.  Cecil the Lion: Usually, I'm really busy protecting my pride and posing for photos with tourists. I just haven't been that busy since you slaughtered me.Palmer: Well, I've been out of the public eye. That doesn't I mean I've been hiding. I've been among people, family and friends. The location is really not that important and I really wouldn't say. But I haven't been in hiding.Cecil the Lion: The location might be important. Please tell me that you haven't been hunting!Joe Friedberg: Look, as I understand this, he contracted with people who are lawfully allowed to provide services for a hunt in Zimbabwe. All kinds of papers and permits had to be obtained. As far as Walter knows, all of those were obtained and we have no reason to believe at this point that they weren't. Everything was done properly. This was a legal hunt for a lion in Zimbabwe and because of the professionalism of the people that he had to help him, a lion was taken, and, we believe, in an area where he could be taken and in a manner in which he could be taken.Cecil the Lion: Hmmm? In the movie Casablanca, Police Captain Louis Renault tells Rick \"I am shocked, shocked, to find that gambling is going on in here.\" (Ok, lions don't go to movies. I took some liberties here.)Palmer: The lion was not taken with a gun. It was not 40 hours later. It was followed up the next day and taken with a bow and arrow.  Cecil the Lion: Do you really think I care whether you finally killed me with a bow and arrow or a gun? I'm dead either way.Palmer: It was tracked and taken, dispatched the next day.Cecil the Lion: I was not an \"it.\" I was a proud lion. I was not \"taken, dispatched.\" I was killed, slaughtered, skinned, beheaded, and my remains left to rot.Bakst: Will you go back to Africa, or even back to Zimbabwe, or have you been spooked by this whole affair?Palmer: I don't know about the future, Brian. But I can say what Joe said, Zimbabwe has been a wonderful country for me to hunt in and I've always followed the laws for the country I'm in.Cecil the Lion: Did you follow the laws when you allegedly pleaded guilty to felony charges of making false statements to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the killing of a bear in Wisconsin in 2008? Please stay away from Zimbabwe-- I have family and friends there.Palmer: Nobody in our hunting party knew before or after the name of this lion.Cecil the Lion: My name was Cecil.  Palmer: It's been especially hard on my wife and daughter. They've been threatened. In the media, as well, and the social media, and again, Brian, I don't understand that level of humanity, to come after people not involved at all.  Cecil: It's been especially hard on my family. They keep waiting for me to return. They've been threatened and killed by other lions. I don't understand your level of humanity-- to kill me for fun.Here's some classic humanity for you:"}, {"title": "This Is The Year Humans Finally Got Serious About Saving Themselves From Themselves", "text": "Here on planet Earth, things could be going better.

Usually a gentle dog, Daisy -- who Guest had been training to detect diseases with her keen sense of smell -- refused to get into the car, and instead collided into Guest a few times before “prodding” her in the chest.Daisy’s strange behavior prompted Guest to check the area where the dog had nudged her. Tests later revealed that she had early-stage breast cancer. Her doctor told her she was “incredibly lucky” to have found it so early.“All I could think was, what a difference Daisy has made,” Guest told The Telegraph in 2014. “I might have had to have aggressive chemotherapy. I might not have survived. That’s what made me decide: right, we’ve got to discover what’s going on.”Six years on, a cancer-free Guest is one of the leaders in the field of disease-detecting canines. Her organization, Medical Detection Dogs, recently gained approval from Britain’s National Health Service to conduct a landmark clinical trial to test dogs’ ability to sniff out prostate cancer cells.NBC News called the trial “groundbreaking.”Earlier studies have suggested that dogs’ incredible sense of smell can detect subtle odors known to be associated with many cancers, such as melanoma and cancers of the breast, bladder and lung. In the case of prostate cancer, Guest says initial tests have shown trained dogs to have a detection accuracy rate of more than 93 percent.“Our dogs have higher rates of reliability than most of the existing tests. We know their sense of smell is extraordinary. They can detect parts per trillion -- that’s the equivalent of one drop of blood in two Olympic-sized swimming pools,” she told The Guardian. “We should not be turning our backs on these highly sensitive bio-detectors just because they have furry coats.”Medical Detection Dogs says it typically trains its canines for about six months before the animals are able to reliably sniff out trace amounts of cancer cells in urine samples. Once trained, the dogs will either stop and sit down by the sample, lick the bottle, or bark to indicate they’ve detected the scent of cancer cells.According to Guest, trained dogs are able to detect this scent almost instantly.“These dogs have the ability to screen hundreds of samples in a day; it's something they find very easy, they enjoy their work. To them it's a hunt game -- they find the cancer,” she told Reuters.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the U.K., and one of the most common causes of cancer death. The Prostate-Specific Antigen test, or PSA, is currently used to detect the disease; however, the procedure is known to have a high false positive rate, which means many men end up undergoing the invasive test unnecessarily.Scientists say cancer-sniffing dogs may be able to help reveal inaccuracies in the PSA test, and eventually help in the development of much better cancer screening services, such as an “electronic nose” that could help sniff out cancer cells the way dogs’ noses do.Researchers also hope that dogs’ acute sense of smell could be used in the detection of many other diseases.“This is opening a new way of diagnosing diseases and conditions in the future,” Guest told Reuters.Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Sorry, But Your Cat Really Doesn't Need You Around", "text": "What does your cat think of you?

The experiment is modeled to help scientists gauge how attached children are to their mothers.Similarly, the researchers placed 20 pet cats in an unfamiliar room and then observed how they responded when they were left alone in the room with a stranger, their owner, or simply by themselves. The researchers selected cats whose owners said were particularly attached to them, Live Science reported.What did the researchers find? The cats vocalized slightly more meows when their owners left them in the room with a stranger, but the researchers didn't notice any additional evidence to suggest that the cats were strongly attached to their owners.\"This vocalization might simply be a sign of frustration or learned response, since no other signs of attachment were reliably seen,\" Mills said in a written statement. \"In strange situations, attached individuals seek to stay close to their carer, show signs of distress when they are separated and demonstrate pleasure when their attachment figure returns, but these trends weren’t apparent during our research.\"The study was published online in the journal Plos One on September 2, 2015.Also on HuffPost Science:"}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Delicious Change is Just Around the Corner -- Bar Bombon", "text": "Nicole Marquis has already conquered her hometown of Philadelphia, serving up meatless fast food at HipCityVeg and vegan small plates and strong drinks at Charlie was a sinner.

Head To A National Park, Study Says.", "text": "Some 99 percent of the world's skies are polluted with light, scientists say -- meaning some man-made form of brightness has overshadowed the night sky's brilliance across most of the planet. That means health impacts on plants, animals and humans, and, of course, an utter loss of natural beauty as we lose the ability to see the constellations.But according to a new study published in the journal Park Science, national parks -- especially those far removed from urban areas -- could be the last bastion of true darkness we have left and a model for what humanity should aspire to.Led by Robert Manning, a researcher at the University of Vermont, the study deems the night skies a \"new\" park resource that can draw visitors to protected spaces, like the 59 national parks currently operating in the U.S.Only one-third of Americans can still see the Milky Way from their homes these days, so Manning and his team conducted a study at Acadia National Park to see how important seeing the cosmos was to visitors. Unsurprisingly, a vast majority said yes, night sky viewing is important, and the National Park Service should protect opportunities to see it.\"There is a growing consciousness in the U.S. about the disappearance of naturally dark skies that's kind of paradoxical,\" Manning told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's one of those things that we start to notice only when it begins to disappear.\"But what's to be done? Actually, a lot.The study found quite a bit of light pollution comes from large cities, as expected. And lights pointed up toward the sky or sideways could be contributing far more to the problem than those pointed down at the ground. The researchers point toward a collaborative effort between Acadia and the neighboring town of Bar Harbor, Maine, to help cut back on intrusive light pollution into the park as a successful means of restoring peak darkness.Simple acts, like cutting back on headlamps and flashlight use inside the parks can also make a big difference. Fortunately, unlike other environmental problems, light pollution is actually solvable.\"Night skies [are] a good example of where progress is being made and a lot more progress can be made,\" Manning said. \"Unlike a lot of other environmental problems, light pollution is reversible.\"H/T Los Angeles TimesAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "SeaWorld Changes Policy On Whales In Sign It's Bowing To Pressure", "text": "In the surest sign yet that SeaWorld may be swaying to public pressure in the wake of “Blackfish,” the marine park publicly announced an unprecedented change in policy this week."}, {"title": "Jessica Alba Slams Accusations Against The Honest Company", "text": "Jessica Alba's Honest Company is being sued for, well, dishonesty.

The class-action suit, led by consumer Jonathan D. Rubin, is demanding an estimated $5 million in damages.Now, Alba has spoken out. In a written statement provided to Pret-a-Reporter, she's called the allegations \"baseless and without merit.\" She explained:We believe that consumers deserve to know what’s in their products — whether it’s diapers for their children, cleaning products for their families or beauty products for themselves. Our formulations are made with integrity and strict standards of safety, and we label each ingredient that goes into every product - not because we have to, but because it's the right thing to do.The Honest Company, worth an estimated $1.7 billion, made headlines earlier this year when its famous co-founder was hailed as one of the country's richest self-made businesswomen.But last month it faced well-publicized complaints over an SPF 30 sunscreen that left consumers burnt and angry. The Honest Company defended the product at the time, but the lawsuit specifically names the sunscreen, calling it \"ineffective in preventing unhealthy exposure to harmful UV rays.\"Ingredients the suit claims are mislabeled include the synthetic preservatives Methylisothiazolinone and Phenoxyethanol, a synthetic surfactant called Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and the petrochemical-based Sodium Polyacrylate, according to The Wrap.The Food and Drug Administration, however, does not regulate the term \"natural\" on cosmetic, cleaning or even food labels.\"I know my children, Honor and Haven, are growing up in a safer home because of our products,\" Alba said in the statement.

Climate Change Will Make It Worse.", "text": "The hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe or dying on the way to its shores could be a harbinger of things to come, researchers and policymakers warn, because a potentially greater driver of displacement looms on the horizon: climate change.As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned at a recent State Department-led conference on climate change in the Arctic, the scenes of chaos and heartbreak in Europe will be repeated globally unless the world acts to mitigate climate change.\"Wait until you see what happens when there's an absence of water, an absence of food, or one tribe fighting against another for mere survival,\" Kerry said.World leaders have long warned that natural disasters and degraded environments linked to climate change could -- indeed, have already started to -- drive people from their homes. UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres declared in 2009 that climate change will create millions of refugees and internally displaced populations. \"Not only states, but cultures and identities will be drowned,\" Guterres said.Displacement is already happening in some parts of the world. Almost 28 million people on average were displaced by environmental disasters every year between 2008 and 2013, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center -- roughly three times as many as were forced from their homes by conflict and violence.It's difficult to predict exactly how many more may be displaced as climate change progresses. \"When global warming takes hold there could be as many as 200 million people overtaken\" by the consequences, professor Norman Myers of Oxford University argued in a 2005 paper. For comparison’s sake, 350,000 migrants sought entry into the European Union in 2014, the International Organization for Migration estimated.Few countries or international organizations are prepared to deal with environmentally displaced people. As a 2011 report from the European Parliament's Directorate-General for Internal Policies detailed, there is no specific legal protection for \"environmentally displaced individuals\" beyond temporary measures that would prove insufficient if the environmental damage to their homeland endured.The UN has a non-binding agreement on internal displacement from 1998 that includes provisions for people fleeing natural disasters, but it is not obligatory and includes no penalties for countries that ignore it, as Roger Zetter, a professor emeritus in refugee studies at Oxford, told The Huffington Post. The portions addressing natural disasters focus on storms, not the more complex and slow-onset effects of climate change.Myers’ sensational prediction of hundreds of millions of climate change refugees has come under fire in the years since its 2005 publication. \"It’s a very contentious overestimate,\" Zetter said. \"It’s a back-of-the-envelope figure.\"It’s difficult, if not impossible, to get data on the number of current migrants who left their homes primarily because of climate change. For most, environmental degradation is one factor among many, Zetter and other experts cautioned. Nevertheless, climate change-related environmental impacts will present \"very significant challenges,\" Zetter said.“What climate change and displacement do is present developmental problems for countries that are already struggling,\" he explained. \"If you’ve got to start spending more and more money on flood relief channels or earthquake-proof buildings or increasing huge water transfer programs to cope with depleting aquifers, there’s no question that it will add a huge additional financial burden and make planning and development strategies more difficult.”And for some countries, climate change poses an immediate and very real threat -- countries like the small island states threatened by rising seas. \"If there's no land, they’ll have to leave,\" Zetter said.That includes places like Kiribati, a country made up of 33 islands in the remote South Pacific. Kiribati will be among the first countries to vanish beneath the rising ocean, possibly as soon as the end of this century. But long before then, its atolls and reef islands will be uninhabitable for their 103,000 residents if a violent storm comes crashing through, or if the ocean seeps into their already inadequate supply of fresh groundwater. Half of the country's citizens live on the Tarawa Atoll, a crescent of white sand two-thirds of a mile across whose highest point is just 10 feet above the ocean.Operating on the unfortunate assumption that the sea will swallow the country, the government of Kiribati purchased 6,000 acres of land in Fiji last year, in case they need to uproot an entire people and put them somewhere else.Major storms and flooding already cause tremendous displacement -- almost 28 million per year on average, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. Many more are affected, but not necessarily displaced -- an average of 140 million people yearly, the International Panel on Climate Change reports. Scientists expect climate change to make violent storms like Typhoon Haiyan, which forced a million people to flee their homes in the Philippines in 2013, stronger and more frequent.Typhoons and monsoon floods hit people hard and fast, forcing them to literally flee for their lives. Scientists call those rapid-onset climate events. But there are also slow-onset climate events like drought, desertification and sea level rise.These slow-moving changes are \"much more difficult to relate to mobility patterns,\" Albert Kraler, a program manager for research at the International Center for Migration Policy Development in Vienna, told HuffPost. Often, environmental changes are just \"one of the factors informing people’s migration choices.\"Despite the difficulty in determining exact numbers, the United Nations Environment Program concluded in a 2011 study on the Sahel, a semi-arid belt across northern Africa, that \"migration occurs when livelihoods cannot be maintained, especially when agriculture or herding is severely affected by environmental degradation or extreme events.\"The changes in the Sahel are perhaps the most obvious example of slow-onset events. The UN dubbed the region \"ground zero\" for climate change \"due to its extreme climatic conditions and highly vulnerable population.\" Its arid climate and infrequent rain are getting worse, and scientists blame climate change. The rain is less predictable than it used to be -- sometimes there is too much and sometimes nowhere near enough. For almost everyone in the Sahel, food has become more expensive and scarcer. As a result, 30 percent of households in Burkina Faso, in the heart of the Sahel, have relocated in the last 20 years because they could no longer survive, The Guardian reported in 2013.People have always migrated across this region. But these days, \"the traditional temporary and seasonal migration patterns of many farmers, herders and fishermen in the region are increasingly being replaced by a more permanent shift southward and to urban areas,\" UNEP reports. \"Nearly half of the West African population now lives in largely overcrowded coastal cities, including 12 townships of over one million inhabitants along the coastline from Senegal to Nigeria.\"The population of the Sahel region is expected to skyrocket over the next few decades. Competition between tribes and ethnic groups, pastoralists, farmers and fishermen over ever-scarcer natural resources, which has existed for as long as people have lived there, is becoming intense. And then there's Boko Haram. Its fighters have set up camps on islands emerging out of Lake Chad, a once-majestic expanse of fresh water that in the past supported millions of people in the heart of the Sahel. But the lake has lost 90 percent of its area since the 1960s. Now, there’s a militant Muslim fundamentalist insurgency taking hold amid an ongoing environmental disaster.Climate change is also a factor in the worsening storms and environmental degradation of coastal South Asia -- factors that, when combined with mismanagement and political dysfunction, are putting millions of people at risk. Some have already started to migrate because their ways of living are becoming impossible. In the Indus delta in Pakistan, entire villages have been wiped off the map. Bangladeshis and Indians in the Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest where the Ganges meets the sea, are heading inland, away from the rising ocean and the increasingly saline farmland.Bangladesh is expected to be the largest single source of climate refugees, with up to 30 million people at risk. Many end up in slums in cities like Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital and the world’s fastest-growing megacity. Some 70 percent of Dhaka’s slum dwellers moved there because of environmental degradation, according to the International Organization for Migration.Migrants and refugees across the world, driven by rapid-onset natural disasters or by a complex combination of the more slow-moving effects of a changing climate, are already putting immense strain on the countries and cities they end up in. A lot of the time locals aren’t happy to see them, and many governments have been caught unprepared and unwilling to take them in.Already, migrants and refugees across the world are already putting immense strain on the countries and cities where they end up.In Europe, Hungary is putting up a fence to keep migrants and refugees out. \"We don't want to [live together with Muslims],” Hungary’s prime minister Victor Orban said on Thursday, \"and I think we have a right to decide that we do not want a large number of Muslim people in our country.\"For the past two years, Australia has deployed its navy to force migrants and asylum-seekers away. The government allegedly bribed one captain more than $30,000 to take his boatload of migrants to Indonesia. Other migrants are being held in detention centers on tiny islands like Nauru, where, according to an Australian Senate committee report, children are sexually abused and guards offer weed in exchange for sex.As for America, when residents of Kivalina, a Native village in northwestern Alaska that is rapidly disappearing into the ocean, tried to get the government to lend a hand, the response they received was that \"there's no agency set up to address those questions.\"Europe's handling of the current refugee situation doesn’t bode well for a future in which vulnerable populations fleeing the effects of climate change are again knocking at their doors. Nor does it seem likely that Western countries will embark on the expensive and challenging task of helping at-risk countries prepare, as John Kerry warned we must do. The Western world is facing a lot of tough questions, Zetter said.\"We've not faced up to the challenge that we obviously are the emitters, that we are creating climate change, that we are creating this additional pressure on the developmental trajectories that many countries face,\" he said."}, {"title": "Arctic Reality", "text": "Last week, President Obama made the most extensive presidential visit to Alaska ever. He hiked on a glacier, met with Alaska Native leaders, and became the first president ever to visit the Arctic Circle. Throughout, he was calling attention to the real, on-the-ground effects of climate change. That makes sense given that Alaska is being affected by global warming more dramatically and more swiftly than any other state.Alaska has already warmed 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 60 years according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment. This year alone, wildfires in the state have burned more than 5 million acres. Ironically, this is happening in a state that is uniquely dependent on the oil and gas industries. Yet allowing those industries to extract all of Alaska's considerable fossil fuel reserves would not only destroy much of its incredible wilderness but also lead to even worse climate disruption -- not just for Alaska, but for the world:\"Our results suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 degrees Celsius,\" Paul Ekins and Christophe McGlade wrote in the journal Nature earlier this year. \"We show that development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\" [3.6 degrees Fahrenheit]It's that simple: If we want to limit global warming then we cannot continue developing new fossil fuel resources in the Arctic. That reality is what President Obama and his administration ignored by allowing Shell Oil to proceed with drilling in the Chukchi Sea this summer. They also ignored the reality that a spill in Arctic seas would be an unprecedented environmental disaster. Or, perhaps it's fairer to say that they decided it was a risk they were willing to take. On that point, we can only hope they get lucky -- although if Shell continues drilling, the administration's own calculations show that the odds are not in their favor, with a 75 percent chance of a major spill.As Rebecca Solnit poignantly wrote in The Guardian, \"There is an ugly irony about extracting oil from one of the places already threatened by the effects of burning fossil fuel -- where the summer ice is much reduced and temperatures are shooting up: you make the place complicit in its own destruction.\"President Obama said it himself almost a year ago: \"We are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it.\" President Obama has stepped up in many ways -- with the Clean Power Plan, with stronger fuel-economy measures, and other initiatives. Those are all good but, in this case, good isn't good enough. Our generation needs greatness. Mistakes like opening the Arctic to new drilling are no way to get there.Tell President Obama to cancel all remaining and proposed Arctic offshore drilling leases for the coming years."}, {"title": "A Three-Minute Trick To Preserve A Summer's Worth Of Fresh Herbs", "text": "Maybe you went crazy in the spring, planting starter herbs of rosemary, mint, thyme, oregano and marjoram.

A video is set to be released on September 11, and will include celebrities, scientists and others holding up messages of support for our environment.While the artists want to convey a sense of urgency in fighting climate change, Bedingfield, who also helped write the song along with Gad, John Shanks and Sean Paul, says the song is ultimately meant to uplift others in regards to the subject.“We wanted to write a song that is about how when you love something, you look after it,” Bedingfield said in a statement. \"While we know about the environmental issues, we’re unsure if there is any hope. With this song we wanted to talk about the environment in a way that would help people feel empowered to do something rather than be paralyzed by fear.”To learn more about Friends of the Earth, visit its website here.

Our final taste of summer would be incomplete without a stop at a local seafood shack to savor the delicacies of the sea dockside, amidst the fishing boats, cackling seagulls and salty dogs. We feel an intimate connection to the ocean diving into a crashing wave or savoring our first bite of lobster, oyster or crab, ingesting the smell and taste of the sea. Perfection!This summer, consider taking a minute to talk to the person selling you the seafood--or better yet a fisherman on the dock. You will feel their sense of pride and maybe even hear a few great stories. These stories are similar the world over from San Pedro, Chile to Bath, Maine: fishermen are fiercely independent and proud of what they do, and have done for generations. On a recent visit to Chile we met a fisherman, nicknamed Chocolat, on the docks who told us:\"I love the work on the water because it's diverse. I can do farming, catch squid, catch fish, go diving. I have the freedom of the water and the sea provides for me.\"We are conducting intensive research in places like Chile, Mexico, South Africa, Senegal and Indonesia to spread the stories of these individual 'smallholder' fishers--stories that we at The Rockefeller Foundation and our partners believe are critical to sustaining the wealth and diversity of our oceans--the foundation of the connection we may feel with the sea.A Humanitarian CrisisThe New York Times recently ran an investigative series on fishermen which shared vastly different stories, highlighting brutal, de-humanizing conditions. In open oceans outside the reach of any government or enforcement agency fishers are stripped of their dignity and pride, shackled to boats and held in cages like circus animals, often murdered for any show of defiance, and dumped into the ocean when they are sick or unable to work for 20 hours a day. All to put shrimp on our tables, and fish sticks in our freezers.These unacceptable and egregious violations of human rights highlight how sustainable seafood is a human issue as much as it is an environmental one--in fact the two are inextricably entwined. As our oceans get over-fished, the costs of fishing increase and the profits from fishing decline as boats chase fewer, smaller fish--all making the conditions for fishermen more and more desperate.As a consumer, you might be tempted to stop consuming the seafood from Thailand, where there is a direct link to slavery, as it is common in US markets and restaurants and thus easy to boycott,. But would that actually help the hundreds of millions of fishers across the developing world whose livelihoods depend on this export industry?Painful ProgressWhile these heartbreaking stories help us see the world as it is, our response should not be to turn away. Amidst this dark landscape we are starting to see a few bright spots of hope.Progress has been made on environmental issues throughout the supply chain. For example, about 10 percent of global seafood is currently certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, and an additional 10 percent is in a Fishery Improvement Project, meaning it's not yet sustainable but working to get there. The large social movement and certification group Fair Trade also recently got involved in seafood, providing a direct financial benefit to retailers and fishers for socially and environmentally sound fishing practices--delivering ethically sourced food to our tables.These are very promising developments. But on their own certifications and improvement efforts don't currently address the fundamental issues driving slavery in seafood supply chains. The lack of transparency into who catches what, where it goes, and who buys it coupled with the absence of political will to create and enforce strong regulations creates a climate of uncertainty where lawlessness thrives.These are both collective and individual failures of us as consumers, the politicians we elect, and an industry who benefits from our unquestioning goodwill. The end result is that the fish we eat is disconnected from the people who catch it. And this lack of connection means that myriad abuses and human indignities are ignored. While slavery is the worst among them, other deplorable conditions like life-threatening working conditions at sea, volatile livelihoods, and the misery of aging in a labor intensive industry are common. This is the price that fishers pay to provide the catch of the day to our groceries, restaurants and beachfront grills.Reasons for HopeWe can do better. And it starts with rebuilding our connection to the sea, and the people whose lives are shaped by its vagaries and vicissitudes: the fisher.We've heard inspiring stories from fishers that amaze us with ingenuity and entrepreneurship in places as far flung and different as Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia. And stories that pluck our heartstrings with the determination and will power to succeed against devastating odds.Like the cooperative in South Africa who, since unbankable by traditional financial institutions, have created an ingenious and equitable financial system that divides their fishing quota on a rotating basis, to ensure everyone at least gets something. Participants also pay into a community fund to take care of those who are unable to fish--meeting their own economic and social needs without reliance on banks or government agencies.Or the crab fishers in Indonesia, who face the difficult choice of complying with a new regulation that drastically limits what they can catch in an effort to restore a damaged fishery, or to fish what they can now to put food on the tables and send their children to school. There are few options here, but fishers are working with our partners to succeed despite these odds.We spent several weeks with these crab fishers--visiting their homes, exploring markets, meeting with middlemen and seafood buyers with a design team from the Dalberg Design Impact Group. We prototyped a loyalty program to help ease the transition to the new regulations that may drive fishers out of work. Fishers can earn points for delivering mature, healthy crabs and redeem those points for either cash or food to support their families with basic sustenance when fishing isn't possible. Or they can upgrade or retrofit to more sustainable fishing gear (such as traps with escape hatches for juvenile crabs) at a reduced price, reducing the direct cost to the fishermen of the new law. While still just an idea, we believe this loyalty program can make fishers lives less painful and get more responsible crab on our plates.These stories begin to bridge the gap in our understanding of what it takes, from a human perspective, to put food on our tables. And they give us ideas of new solutions we can develop with fishers to improve their lives and make our food system more responsible for everyone.The Resilience of the SeaWe think these solutions are innovative, and an exciting first step. But alone they cannot rectify the unacceptable human conditions in our global seafood industry and among fishing nations that result in the horrifying profiles of depravity like those portrayed in The New York Times.The fact remains that our seafood system is broken, and we all bear some part of that responsibility: governments for failing to develop and enforce regulations, the seafood industry for turning a blind eye, and us as consumers for being all too willing to savor what's on our plate without understanding the story of how it got there and demanding better.But by bringing a focus to the human aspects of a challenged industry, we may rectify a small, but critical part of the bigger challenge of our weak connection with the sea. The ocean--one of the most resilient resources on the planet--and the people who live off of it, are perhaps our greatest assets in figuring out how to make positive change happen that will benefit us all.As one of the fishers we met in Chile said to us:\"We overfished the ocean, working only as individuals, only working for ourselves. We killed the species by working that way and [the result was that] for eight years no one could be a fisher. Now, our fishers are more concerned about working together to protect the ocean and protect our community.\"So as we all make our final visits to the ocean this summer, as you look out over the water and see the fishing boats on the horizon, think of the fisherman out there, or the many others thousands of miles away, pursuing the solitary, dangerous, skillful, backbreaking and at its best--deeply fulfilling--task of catching a fish for you to enjoy.And perhaps being conscious of the labors and difficulties that got that fish to your plate adds a new taste to the end of summer--one that right now is bitter and rotten, but that has the promise of a deeper, richer deliciousness--if we could only dive in and fix a system that is broken, for all of us."}, {"title": "Artificial Elephant Tusks Are Being Used To Help Track The Illegal Ivory Trade", "text": "National Geographic: How Killing Elephants Finances Terror in AfricaEach year, tens of thousands of African elephants are killed for their tusks by poachers as part of the ivory trade, which continues despite being largely illegal. With more elephants being killed than born in recent years, it is estimated that the species could be extinct within just a few decades. With park rangers struggling to fend off the poachers, solutions to the problem have been difficult to come by.In an effort to get to the bottom of the illegal ivory trade, the National Geographic’s Bryan Christy had an unusual idea.Christy approached taxidermist George Dante at the American Museum of Natural History and asked him to design fake elephant tusks that closely resemble those the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had previously confiscated. The fake tusks would be equipped with GPS and satellite-based tracking capabilities, allowing Christy to follow the tusks’ journey and, potentially, gather information to help officials locate and identify poachers.Christy documented the tusks' journey in a lengthy National Geographic cover story and a documentary. The tusks were inserted along a route Christy understood would take them out of Garamba National Park. They continued into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The tusks went on to Central African Republic and wound up in the Darfur region of Sudan, where they were last tracked.The tusks’ path corroborated interviews Christy did claiming that militias and terrorist groups were behind much of the ivory trade in East Africa, particularly Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army.The trade could be in trouble, however. China, the world’s biggest consumer of ivory, agreed earlier this year to phase out its ivory industry, a move Christy told NPR last month “could be a game-changer.” As FastCompany noted, too, Christy’s experiment may cause government or wildlife advocacy groups to use similar technology to take on poachers in the future.MORE:The Aspen Times: Aspen is third U.S. city to reach 100% renewable energyGOOD: Meet The Clothing Brand Empowering Women in India to Escape the Sex TradeThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

In fact, the recent Consumer Reports study profiled in the article revealed that every sample of ground beef collected by researchers from supermarkets around the country contained enterococcus and/or nontoxin-producing E. coli, which indicate fecal contamination. In other words, all the beef had poop on it.Pretty gross. And pretty dangerous - since feces can contain a host of harmful bacteria that can sicken (or kill) humans, this degree of contamination presents a serious food safety risk. In fact, according to a report by the FDA and CDC, 46 percent of E. coli O157 illnesses and nine percent of foodborne Salmonella illnesses could be attributed to beef. Between 2003 and 2012, outbreaks of E. coli O157 related to beef (mostly ground beef) sickened 1,144 people, causing 316 hospitalizations and five deaths.Why so Contaminated? As with many problems related to livestock production, it all goes back to manure. When beef cattle are slaughtered and processed, fecal matter from their hides and intestines can end up in contact with the cuts of meat and fat trimmings. The problem is exacerbated by the high speeds at which cattle are processed in industrial facilities (some slaughter as many as 400 cattle per hour), which creates more room for human error, increasing the likelihood of feces ending up on meat.Industrial production practices also contribute to the problem; cattle raised \"conventionally\" spend the end of their lives being fattened within confined feedlots without vegetation, where they often stand in mud and their own manure. On average, these factory farms hold 4,300 beef cattle, but many are much larger; feedlots confining 32,000 or more cattle represent 40 percent of the market. Put that many animals in giant bath of mud and manure, and you end up with some pretty filthy cattle being sent to the slaughterhouse. Factory farmed cattle are also fattened on an unnatural diet of grain, which increases the level of acidity in their digestive tracts, and which scientists believe may cause greater shedding of E. coli from the cattle.Ground beef is particularly susceptible to contamination since the grinding process exposes more surface area to bacteria. Furthermore, huge industrial processing facilities typically create an end product composed of meat and fat from many different cows, increasing the risk that tainted meat from one cow ends up contaminating meat from many others. From a food safety perspective, ground meat is also problematic since, unless it's cooked thoroughly all the way through, harmful bacteria can persist after the food is served. (Conversely, with whole cuts of beef, bacteria are more likely to be present on the outside of the meat, and therefore killed during cooking.)Putting Ground Beef to the Test In order to determine exactly how contaminated our ground beef really is, Consumer Reports (CR) undertook an ambitious study, testing 300 packages of ground beef (a total of 458 pounds) from 103 stores in 26 U.S. cities. CR also chose to investigate whether the rates of bacterial contamination differ between beef from cattle raised \"conventionally\" (i.e., from cattle fattened on grain in feedlots and typically given antibiotics and/or growth-promoting drugs), and beef from cattle raised more sustainably (in this category, CR included beef that had one or more of the following characteristics: no antibiotics, organic and grass-fed).CR scientists analyzed 181 \"conventional\" and 119 \"more sustainable\" beef samples to identify five common types of bacteria: Clostridium perfringens, E. coli (including O157 and six other toxin-producing strains), enterococcus, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus. Scientists also tested all bacteria that were discovered to determine if they were resistant to antibiotics in the same classes used to treat humans.Complete results of the study are available in CR's full report, but a few key findings are worth noting:As Urvashi Rangan, Ph.D., executive director of the Center for Food Safety and Sustainability at Consumer Reports said of the study, \"[w]e know that sustainable methods are better for the environment and more humane to animals. But our tests also show that these methods can produce ground beef that poses fewer public health risks.\"What to Do about Tainted Beef? Based on their findings, Consumer Reports made several recommendations to the FDA and USDA, calling on the agencies to prohibit the use of antibiotics in healthy animals, reduce consumer confusion by banning meaningless labels like \"natural,\" expand the animal welfare standards for organic beef, improve food safety inspection at slaughter and processing facilities, ban the sale of beef containing antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, and (our personal favorite), to prohibit the inclusion of chicken waste in cattle feed (because yes, factory farm operators actually engage in this practice).Consumer Reports advises consumers to keep raw meat from touching other foods, to cook ground beef to at least 160 F and to reheat leftovers containing ground beef to at least 165 F. They also recommend choosing sustainable beef whenever possible, looking for meaningful labels like \"grass-fed,\" \"organic,\" \"no antibiotics,\" and third-party verified labels like Animal Welfare Approved Grassfed, American Grassfed Association, and Food Alliance Grassfed.You can find many of the restaurants, farms, farmers' markets and other businesses that offer sustainably produced beef using GRACE's Eat Well Guide.

Where are we going to get enough clean water?\")...Let's for a minute put our heads (and hearts) together on this: First of all, it's truly wonderful that Americans are drinking water rather than soda. This is a Big Win. And second, who among us hasn't been grateful for cold water from the refrigerated beverage section after our water bottle from home has been emptied, its ice long since melted? Third, I think we can all say we want whatever water we drink to be clean, pure, and toxin free.Now let's take another moment and be grateful that we have that choice at all. There are still many places in the world where clean drinkable water is not available at all--in any kind of container or from any sort of tap.Here are 5 things we can all do right now to make sure we ALL have clean water--from our taps, in our bottles, and of course, in our rivers, lakes, and oceans:1. Use organic farming and land management (no toxins). Removing synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides from our farms stops their being leached into our wells, streams, and rivers and causing dead zones in our bays and oceans. Buy organic food and manage your land organically. It's easy!2. Use natural remedies. Think twice before you accept a prescription you don't really need (like an antibiotic for a virus like a cold or the flu). And NEVER flush prescription medicines down the toilet. (Although, many pharmaceuticals go through your body, anyway, so yes, you are flushing some of them down the toilet even if you don't empty your prescription bottle into the bowl.) Of course, get medicines when you need them, but opt for natural remedies whenever possible. (For more information on how to safely dispose of old medication, click here.)3. Use renewable energy (no fracking). Fracking causes a lot of problems, including polluting wells and waterways. But so do a lot of other fossil fuels. (Think oil spills or the fact that, according to WIRED magazine, \"a single barrel of oil produces ten barrels of waste water.\") Try alternative renewable energy--like solar, wind, and geothermal--whenever possible, and support its growth and expansion.4. Use careful consumption and manufacturing (glass, not plastic!). When in doubt, buy your drinks in glass, not plastic. And buy your products from companies and people that care about how things are made. Yes, that requires rewiring your brain to think source, not price. But if we all do it, prices will become reasonable for everyone. After all, it's all connected! The water is circulating in, out, and through all of us!5. Know your watershed. Last, but not least, get to know your watershed. Protect it. Adopt it. Enjoy it. Swim in it! Seek to understand it.If we do all five of these things, our oceans will be cleaner and healthier. Our country will be cleaner and healthier. And then we can spend our time helping countries that need them build wells. We can set an example--be the type of leaders that people want to follow. Together, we can set in motion steps that can bring clean water to everyone.For more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com"}, {"title": "Your Cat Doesn't Miss You When Leave: Study", "text": "The truth hurts: Your cat doesn't really care whether you stay or go.A new study suggests that it's not because your cat is a selfish beast.

The same palm oil which is found in our chocolates and skin creams is also accused of being a major contributor to climate changing green house gases that will affect us all from Kiribati to California. These are the issues most commonly associated with \"palm oil.\"On the issue of carbon emissions, we in developed nations who make up a mere 20 percent of humans worldwide are responsible for a staggering 70 percent of global emissions . Simply put, if the intention to fight climate change on a global front is honest, developed countries including those in the European Union and North America would be mandating how much their citizens can consume. Doing this however, would likely mean high unemployment rates and poverty, which describes life today for millions of people in developing and underdeveloped countries.In the case of palm oil, we \"speak for the environment\" by demanding that palm oil be produced sustainably. The popular definition of sustainable palm oil comes from Greenpeace and enjoys wide support by social media activists. Its definition focuses on protecting HCS or High Carbon Stock forests (meaning climate-change-fighting forests) while maintaining the rights of local peoples to either accept or reject palm oil plantations in their communities. The one factor they've failed to address is local communities that may want to clear HCS forests to grow palm oil. What is the solution there? Do we tell these villagers who own a few acres of primary forests that we will not accept any palm oil they grow as sustainable?Sustainable palm oil cannot be only about orangutans or saving forests to fight climate change.People's lives have to be a key consideration in any definition of \"sustainable\" palm oil. Up to this point, the arguments are focused too heavily on whether its sustainable cultivation will save forests and benefit the lives of people that are for the most part, thousands of miles away from where it's grown.Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) by impacted local communities is added as a second thought to allow local people to make a choice between keeping their status quo as forest dwellers or turning it into small palm oil plantations as long as long as those lands are not considered HCS forests.Greenpeace speaks of a \"forest conservation revolution\" and urges governments and corporations to back up their commitments with action. Corporations in Indonesia have indeed taken action. In a historic pledge, Indonesian palm oil growers that control over 80 percent of Indonesia's palm oil production have agreed to not plant on peat lands or HCS areas.This was a commendable pledge on the part of signatories of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge(IPOP) Asian Agri, Cargill, Golden Agri-Resources, Wilmar Group, Musim Mas and the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, but will it work as a global standard for sustainable palm oil?The Indonesian government has criticized the zero deforestation pledge as a move by private companies that have overstepped their authority...Quoting the Environment and Forestry's Director General:\"For me the pledge already breaches the State Constitution. We lose our sovereignty because we are controlled [by the pledge]. Our authority is being taken over by the private sector.\"On a micro scale, the rejection of a broad no deforestation policy has already been felt by Golden Agri-Resources. In this long drawn out case in Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan, frustrated farmers on the issue of HCS were quoted as saying:\"Not all people even understand HCV yet. In Kapuas Hulu already 50 percent of the district is in conservation areas, so please don't disturb us with more. Go to the National Park and don't disturb us with HCV and HCS!\"African nations also have plans to create millions of hectares of palm oil plantations for self sufficiency and the same issue of saving forests versus development is being argued. Sir Jonathan Porritt who is leading a study to define HCS forests had this to say after a recent visit to Liberia:in the event of a 'zero deforestation' commitment being imposed upon them in Liberia, there would be very little if any further oil palm development... I have no reason to believe that they're( groups that committed to zero deforestation) any less concerned about the fate of the world's poorest people than I am. But their uncompromising advocacy of the zero deforestation position leaves no room for manoeuvre - even in a country like Liberia, still heavily forested in comparison to the UK and practically every other EU country, and now, it seems, forever chronically poor.A global definition of Sustainable Palm OilSomewhere in the mix of the IPOP pledge, Sir Porritts on-going study on forests and the originator of the term \"sustainable palm oil\" the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, is a standard for sustainable palm oil that will be true to the word \"sustainable.\"This sustainable oil will be an affordable cooking oil to poor people in underdeveloped countries while allowing some of them to improve their livelihoods by creating their own small plantations. The same oil will be an important option for energy for us if we ever wean ourselves from fossil fuels. Orangutans can continue to share this earth with us as the case of Sarawak has shown. In a mostly degraded environment, they continue to exist and the hope now is that new conservation efforts will increase their populations.IPOP signatory Wilmar Group has taken a leading positionn on the issue of small farmers in Sarawak by saying that it will:be developing a programme with various stakeholders to help local smallholders and farmers develop their native customary land responsibly, irrespective of whether \"it is peatland or not, as we understand that indigenous communities depend on this land for their livelihood.The IPOP agenda should follow that of Sarawak. Step back, hold off on expansions and take a good look at what needs to be done to address the needs of local peoples and conservation rather than focus on zero deforestation exclusively. Riau province which has suffered intensive deforestation for palm oil and paper could surely use focussed attention. With the influence they have, IPOP signatories can play a huge role to assure the long term survival of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan while helping to eradicate poverty in Indonesia."}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Unwanted Pets Dumped On 'Dead Dog Beach'", "text": ""}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Unwanted Pets Dumped On 'Dead Dog Beach'", "text": ""}, {"title": "Charlie The Dog Maybe Doesn't Want A New Human In His Life (VIDEO)", "text": "We get it, Charlie: dealing with change can be hard.

The Huffington Post's Sam Stein asked Kerry in an interview Thursday whether green-lighting Shell's plans as both Kerry and Obama highlighted the urgency of action on climate change sent a \"mixed message.\"\"Not really,\" said Kerry, noting that Shell's leases were initially granted before Obama became president. \"So the leases existed, and Shell and other companies are going to be drilling somewhere over the course of these next years, because we're not going to suddenly be weaned from oil.\"Kerry also said that the oil off the coast of Alaska is \"a cleaner oil than others\" -- which could be interpreted as a dig at Canada's oil sands, which have a higher greenhouse gas footprint than conventional crude. Whether or not to approve the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline to transport Canada's oil to Texas refineries is another major decision facing the Obama administration.While the U.S. needs to cease its reliance on carbon-based energy \"in the long run,\" ending dependence on oil would not be an immediate possibility, Kerry said. \"I think in terms of our efforts to begin the move to a de-carbonized economy, it's going to take 20, 30, 40 years,\" he said. \"I'd rather have our supply come from an American-controlled source in that respect than somewhere else.\"Kerry did acknowledge that the pace of action on climate change has been too slow, but cited the fact that most of the progress during the Obama administration has come through executive order, rather than through Congress, where some members have been reluctant \"to even believe it's happening.\"\"We have to do it much faster than we are right now,\" said Kerry. \"The president understands that, I understand that.

But now the local government is proposing to kill them.The plan is laid out in a draft Wildlife Action Plan, put out last month by the District Department of the Environment, that designates feral cats as an \"invasive species.\"There's also a call in the proposed plan for \"revisiting\" a longstanding program through which the Washington Humane Society -- D.C.'s city shelter -- gives the cats veterinary care, and then returns most of them back to their colonies.It's making folks who love cats worry that a return to the bad old days of euthanizing Washington's feral cats instead of caring for them may be at hand.Giacoppo said that WHS was not consulted about the draft plan -- which he calls \"poor policy\" of dubious efficacy. WHS president Lisa LaFontaine laid out her critique of the DDOE proposal in this sharp letter, which criticizes the idea that killing feral cats is an effective way of reducing the cat population or of helping the city's other animals.WHS performs all of D.C.'s animal control services and would be charged with carrying out the new plan. The Washington Humane Society's current TNR program, which began in 2006, is funded entirely through donations and grants.\"Doing away with an effective policy, a humane policy, a free policy, and replace it with a proven ineffective policy, a costly to the taxpayer policy, and an inhumane policy?\" Giacoppo said. \"I just don't get it.

Eight hundred fifty-six of these were made available for adoption; the rest were returned back to their outdoor homes. Without TNR in a year with similar numbers, more than 1,500 cats would have been euthanized.WHS and other cat-loving groups are asking supporters to let the D.C. government know their thoughts about this plan. DDOE is accepting public comments until Sept. 7.But even if the proposal goes through, Giacoppo is having a hard time imagining who would suddenly be willing to turn over the cats in their neighborhood \"and bring them in to be killed,\" he said. \"Very few people.\"This story has been updated to include Lisa LaFontaine's letter.Also on The Huffington Post:"}, {"title": "SpongeBob, BBC Earth Join Forces To Share An Important Message", "text": "BBC Earth has teamed up with SpongeBob SquarePants to teach us all a little something about one of life’s most indispensable, and overlooked, creatures -- plankton.In the video above, watch as SpongeBob’s enemy, the curmudgeonly Sheldon J.

To make matters worse, a few of the hikers were climbing a waterfall at the time -- putting them in the worst possible place to face the onslaught of water.Watch as the water quickly overtakes one of the hikers, forcing him over the edge of the waterfall and into the pool below:\"There was no other option in my mind,\" Renee Lusano, one of the hikers, later wrote on her blog, \"than that I had just seen our friend disappear and be killed, and there was nothing we could do about it.\"Thankfully, Lusano's initial impression was wrong.

They were unaware of the potential for flooding in that area.\"Without warning there was an enormous rush of water coming over the waterfall,\" Lusano wrote. \"It had to have been instantly 50 times as much water rushing over.\"Once the group escaped to higher ground, they were able to call 911 and were soon airlifted out of the area by an emergency search and rescue team.\"My five friends and I learned firsthand that flash flooding in Maui streams is a very serious danger,\" Lusano wrote of the experience. \"I hope that our story and video spreads awareness and prevents similar rescues from having to take place in the future.\"Hawaii, with its volatile weather patterns, can be a dangerous place for visitors who see it as a tropical playground.

Their goal? To investigate some of the Hawaiian archipelago's most remote and unexplored waters.The photos and videos they've captured thus far are nothing short of magnificent.Using remotely operated vehicles launched from NOAA's 224-foot Okeanos Explorer ship, the operation crew is exploring the waters in and around the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. They're also investigating Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, as well as the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary.“These areas represent some of the last relatively pristine marine ecosystems on the planet,” said Holly Bamford, assistant NOAA administrator for the National Ocean Service, in a July statement.Best of all, NOAA is live-streaming its exploration through the end of September, allowing the public to join in on the fun miles below the surface.On Thursday, the research team wrapped up the third of four mission legs with a dive around the USS S-19, a decommissioned Navy submarine that was sunk off the coast of Hawaii in 1938. As the remotely operated vehicle cruised around the coral-covered sub, one scientist asked the cameraman to zoom in on a bright red-and-orange fish in the sea toad family that was resting on the hull.\"Fish love their history,\" someone joked. \"They really appreciate it.\"After some discussion of the animal's awkward features -- including its fuzzy nose and apparently \"poor hygiene\" -- someone else said, \"He's got an expression on his face that says 'How long do I have to put up with this abuse?'\"The goals of the Hohonu Moana mission include identifying and characterizing vulnerable marine habitats and collecting information on the complex geological history of the Central Pacific seamounts.“Given the unexplored nature of these areas, their remoteness and their known status as biodiversity hotspots, I’d be very surprised if we didn’t see many animals and phenomena that are new to science,” said Christopher Kelley, expedition science team lead and an associate professor of biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in the same July statement.NOAA says the work around Johnston Atoll will be the largest scientific effort conducted there since President Barack Obama expanded the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument one year ago.See below for more otherworldly critters photographed during the Hohonu Moana expedition."}, {"title": "Native American Spirit Camp Awaits New Keystone XL Pipeline Decision", "text": "With President Obama expected to give a final decision on the Keystone XL pipeline sometime this Labor Day weekend, the company behind the pipeline and people throughout the affected states anxiously await the verdict.Back in February, President Obama vetoed a bill that would have approved the pipeline's construction. In March, members of the Senate attempted to override that veto, but they failed. Some Americans cheered; others sneered; and many assumed that was the end of the Keystone XL. Now TransCanada Corp. and the people of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska will get a new update from the State Department and Obama.Because the proposed pipeline would cross an international border (between the U.S. and Canada), the State Department coordinates a required government-wide review. If they recommend approval, TransCanada could receive its coveted presidential permit to build the pipeline.Typically, the government takes about a year and a half to make a decision on such applications. The Keystone XL permit has taken more than five times the average. Trapped in political turmoil, it has raised outcries from environmentalists, energy advocates, Republicans, and Democrats since 2009.  In South Dakota, which the Keystone XL pipeline would cross, a Spirit Camp of teepees set up in opposition to the project stands strong.  \"We're still here, and we're going to be here until that pipeline is rejected,\" says Leota Eastman-Iron Cloud, a Rosebud Sioux native who has lived at the camp for nearly two years. In doing so, she has set aside her own needs and time with family. Some days, she says she goes without food in solidarity with the people she has seen go hungry on the reservation.  \"It's all about prayer. Our prayers are powerful. Our prayers are all we have,\" she says.  Members of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe put up the teepees just north of Winner, South Dakota in March 2014. They stand under the name Oyate Wahacanka Woecun--Lakota for \"Shielding the People.\"  The teepees create a sacred space for people opposed to the pipeline's construction for various reasons, primarily environmental and public safety concerns. At the Spirit Camp, the people can pray, rally, and offer support and education to other concerned citizens.\"The people who come here from all over the world bring so much powerful energy and prayers. That's why we say 'mitakuye oyasin.' We're all related--the insects, the rocks, the animals, the plants,\" Eastman-Iron Cloud says.  The journey hasn't been easy, she adds. The camp has survived subzero temperatures, battering rain and winds, and blistering heat. \"We think about our future generations and water, and that's what keeps us going. TransCanada wants us to give up, but we're not going anywhere.\"  The Interveners and TransCanada In late July, representatives from TransCanada traveled to South Dakota for a week of public hearings. The company not only needs a presidential permit from the national government, but a renewed construction permit from the state of South Dakota.  South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) will ultimately decide if the state will renew TransCanada's permit. TransCanada must prove that it followed the PUC's regulations since the commission first granted the original construction permit in 2010.  Some 400 people marched through the South Dakota state capitol of Pierre leading up to the hearings. And more than 30 people--Native American tribal members, landowners, members of Dakota Rural Action, and lawyers--stood up in court against TransCanada. They were dubbed \"the interveners.\"  Eastman-Iron Cloud attended the hearings and says, \"The interveners' words were straight up truth, just the facts. They went face-to-face with TransCanada. We wanted a constant presence of people, just like we're doing here (at the Spirit Camp). Our water is the importance of all of this. That day, I heard one of the TransCanada people say that pipeline will cross 300 tributaries in South Dakota alone.\"  One of the interveners' main concerns was that TransCanada had purchased all of the pipe to build the pipeline sometime in 2010 or 2011, according to the DeSmogBlog Project, which reported in-depth about the hearings. For two and a half years, the pipe sat in piles outdoors in North Dakota, exposed to extreme heat and cold. The National Association of Pipe Coating Applicators recommends protecting piping left above ground within six months.  The interveners argued that in part because of the way the pipe was stored the Keystone XL will not be the safest pipeline ever built, as TransCanada has claimed. They also raised concerns over ongoing federal investigations into the pipeline's southern half, renamed the Gulf Coast Pipeline, and other TransCanada pipelines.  In closing arguments on Aug. 6th, the lawyers on the side of the interveners called for the PUC to make a decision then and there, but TransCanada objected. Eastman-Iron Cloud and others continue to wait for a decision--from the PUC and President Obama.  \"I've been bothering Obama every day on Twitter,\" Eastman-Iron Cloud says. \"It's a waiting game. Patience really is a virtue.\"  Regardless of the outcome, she adds, \"We will never forget what TransCanada is trying to do. If they dig a hole into Grandmother Earth, we'll be there.\""}, {"title": "Horton Hears a Who (Again)", "text": "One of my favorite Dr. Seuss books is a story about an elephant named Horton who hears a speck of dust calling to him, a speck that turns out to be a tiny imperiled planet with a town called Whoville. The mayor of Whoville implores Horton to save them and Horton agrees to protect the tiny planet, believing and repeating his mantra that \"a person's a person, no matter how small.\"Horton faces enormous ridicule when he tries to enlist other animals to help him. Not content to let him save the world and the people on it, these animals actively try to destroy the speck that Horton carefully carries around. As the situation in Whoville deteriorates, the citizens of Whoville begin to scream, \"We are here. We are here,\" in the hope that the deniers will listen. Despite their best efforts, the people of Whoville cannot make enough noise and it looks like it's over. In a last minute save, the Mayor of Whoville finds his son, the town's slacker JoJo, and takes him to the Eiffleberg Tower. JoJo lets out a scream and Horton's tormentors finally hear the Whos and agree to help Horton save the planet.The book was written in 1954, years before the words climate change were written, yet no one failed to catch his drift even back then. In his view and in the eyes of many, our tiny world was in danger, and no one was listening. The issues had different names, less clear science, and fewer and less powerful deniers. And despite the passage of time, 62 years after Horton first appeared, the situation is pretty much the same.In the modern day version of the story, however, the deniers are organized and efficient. Like the Chairman of Whoville, who declares that \"Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville. It never has, and never will. You blathering boob,\" deniers know that the number one way to preserve the status quo is to bully, lie, obfuscate and distract. Why do they do this? Not because they are uneducated, stupid, or nonbelievers. In fact, the leaders of the climate deniers' movement know that climate is real and that the world's systems are deteriorating. The reason they lie and obfuscate is to confuse the people of Whoville. Denying gives them time, it allows them to preserve the status quo so they can maintain power and make money. It is as simple as that.   Enter a modern day Horton. Like Horton, Pope Francis has heeded the calls of the residents of Whoville. He believes that the earth is imperiled and that it is urgent. Above all, Pope Francis believes that \"a person's a person, no matter how small,\" that we all matter. He is coming to Washington, D.C. and will speak to a joint session of Congress on the 24th encouraging disbelievers to take a leap of faith and heed the words of his encyclical.Below the Capitol steps, a fancy ticketed event will be played out on the West Lawn, full of donors and the power brokers. But beyond them on the National Mall, possibly hundreds of thousands of Whoville residents will be there, including the faithful, survivors of climate disasters, immigrants who are seeking a home, poor people who just want to succeed, and the increasing numbers of disenfranchised, all hoping to be heard from the bottom of the Hill on our tiny imperiled planet. We expect that the Pope will appear on the steps of the Capitol. When he steps out there we will be waiting. Heeding the Pope's words, we will be shouting, hoping to convince the nonbelievers and deniers that they should try to save Whoville, and letting them know that we are here. We are here."}, {"title": "How Many Trees Does Earth Have? New Study Yields Big Surprise", "text": "If you're having trouble seeing the forest for the trees, maybe it's because there are so many trees out there. A new study puts the number at 3.04 trillion trees -- a number that's much, much higher than what scientists had expected.\"We were astonished, simply because this is such an astronomical number,\" Dr. Tom Crowther, a post-doctoral fellow at Yale University's School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and the leader of the international team of scientists who did the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The previous estimate, which was solely based on satellite information, was approximately 400 billion, so we were surprised to find that our final number had 12 zeroes after it. The scale of this number really puts a lot of things in context.\"As we all know, trees add oxygen to the atmosphere and thus help produce the air we breathe. But if you think the existence of so many trees means we needn't worry so much about pollution, get this: the study also showed that 15 billion trees are cut down every year and that the total number of trees has dropped by around 46 percent since the dawn of civilization. Yikes.(Story continues below image.)For the study, the researchers used satellite data and environmental data as well as so-called \"forest inventories,\" tree tallies created by humans actually counting trees.But what exactly counts as a tree? The researchers defined \"tree\" as a woody plant that, at breast height, has a stem that's at least 10 centimeters in diameter, The Washington Post reported.The researchers found that the highest densities of trees are located in the boreal forests in the sub-arctic regions of Russia, Scandinavia, and North America. The largest forested areas, according to the researchers, are in the tropics. These areas are home to about 43 percent of the world’s trees.\"That is truly an amazing amount of field data,\" Dr. Marc Simard, a senior scientist in the Radar Science and Engineering section of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved with the study, told the Los Angeles Times. \"And it enables the discovery of relationships between tree density, remote sensing measurements and environmental factors.\"The researchers said theirs is the most comprehensive assessment of tree populations yet, and that it can help bring a better understanding of how humans affect the global environment and biodiversity.\"The information that we provide is important because it provides meaningful numbers that can be used by scientists, policy makers and environmental practitioners in order to make decisions about the world,\" Crowther said in the email. \"Trees are some of the most prominent organisms on Earth and they characterize every terrestrial ecosystem that they are found in. Understanding their distribution is important for understanding the global ecosystem.\"The study was published online in the journal Nature on September 2, 2015."}, {"title": "Fighting Back Against FirstEnergy's Coal Bailout", "text": "Have I got a deal for you! How would you like an investment that promises you a guaranteed return on your equity of more than 11 percent, no matter what happens in the marketplace or how the company's product actually performs? Believe it or not, that's exactly the kind of sweetheart deal that FirstEnergy is trying to lock in for the next 15 years for its aging power plants, on the backs of Ohio electricity customers.I traveled to Columbus this week for the start of six weeks of hearings at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), where FirstEnergy is seeking a bailout for three coal plants and a nuclear plant, all of which compete poorly in a competitive market against cleaner sources of energy like wind. I was there both because there's a lot at stake in this case for Ohio - a lot of air and water and climate pollution, customer dollars, and clean energy opportunity - and also because it's a bellwether that has national implications for a coal industry at the crossroads.Over the past year, our Ohio Beyond Coal team has been fighting proposals from the state's largest utility companies to seek customer-funded bailouts of dirty and outdated coal plants. After the state utilities commission denied two previous, similar proposals from Duke and AEP, FirstEnergy's scheme is the most egregious we've seen yet, with a projected loss of $3 billion to customers. It would literally guarantee profits for the company's shareholders until 2031 while saddling the expected cost of maintaining inefficient and polluting coal plants entirely on their customers. FirstEnergy already attempted to eliminate the competition by scuttling the state's clean energy standard, which is now suspended, but these plants still can't compete.David Roberts of Vox summed it up well, in his excellent new post about the whole debacle: \"The company can't sell its product on a competitive market, so it's asking the state to force customers to buy it. For fifteen years.\"But thanks to hard-working Beyond Coal activists, including our friends at Earthjustice, Ohioans aren't buying FirstEnergy's rhetoric about this plan -- and neither is the media. Numerous newspaper editorial boards have called this plan a sham. Just look at some of these columns and news articles - like this quote from the Toledo Blade:The subsidy proposal amounts to FirstEnergy's concession that the affected plants can't compete in the state's energy market. That failure shouldn't be borne by ratepayers or employers who may be forced to choose between keeping jobs and paying higher energy bills....While President Obama's new Clean Power Plan focuses on renewable energy and enhanced efficiency nationwide, Ohio continues to move in the opposite direction and maintain its over-reliance on fossil fuels. The FirstEnergy proposal, if approved, would widen that gap.Recently it emerged that should costs soar unexpectedly in the next 15 years for FirstEnergy's last coal-fired power plant in Ohio or its Davis-Besse nuclear plant, customers rather than the company would be stuck paying the extra bills under the utility's proposed rate plan.Monday's first hearing started off with this great column by Ohio Sierra Club's own Daniel Sawmiller.FirstEnergy has a history of making bad bets and then losing big. Ohio families and businesses shouldn't be forced to underwrite their gambles, and our communities certainly shouldn't be responsible for bailing out their bad business decisions. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio should protect Ohio's electricity customers and stay the course in rejecting these misguided attempts at corporate welfare.The FirstEnergy hearings will continue for some time. While this campaign is far from over - we are also ramping up the pressure for an even larger bailout request from AEP pending before the PUCO after this one wraps up - we have a solid team making sure that FirstEnergy is held accountable. While I was in Columbus, I was struck by both the pivotal role our advocacy plays, and the dedication of the team doing the work.The coal industry's strategy for keeping its iron grip on the electric sector for the past century has been rigging the game in their favor in the marketplace, whether that meant skirting worker protections or the violating the most rudimentary environmental standards (for example, blowing up mountains). So now that coal is facing serious financial headwinds, the industry is trying again to doing what it has always done - using its clout and connections to rig the game and insulate itself from change.And if it weren't for the advocates drawing a line in the sand, both inside and outside the hearing room, the utility would have its way, something they have freely enjoyed in the byzantine world of utility commission proceedings for decades, until the rush to build 200 coal plants brought advocates into those venues, in a new way. And we're still there.This is expected to be a six-week-long proceeding (to be immediately followed by another one of similar length for AEP), and while FirstEnergy can rotate out its battalion of corporate lawyers, we have a small contingent of dedicated experts - including attorneys from Earthjustice and Sierra Club - who are moving into hotels, giving up their lives, and doing sophisticated, exhausting work. They are my heroes.We plan on defeating this boondoggle, just as we have with the previous two utilities that tried and failed to chain the state to the past. And we've also got our eye on the AEP proceeding ahead, including pushing for more details about AEP's plans and preparing for upcoming public hearings, where customers will get to voice their opinion on AEP's next proposed coal bailout. Ohioans should be enjoying the benefits of a clean energy economy, rather than being forced to foot the bill for dirty, outdated coal plants.TAKE ACTION: Don't let FirstEnergy get a bailout!"}, {"title": "Open Letter to Starbucks: Your \"Green\" Straws Make Mermaids Cry", "text": "Dear Starbucks, I am a real mermaid, not just a graphic on a plastic cup.

Starbucks is undeniably one of the greatest sources of those straws and stirrers, along with plastic cups which come in at Number 5 most polluting and plastic lids at Number 3 most polluting. Not something to brag about, but to change. Why not be truly green and replace those plastic, nonrecyclable, everlasting straws with paper ones and only offer upon request? Most adults are fully capable of drinking without a straw. Why not ask customers if they would prefer to enjoy their coffee from a real cup if they are planning to stay? Starbucks customers who stay and enjoy their drinks in the cafe are served in to-go cups with plastic lids unless they specifically request a ceramic cup, as I do.

This year in Paris has to be the year that the world finally acts to protect the one planet that we have while we still can.\"On the three-day Alaska trip, Obama is experiencing firsthand the impacts of rapidly melting Arctic ice, which is warming waters that affect local fishing economies and raising sea levels, threatening the state's coastal villages. To help address some of these local issues, Obama announced new initiatives. One is fish and wildlife cooperation management to help rebuild Chinook salmon stocks. Another is an exchange program that brings urban and rural youth together to understand the challenges of a changing Arctic and the potential for local solutions against the impacts of climate change.Despite this focus on climate, Obama is receiving criticism for granting Royal Dutch Shell permits to drill for oil off Alaska's coast. In an op-ed, Greenpeace Executive Director Annie Leonard writes \"we commend the president for his leadership, and yet this trip comes on the heels of his administration's decision to allow Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, a move that seriously undermines his climate legacy.\"Obama addressed these criticisms last weekend.\"I know there are Americans who are concerned about oil companies drilling in environmentally sensitive waters,\" said Obama. \"Some are also concerned with my administration's decision to approve Shell's application to drill a well off the Alaskan coast, using leases they purchased before I took office. That's precisely why my administration has worked to make sure that our oil explorations conducted under these leases is done at the highest standards possible, with requirements specifically tailored to the risks of drilling off Alaska.\"The Chukchi and Beaufort seas could hold as much as 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The fact remains, said Shell President Marvin Odum that oil will continue to be needed as the United States transitions to renewable energy sources.Sea Level Rise Accelerating as Ice Sheets MeltThe impacts of sea level rise could be greater than worst-case scenarios. The reason? The dominant climate models don't fully account for the accelerated loss of ice sheets and glaciers, a phenomenon highlighted by scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) last week.Recent data on the speed and scope of melting ice sheets in Greenland and parts of Antarctica suggest that global average sea level rise may approach or exceed 1 meter, or 3.3 feet, by 2100.\"The ice sheets are contributing to sea level rise sooner and greater than anticipated,\" said Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California-Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Right now, the contribution is about one third. We know that in future warming (melting ice sheets) will dominate sea level rise. With future warming we may have multiples of 6 meters, or 18 feet, and higher. It may be a half meter per century or several meters per century, we don't know. We've never seen an ice sheet collapse before.\"Rignot drew attention to the dynamic behavior of the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, which recently lost a chunk of ice roughly 12 square kilometers in surface area and which could raise sea level by half a meter if it were to melt entirely.NASA is beginning a three-year effort, Oceans Melting Greenland, to understand the role of ocean currents and ocean temperatures in melting Greenland's ice from below -- and therefore to better predict the speed at which that melting will raise sea level.Also of concern: Antarctica, which has a great deal of total ice to lose. The West Antarctica ice sheet may be undergoing a marine instability as warm water reaches the base of its glaciers from below.\"Given what we know now about how the ocean expands as it warms and how ice sheets and glaciers are adding water to the seas, it's pretty certain we are locked into at least 3 feet of sea level rise, and probably more,\" said Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"But we don't know whether it will happen within a century or somewhat longer.\"Data collected by NASA satellites, which change position in relation to one another as Earth's water and ice realign and change gravity's pull, reveal that the ocean's mass is increasing, translating to a global sea level rise of about 0.07 inches per year, but that rise is not uniform.A visualization released by NASA illustrates the variation in sea level rise around the world. Although the sea level has fallen slightly along the U.S. west coast due to a cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), NASA warns that sea level rise could increase on that coast because the PDO recently shifted into a warm phase.Delegates Divided Ahead of Paris Climate ConferenceThis week, delegates met in Bonn, Germany, to take steps to create a workable draft for a deal slated to be negotiated at the Conference of the Parties November 30 to December 11 in Paris that would commit all nations to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The hope is that the agreement will show just how much pollution will be cut and exactly how much money rich nations will offer poorer countries to deal with their own growing energy and climate adaptation needs. Opinions on how to get to this agreement, which would take effect in 2020, differ.One particularly sticky point: how to divide responsibility for carbon cuts between rich and poor nations. In an interview with Politico, Robert Orr, a longtime climate advisor to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, identified the outstanding issues.\"The overall question of ambition, just how ambitious an agreement this will be,\" said Orr. \"Everyone agrees we need to get ourselves on a pathway to 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise or less. This level of ambition will require changes in everyone's economies, everyone's fuel mixes, everyone's infrastructure investments. So, agreeing on a level of ambition in as much specificity as possible is critical to a successful deal. The issue of financing: All of this has to be paid for.\"The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each Thursday by Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions."}, {"title": "The Pastime of Psychopaths", "text": "What kind of person enjoys taking another living being's life? It may seem improbable at first glance, but what if the same twisted psychology that drives a man to maim, stalk and--an agonizingly painful 40 hours later--shoot a lion to death might also drive a man to break into a house and plunge a knife into the people found inside? Such killers hide in plain sight. They are military officials and Boy Scout leaders. Gynecologists and dentists.Serial killing and trophy hunting are terrifyingly similar. As wildlife researcher and author Gareth Patterson* points out, both types of killers often immerse themselves in violent imagery. Hunting magazines are designed to titillate hunters and help fuel violent fantasies of stalking and killing prey. They are full of pictures of hunters standing victoriously over animals they have slain, the obvious message: Kill something--or, rather, someone--and you, too, can achieve greatness.Similarly, serial killers often draw inspiration from bondage pornography. Dennis Rader was obsessed with violent images of men dominating women, and he used them to fuel his fantasies of tying up and killing women. Eventually, fantasy made way for real life. The same has been true for other killers, like Ted Bundy.Patterson notes that both types of killers enjoy the excitement of planning their kills and building anticipation while they stalk their eventual victims more than the actual act of killing. And how many times have you heard hunters say, \"It's more about the hunt than the kill\"? They describe in detail their love of being outdoors, seeing their intended prey for the first time, tracking them down, cornering them and conquering them. Perhaps, like many serial killers, they've actually become addicted to the adrenalin rush they get from controlling their victims' fates.According to John Douglas, one of the FBI's first criminal profilers, serial killers who take souvenirs from their victims do so to prolong their violent fantasies. Some take jewelry or locks of hair, while others take photographs or body parts. Trophy hunters proudly display their victims' severed animal heads on their walls and share photos of themselves on social media grinning beside their corpses. Like serial killers, trophy hunters are compelled to prove their status as a person who has power over life and death. Between hunts, both value their souvenirs as a way to remember the power they once held over another living being.Neither type of killer shows remorse for the killing but rather excuses the behavior as filling some sort of vague spiritual need. When selecting their victims, some hunters describe a \"tremor\" they feel when they see the \"right\" animal. They like to interpret this as nature's way of telling them they are \"supposed\" to kill that particular being.Some serial killers also believe they are instructed by a higher power to kill a particular person. Cannibal Richard Chase tried the doorknobs of strangers' houses. If he found one locked, he took this as a sign that he was not welcome and would leave the occupant alone. An unlocked door, though, was an invitation--he was \"meant\" to kill the person inside.Some hunters of animals \"graduate\" to killing people. Robert Hanson--an avid hunter with a living room full of mounted animal heads who was featured in a national hunting magazine--flew kidnapped women into the Alaskan wilderness, released them and then hunted them down. Why did he do this? Because hunting nonhuman species was no longer thrilling enough.\"[Killing people] is so much fun,\" the Zodiac Killer said in one of his letters. \"It's even better than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal.\"Both types of killers could keep their fantasies as just that--fantasies. Trophy hunters could shoot photographs rather than high-powered crossbows. But both decide--enthusiastically--to take a life in order to fulfill their own selfish desires. They plan their killing sprees carefully, and then they kill and kill again, with no sign of stopping.It's time for us to call trophy hunting what it is: the pastime of psychopaths.*Well known for his work with African lions, Gareth Patterson is an environmentalist, independent wildlife researcher, public speaker and author who has worked for more than 25 years for the increased protection of African wildlife.

Project Sunroof allows its users to determine exactly how much solar power could be generated at their address, how much it would cost, and even which local companies could install the panels.For now, the project is on trial in just three places - Boston, Fresno, and the San Francisco bay area. But by starting its endeavor in sunny California and in less sunny New England, Google illustrates an important point: with the right policies in place, going solar makes sense almost anywhere.A new report from Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group makes a similar case. The analysis, Lighting the Way III, examines solar power capacity per capita by state, highlighting the top 10.The states--Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Colorado--all have varied amounts of sunshine, but what they share in common are programs that allow increasing numbers of homeowners, businesses, and communities to install solar panels.All of these states--which make up 26 percent of the nation's population but 86 percent of its solar power capacity--have renewable energy requirements. Nine states have strong net metering policies allowing customers to get full credit for the excess power they provide to the electric grid.Two very populous states with different numbers of sunny days barely missed the top 10 per capita rankings, but have strong solar markets nonetheless. New York has seen dramatic solar energy growth as a result of strong policy support from the Cuomo Administration. Texas has benefited from local solar energy policies in cities such as Austin and San Antonio.  The top 10 states, along with New York and Texas have been at the leading edge of the nation's rapid development of solar energy, which has tripled in the last three years and is adding jobs much faster than the overall economy, employing 173,000 workers across the country.Despite the nationwide solar boom, a concerted push by utilities and their allies to weaken local clean energy laws is gaining traction, even in the nation's leading states for solar. Arizona slipped from first in 2013 to eighth in 2014 for installations of new solar energy capacity per capita, as new fees levied on solar customers in much of the state dampened demand for solar energy. Renewable energy laws are under attack in North Carolina, New Mexico, and elsewhere.But other top 10 solar states are doubling down on their support for clean energy. In June, Hawaii passed the nation's first 100 percent renewable electricity standard. Three days later, Vermont passed a 75 percent renewable electricity standard with the nation's strongest solar requirement.Solar power is poised to play a major role--in the top 10 states and elsewhere--in the implementation of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which sets state-by-state limits on carbon pollution from coal and gas plants and was finalized last month. Our research shows that if solar power continues to grow at only a fraction of its recent rate, the pollution-free source could meet half of the pollution-reduction goals laid out in the plan.The biggest step our country has ever taken to address climate change is possible in large part because of solar power's incredible potential. But we can't stop there. To slow global warming and ensure a healthier planet for future generations, states that follow the lead of those featured in our report can chart the course to 100 percent clean energy, with solar panels as universal as Google."}, {"title": "Climate Truth, Justice, and the American Way", "text": "The overwhelming scientific consensus is that humans are warming our planet by burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees. 97% of climate scientists agree about this. But the agreement doesn't stop there; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also went to a lot of effort to create equally strong reports about who will be hurt worst, and it turns out, climate impacts are not distributed equally across all of humanity. Climate change is being caused by the richest humans and the impacts will be borne largely by the poorest. This, of course, is not news to anyone thinking about it for a minute, especially those of us who recently marked the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall with grim remembrance of some of the disparities in who is most vulnerable during and after disasters.Unlike Pope Francis, who eloquently casts climate change as a moral battle, a matter of justice for the poor, in his recent encyclical, Laudato Si, the scientific community never actually comes right out and says this is a matter of right and wrong. Instead, the IPCC says things like:\"People who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized are especially vulnerable to climate change and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses.\"--- which is, arguably, scientist-speak for \"this is totally just not fair at all, you guys.\"So what are we to do? And must we remain solemnly grim and horrified while doing it?It's possible I may be biased, because my personal fight for climate justice has led to lots of silliness, laughs, and even wearing a cape from time to time. This is not typical. But our latest video in the Don't Just Sit There - Do Something! series points out that when it comes to climate change, while there really is a right and a wrong course of action, heroes and villians -- we can choose inspiration over despair. It's up to us to become the heroes that we're looking for.I know that, especially as a U.S. resident who is thankfully not hurting for basic necessities, some climate-friendly changes are easier and faster to make than others. Recently, my family took a big step that was a long time coming, buying a used Chevy Volt. For years, we've known our next car would be electric, and the day finally came. Unsolicited, unsponsored review? It's GREAT, and honestly, the personal benefits far outweigh the peace of mind that I get from knowing my carbon footprint is that much lower. I mean, it's no invisible jet, but driving the Volt is smooth and quiet and really, genuinely fun. Even the 2012 model makes you feel like you live in the future. Or at least, like you live in a future you'd approve of. One that protects not only the weakest among us, but also all future generations.Personal changes and policy changes (like the recently finalized, historic Clean Power Plan to reduce climate pollution from the U.S. power sector) are what will get us to that better future, for everyone.

The shotgun blast struck the two cubs, fatally striking one and seriously wounding the other.Officers with Colorado Parks and Wildlife who responded to the scene later put down the wounded cub. The sow climbed a nearby tree where she perched for several hours before returning to the woods, the sheriff's office said.Shotgun pellets also broke the window of a nearby \"occupied house,\" authorities said.The misdemeanor charges include three counts of hunting black bears out of season, two counts of illegal possession of wildlife and one count of shooting from a public road, the district attorney's statement said.Colorado has about 19,000 black bears. Heavy spring rains and a late hard frost have led to a lack of the bruins' staple foods, serviceberry and chokecherry bushes, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill said.The wild crop shortage has forced the bears to move into human populated areas to search for food, Churchill said, leading to an increase in the number of bears spotted in several cities in eastern Colorado, including Denver and its suburbs.Wildlife officials said people can ward off bears with non-lethal means, such as banging on pots and pans or blowing an air horn.If convicted of the felony charges, Williams faces a maximum 4-1/2 years in prison, prosecutors said, and separately the misdemeanor counts carry \"a potential county jail sentence and significant fines.\"An initial court date will be set for Williams once he is served with the felony warrant, prosecutors said.(Reporting by Keith Coffman; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Sandra Maler)"}, {"title": "Heartbreaking Photographs Show How We're Ruining The Pacific Ocean", "text": "Mankind dumps millions of tons of plastic into our oceans every year.

Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.Answer by John Buginas, SF/SPCA Academy for Dog Trainers, instructor, 2006-2009, CTC 2005:All dogs are different. Like people, most dogs will \"tell you\" if they don't like what you are doing. They can't talk, so they will tell you by flinching or moving away, punching you with their noses, or growling. As with people, your relationship will go best if you respect their boundaries and respect their personal space. And, as with people, once a dog is familiar with you, the two of you will learn how you can interact and have fun together.Take your cues from what dogs do when they meet and play. Try not to get caught up in speculation about dominance or pack leader or try to be the alpha dog. Keep your eyes and ears open and watch what the dog is doing. If the dog freezes, stops breathing, starts to move stiffly, stares at you with dilated pupils (\"hard eye\"), or the hair on their back stands up, slow down! Your attentions are not wanted. A happy dog will approach you, move fluidly, wiggle, and avoid direct eye contact.If you watch dogs greet, they rarely approach face to face. They usually approach in an arc and allow each other to sniff the other's butt, then decide if they want to play. During the greeting, many dogs will go stiff, and their tails will wag stiffly, until they've made their introduction and finished sniffing each other. Initial greetings for dogs are tense until they figure out if they want to play, avoid each other, or fight. Dogs who violate the initial greeting ritual by approaching face to face; refusing the sniffing ritual; or starting to play, mouth, or jump up on another dog are acting rudely. A botched greeting can escalate into snaps and growls. Don't be that dog.A wagging tail is not always an OK thing with a dog. If the dog is moving stiffly and the tail is held stiffly upright, this is a sign the dog is tense. If the tail is wagging in huge circles, like a helicopter in big, loose motions, and the entire back end of the dog is wiggling, the dog is likely relaxed.It's best to crouch to get down to the dog's level (if that's easy for you), turned slightly to the side. Don't approach head-on; let the dog approach you. When you reach your hand out, do so slowly, palm up, from a low position. Don't move your hand high, in a big arc, or approach their head. Let the dog sniff you--it's part of the ritual. (You don't have to reciprocate). Most dogs don't like to have you pat the top of their heads or to have hands approach their heads from on high. Most will like to have hands placed on their sides or backs.Pay attention to what the dog in front of you does. It doesn't matter what your last dog-friend let you do to it; it's the dog in front of you that matters. Every dog is different. Some have parts of their bodies that they don't want touched. Stop what you are doing if the dog stiffens or rapidly pokes you with its nose. A nose-poke is a warning and is the closest thing a dog can do to politely saying \"NO!\" Think of a nose-poke as saying, Hey, stop that. Look, I can reach your hand with my mouth full of teeth. I'm giving you a warning.Many dogs will maneuver themselves to a position so your hand is where they want to be petted.

Critics are skeptical saying the agreement will be harmful to the environment and economically benefits large corporations.The United States is currently negotiating the trade deal, which will impact every textile sector including yarns, fabrics, fibers, apparel, and home furnishings. The agreement is intended to remove trade barriers, including tariffs between the participating countries. TPP has 12 participating countries, including five from the Americas (Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the US), five from Asia (Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam), as well as Australia and New Zealand. The proponents of the TPP are mainly large corporations, like Chevron and Pacific Rim. Opponents of the TPP include a coalition, from the Citizens Trade Campaign, that sent a letter to House and Senate members, signed by more than 2,000 groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, Catholics United, Feminist Majority, Greenpeace, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Presbyterian Church (USA), the Sierra Club, 350.org and the Union of Concerned Scientists.The TPP could negatively affect the environment. According to Climate Progress, under the proposed agreement corporations may be able to use TPP's arbitration clause to sue governments that interfere with their business. This could conflict with laws enacted locally to reduce pollution and protect the environment.For example, in 2013, Chevron accused activists in Ecuador of defrauding its company, after Chevron was ordered to pay an $18.2 billion judgment for environmental contamination from oil drilling.In the 2000s, Pacific Rim, a mining company, made plans to expand to El Savador, but their plans were delayed by the country's environmental policies. Pacific Rim attacked El Salvador's mining policies under the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The company is demanding $200 million from the Salvadoran people, whose average annual income is $7,200.Lone Star Resources, a Canadian firm that incorporated in Delaware, used the dispute resolution clause in the North American Free Trade agreement to seek $250 million from the Canadian government. It was their response to a moratorium on fracking, a controversial drilling method, issued by the province of Quebec.Opponents of the provision argue that it will open the door for foreign companies or U.S. corporations with foreign interests to circumvent U.S.laws. Public Citizen reports that more than $400 million has already been paid out in investor-state cases related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for attacks on natural resource policies, toxic bans, health and safety measures, and more.The yarn-forward rule, a rule which will limit materials sourcing to countries participating in the agreement, would keep non-TPP countries, like China, from benefiting from sourcing materials for textiles to TPP countries.However, countries like Vietnam would see unprecedented growth in the garment sector. According to National Council of Textile Organizations Chairman William L. Jasper, Vietnam wants to eliminate the yarn-forward rule and this would open the door for China to benefit from the TPP. Jasper says, if the agreement gives a backdoor to China, the U.S. textile sector could lose 500,000 jobs.Forbes magazine contributor Jean-Pierre Lehmann says the TPP is just a bad idea, calling the agreement \"a geopolitical ploy\" that uses trade as a means to contain China. According to Lehman trade between the smaller countries involved in the agreement like Chile, Mexico and Peru would be minimal in proportion to their overall trade. Lehman says this makes the TPP a bi-lateral trade agreement between Japan and the U.S. He warns that such a trade partnership would be a costly mistake, and would be a stumbling block to global economic equity for developing countries.Developing countries are more apt to have cases filed against them by companies that use investor-state or dispute resolution provisions. According to Rachel Wellhausen, an international investment specialist at the University of Texas at Austin, suits against developing countries are increasing. Her research has turned up 686 investor-state dispute cases since 1990, with 147 suits brought by U.S. firms, more than from any other nation.Mohd Nizam Mahshar of Astro Awani notes that TPP is not fair or free, as it would primarily benefit American corporations. Former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad agrees. In the foreword to a publication by the Malay Economic Action Council (MTEM) entitled, TPP - Malaysia is not for sale, Mohamad asserts that trade agreements are a way to colonize other nations. Nazim says member countries of the World Trade Organization pay zero or low tariffs on Malaysian textiles. Mahshar says TPP is a way for America to exploit the resources of countries like Malaysia.This is maybe why businesses are rushing to invest in textile manufacturing in TPP signatories, like Vietnam. Foreign manufacturers have poured more than $1 billion into Vietnam's textile and apparel sector in anticipation of a TPP agreement. They see economic opportunity in the TPP.The United States alone consumes one-quarter of the world's clothes and shoes. In 2011, U.S. consumers spent close to $350 billion on new clothes and shoes, as Americans purchased an estimated 19.4 billion garments and 2.2 billion pairs of shoes. Ironically, the U.S. represents just five percent of the world's population.With such large amounts of money at stake, TPP may pose a challenge to a country like Bangladesh that is not yet a party to the agreement. Recently, international experts from the Bangladesh Development Conference at Harvard University predicted Vietnam will likely surpass Bangladesh as a global exporter by 2024 because of TPP tariff preferences and technology transfers. India may face similar challenges in TPP markets, as new trading rules erode its export market share and require higher quality standards.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative says TPP will promote job growth and boost economic opportunity, but that economic growth for a few, is likely to spell environmental and financial catastrophe for the many."}, {"title": "Controversial Philosopher Says Man And Machine Will Fuse Into One Being", "text": "Peter Sloterdijk is Germany’s most controversial thinker and media theorist. He has dared to challenge long-established divisions in traditional philosophy of body and soul, subject and object, culture and nature. His 1999 lecture on “Regulations for the Human Park,” in which he argued that genetic engineering was a continuation of human striving for self-creation, stirred up a tempest in a country known for Nazi eugenics. At the same time, he himself has concluded that \"the taming of man has failed” as civilization’s potential for barbarism has grown ever greater. His seminal books include “Critique of Cynical Reason” and his trilogy, “Spheres.”At a recent Berggruen Center on Philosophy and Culture symposium on humans and technology at Cambridge University’s St. John's School of Divinity, The WorldPost discussed with Sloterdijk the end of borders between humans and technology, the cloud, singularity and identity in the age of globalization.For years now, you have been arguing that a new type of being was coming into existence, as the human species fuses with its technological prosthetics -- “anthropo-technology.” In this new being, man and machine are becoming one integrated, operative system linked by information.All these years later, our consciousness has expanded into the cloud and the cloud into our consciousness; we have also learned to read, write and edit the genetic code, giving us the knowledge to purposively amend millennia of evolution.How does your concept of “anthropo-technology” differ, or how is it similar, to that of futurist and AI proponent Ray Kurzweil’s idea of “singularity”? Kurzweil sees not only an epistemic break with the past, but a new phase of evolution altogether that reaches beyond consciousness into being and biology.The concept of “anthropotechnics” rests on the hypothesis that the current psychophysical and social constitution of the species Homo sapiens -- note the evolutionist emphasis of this classification -- is based substantially on autogenic effects. In this context, the term “autogenic” means “brought about by the repercussions of actions on the actor.” The human being -- especially in so-called “advanced civilizations” -- is the animal that molds itself into its own pet. While evolution means adaptation to a natural environment, domestication means, from the outset, adaptation to the artificial.What we call “civilizations” in moral and cultural-theoretical terms are, from the perspective of biological anthropology (which deals with the animal/human distinction), the result of a long sequence of auto-domestications. Tens of thousands of years before the Greek oracle could write the motto “Know thyself” above the place of encounter with the truth, the great mothers, chieftains and sorcerers had applied a different one to the lives of their own kind: “Tame thyself!” This led to what would become known much later as “education” -- in Greek paideia, in Latin humanitas, in Sanskrit vinaya, in Chinese wenhua and in German Bildung.The term “anthropotechnics” points to the fact that the process of the humans’ domestication by humans, which began very early on, retains an open future. Firstly, it describes the largely unconscious secession of humans from pure animality -- whereby they became not only members of the “symbolic species,” a “ritual animal” (as Wittgenstein remarked on occasion), indeed a mythological narrative animal, but also a technical creature. Secondly, it points to future possibility of conscious self-shaping through forms of training of the mind, through chemical modifications, perhaps even through genetic impulses.The concept of “anthropotechnics” thus refers to the entire autopoiesis, or self-creation, of “mankind” in its many thousands of cultural specializations. It is empirical, pluralistic and egalitarian from the ground up -- in the sense that all individuals, as heirs to the memory of mankind, are free to surpass themselves.Ray Kurzweil’s idea of “singularity,” by contrast, contains futuristic, monistic and elitist elements. Although “singularity,” according to its logical and rhetorical design, is meant to integrate mankind as a whole, it is evident that it could only encompass a tiny group of exceptional transhuman individuals.Kurzweil argues that expanding our minds into the cloud and vice versa will create more diversity and less uniformity because we will have access to almost infinite information with which to fertilize our imagination and construct our personality. Do you agree with this line of thinking?In speaking of the “cloud,” Kurzweil positions himself in a field that is preformatted by traditional philosophy. With his concept of the “objective spirit,” Hegel outlined the formal premise of a “cloud”: these consist in the “expressions” of the spirit, which have solidified into institutions. Institutions are programs for cultural transmission handed down to future generations.It should not be especially difficult to develop the concepts of “spirit” and “institution” into the concept of the cloud. Clouds are liquidized institutions, as it were, in which the mass of prior experience that is capable and worthy of transmission is made available for later interested parties.The difference between a cloud and a school reveals itself in the fact that in the former, the autodidactic (and eo ipso auto-domesticative) factor increases -- whereas schools, as prototypes of formal institutions, are principally heterodidactic (authoritative) and conservative (hetero-domesticative) in their structures.What clouds and schools have in common is that both wrestle with a nonsense problem: schools can never be entirely sure of passing on what is worth knowing, and cloud visitors are all the more incapable of distinguishing with certainty between nonsense and no nonsense. One part of the modern-postmodern situation is the instability of the difference between institutionalized and de-institutionalized knowledge.In this respect, one must take the cloud metaphor seriously in a literal sense: clouds cover up the clear sky. The current infospheric encasement of the human field is the continuation of the “objective spirit” by other means -- and today, those are digital means.It had already become evident in the 19 century how far the “objective spirit” can transform into an ideology and communicative plague (propaganda). The first half of the 20 century belonged entirely to the conflict among (pre-digital) ideological clouds. The second half of the 20 century brought -- in the form of the Cold War -- a form of ceasefire in the war of clouds.It is unforeseeable whether the hyper-cloud of the 21 century will end the regional immersion in institutionalized untruths that was typical of the 20century. Nor do we know today whether the clear sky, or the cloud that covers it, is the information.Anyone who uses the word “cloud” in the singular risks falling prey to mystification. At present, once more, there are several cloud systems, and what we once called the Cold War now returns as the war of clouds. One of the nasty surprises of the incipient 21 century is that the demons of propaganda have returned in a digitally updated form. To counter the new empires of lie and perspectival distortion, a renewal of the idea of enlightenment is indispensable.Perhaps a better phrase than artificial intelligence would be “intelligent artifice”; and for humans in this future, “artificial humans.” In other words, the “authentic self” and being-in-the-world is no longer separated from our tools. It is “the world-in-being” as well as vice versa?“Artificial intelligence” is a hybrid term for the long-familiar phenomenon that in artifacts (tools, works and institutions), the intentions of the producers survive almost independently of their products. That is precisely what was expressed in Hegel’s concept of objective spirit. What is objective is the intelligence invested in tools, works and institutions by their producers, which subsequently separated from them to be absorbed and applied by other intelligences (subjective spirit, pupils, users).Now, Cecil Rhodes’ dictum “Expansion is all” only applies to the sphere of the political with significant qualifications. For the current worlds of money and information, by contrast, it is all the more valid. The spheres of artificial intelligence and intelligent artificiality develop of their own accord an expansionist constitution that has increasingly permeated all aspects of existence. In this sense, existence in the technical world per se is characterized by ever-greater artificialization. Modern and postmodern humans not only live in the “house of Being” (as Heidegger called language), but increasingly in the abode of the technosphere.You have noted that, since the rupture that gave birth to modernity, human civilization has moved from the era of “humanism and the nation state” to “ecology and globalization,” from the “agrarian patriotism” in which identity is tied to the earthy virtue of place to the “global self.” What is the locus of identity for the global self if it has been de-territorialized? Not in the heavens, but in the cloud?More than a few contemporary thinkers have defined the 20 century as an age of global mobilization. Actually, this period -- or rather, that beginning with the Industrial Revolution of the 18 century -- saw the dissolution of the immemorial alliance between humans and territory (Oswald Spengler spoke of culture and landscape) that had defined the age of agrarian sedentarism. Thus begins the adventure of post-sedentary life forms -- and eo ipso of liquidized identities. These not infrequently appear in a costume of nomadic romanticism. It feeds off the notion that the moderns’ constant state of transit is accompanied by the return to a deeper truth about human beings.In this respect, the philosopher Vilém Flusser probably hit the mark when he stated that humans do not necessarily belong to a territorialized nation (a “home”). This was exemplified by the Judaism of the diaspora era -- but they need at all times and in all places a suitable home in which to anchor themselves existentially. Homelessness constitutes a worse fate than statelessness. What we call a residence is the place in which one gains relief through habituation.This (Heidegger-inspired) interpretation of the human being as a residential being corresponds to the concept of “connected isolations” developed some decades ago by the American architectural firm Morphosis to describe the modus vivendi of post-sedentary “society.” The phrase points to the modern challenge of creating a balance between isolation (literally: island formation) and connectivity (context formation).Isn’t the dialectic of yearning for belonging in such a vacuum of community creating a backlash? We see it today with religious fervor and nationalism all around. Is this a search for the security of identity and recognition in the “womb” of the volk, or your “bubbles” which are the containers of identity and meaning? What ought to be the response to this new tribalism?The same applies to the traditional tension between the will to independence and the will to belong. So-called “new tribalism” is a virtually inevitable reaction to the progressive individualization of modernity. It tries to generate synthetic social bonds where the natural ones have been broken. Only future historical experience can show whether such bonds can be produced without regressive fictions.The most malign form of regressive political factionalism manifests itself today in the new terror tribes, which are termed, in some cases rightly, a return of fascism. Fascism (as it emerged in Europe in the shadow of World War I, as a rejection of demobilization) is a martial tribalism whose ambition is to reform the whole of “society” on the model of a combat league.Finally, a question on East and West in this context. You have argued that the “excess reality” mobilized by modern energies outstrips any narrative of origins and continuity that can tie a globally synchronized world together. The steady disruption of these energies has led to persistent asymmetry and disequilibrium, a lack of balance. “All that is solid melts into air.” All attempts at re-founding legitimacy and narratives of origin are frustrated.Thus, there is only a kind of corrosive entropy away from order that saps “cosmological confidence.” I wonder how true this is in China? You might say the Chinese Communist Party (like the “institutional civilization” that preceded it throughout many dynasties) sees its main task as resisting the flow of entropy by seeking to establish and maintain equilibrium -- a political rudder, so to speak, to keep the ship from capsizing amid the swells of unleashed modern energies.To do so, it aims above all to prevent any counter-hegemony (or worse, no ideological hegemony) from arising out of the chaos by grafting the narrative origins of the present system’s legitimacy and continuity -- Mao -- to the narrative of China’s millennia-long Confucian and Daoist cosmology. This bound the Chinese together as a civilization long before the nation-state and mass media.Unlike the West, in China today there seems to be a kind of inner-civilizational confidence -- not a lack of cosmological confidence -- that prevails. Perhaps the West is only experiencing something new that China has experienced over and over again for 2000 years -- many episodes of upheaving change over centuries have led to an obsession with order.China, perhaps, has learned to maintain civilizational continuity after perennial bouts of disruption. In more recent times, remember Mao: “All under the heavens are in disorder; the situation is excellent.” Mao was the deluge. Now China authorities are attempting to refound legitimacy and continuity by linking the future to the past. Circular time still maintains in China, and so does balance against asymmetry.Might all this suggest that in the East, the old patterns of symmetry, balance and circular time remain? Perhaps the “myth,” the noble lie close enough to the truth, still works in China? Maybe the modern West is just too young yet to gauge the whole picture?As a non-Sinologist and admiring observer of the “Chinese phenomenon,” I tend to be restrained with judgments about the course of events in that part of the civilization universe.It seems to me, however, that my statements about the growing asymmetries in the process of modernity are also applicable to China. China may have averted a demographic disaster in the last half-century, but its contribution to environmental disasters -- local and global -- seems immense.For the political and cultural intelligence of the future, one can say with a degree of certainty that, in the coming century, it will develop a conceptual system of coordinates based on the difference between the sustainable and the non-sustainable. It is reasonable to assume that China’s vote will be of increasing importance in this context. The rest of the world will learn to see China not only as the paradigm of cunning despotism, but also as a civilization that affords the principles of symmetry, balance, circularity and continuity an appropriate status -- in contrast to Western nations, which are less and less in control of their great experiment with asymmetry, imbalance, irreversibility and discontinuity. It could be that in the longer term, China will form the decisive counterweight to the Jurassic Park of Western modernity.At the same time, it cannot be overlooked that China itself has incorporated many motifs from the Western civilization of asymmetry. These, as China’s political leadership has evidently recognized, contain a high explosive potential. In light of this, it is a sign of the civilization-critical wisdom of tomorrow to remain alert as a “comparatist” of the Western and Eastern paths.This interview was translated by Wieland Hoban and is part of the WorldPost Series on Exponential Technology.Also on WorldPost:"}, {"title": "Politics as Usual Stifles Action on Environment", "text": "By Jordan StephenOn Monday, President Obama became the first commander-in-chief to venture into the northern reaches of Alaska to examine the visible effect climate change is having on the country.  The trip highlights the administration's desire to draw attention to climate change, an issue the President intends to bring to the forefront of the political conversation before he retires from the Oval Office.  But despite consistent public cries to address environmental issues, especially from millennials, the past decade has seen little legislative movement in the area. In fact, the last major piece of environmental law was passed in 2007, and largely focused on economic issues.  Dr. Simon Nicholson, the director of American University's Global Environmental Politics program, blames a common culprit.  \"The short answer is politics,\" Nicholson told GVH Live. \"Environmental issues have become part of our political and cultural divisions. They have become issues of ideology instead of science.\"  Climate change, pollution and conservation have all become partisan affairs. According to a survey done by Pew Research, nearly 80 percent of Democrats support stricter pollution regulation compared to only 50 percent of Republicans.  This was not always the case.  \"Many of the most robust pieces of environmental legislation was passed when Republicans controlled the White House,\" Nicholson said. \"Many called themselves conservationists. It wasn't a dirty word.\"  The strict regulatory Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were both signed into law by President Richard Nixon, a Republican known for his social conservatism and \"anti-hippie\" sentiment. Other right-wing conservationist included conservative firebrand U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  \"Flash forward to the early 1980s and the rise of Reagan,\" Nicholson said. \"Now there's a big clash between economic growth and environmental protection. Republicans know they are going to lose the environmental battle, so the Democrats are labelled 'anti-growth.'\"  This dichotomy has carried over to the present day and has virtually split the electorate into two competing camps, a division Nicholson described as \"senseless.\"Congress reflects this divide. Many Republicans in the Senate have publicly denied a relationship between human activity and climate change.   An overwhelming majority of scientific studies have found a link between the two.  With Republicans in control of both the House and the Senate, President Obama has been forced to pursue his agenda through executive action alone. Imposing stricter carbon emissions rules through the Environmental Protection Agency has been a major component of his Clean Power Plan.  Working through executive action, the Commander-in-chief can take baby steps with his agenda, but to make real progress, the President must go through Congress, a fairly bleak proposition.  As a new generation of voters and politicians come to power, however, we may be moving towards more comprehensive ecological policy.  Millennials care more about environmental issues than their older counterparts. A poll from Harstad Research found that 76 percent of 18-33 year-olds believe that the government should do more to protect the environment. Controlling pollution was their greatest regulatory concern above protecting the rights of women, workers and minorities.  While many young voters are passionate about the issue, Nicholson pressed the urgent need for immediate action.  \"Every generation faces a consequential challenge,\" he said. \"In the 1930s it was the Great Depression, in the 1940s it was World War II. This is our big thing. If we don't get this right, nothing else will matter.\""}, {"title": "Paris Carbonomics", "text": "In December of this year 196 nations will meet in Paris to close a global deal to address climate change. With less than three months, and 5 official negotiating days left before the Paris UN conference, diplomats are working out the key remaining disagreements.The major concerns revolve around money: how much responsibility rich nations will take for climate change compared to the developing countries that need to power their growing economies and populations; and how will developed nations fulfill their agreement of $100 billion per year of climate finance to begin in 2020.It's no surprise that cold hard cash is at the center of these disputes. At its core, climate change is an economic problem. Cheap and subsidized coal, oil, and gas fueled the industrial revolution and high quality of life in the West. We didn't realize until the 1960's and 1970's that there was also a huge expense we failed to foresee -- pollution and climate change.Here's an analogy to consider: The 2008 financial crisis was created by insatiable banks and mortgage brokers who offered loans with \"easy\" terms to under-qualified customers that didn't reflect the true risks involved and created a housing market bubble. When the bubble finally popped, homeowners who couldn't afford increased mortgage interest rates and small investors took the brunt of the loss.Fossil fuels are being sold at a price that doesn't reflect the true cost of their impact on the environment. Businesses, governments and even consumers are creating a \"carbon bubble\" that when it pops may have both severe financial repercussions and, if not addressed soon enough, will trigger uncontrollable climate damage. And like the housing bubble, those who will pay the most severe costs are the poor, elderly and children.Unfortunately, the 83 page draft climate agreement under negotiation does nothing to prioritize putting a price on carbon pollutants. To avoid severe climate change it's essential that the final Paris agreement makes carbon pricing a central element of the solution. It will take an economic response to address what is essentially an economic problem. Doing so will put the brunt of liability on those industries that are most responsible for the climate crises and have the greatest means of limiting damage. Rather than trying to regulate emissions reduction, a carbon price will incentivize polluters to change their ways or be forced to pay for it. A carbon price will also motivate clean technologies and new low-carbon economic growth. Currently about 40 countries and over 20 cities, states and provinces use carbon pricing mechanisms or have plans to implement them.There are basically two types of carbon pricing: emissions trade systems (ETS) and carbon taxes or fees:The climate agreements under consideration only mentions emission trading, and do so in a peripheral manner. Carbon fee should also be included as an alternative means of pricing carbon. Joe Robertson, Citizens' Climate Lobby's global strategy director, says\"Carbon pricing is about economic fairness and reliable prosperity. Right now, everything we do in the economy carries hidden costs, because we are not accounting for the true cost of how we get energy. Getting principled language to guide national policies toward more efficient low-carbon development, through effective, efficient, transparent carbon pricing, means more reliable innovation, investment, hiring and climate action, for everyone.\"An impressive group of leaders from across government, the private sector and civil society have formed the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition to ensure smart, effective carbon pricing policies are adopted. But much more needs to be done in the next few months to get carbon pricing right.A global climate change agreement without a clear economic solution to this looming problem could be too little, too late -- but there's still time to craft an efficient, effective and equitable correction to the most pressing problem of our times."}, {"title": "American Energy Alliance Leads Front Group Attack on Wind PTC", "text": "The fossil fuel-funded American Energy Alliance wrote a coalition letter signed by 20 organizations to Congress claiming widespread support for \"The PTC Elimination Act\", which would cut subsidies for wind energy production.

Costing Environmental Risks", "text": "Light reflecting, a pastel palette sea, graceful contours of the coast. These seaside pleasures we seek in our dreams, can see in our mind's eye, and now and then can afford when we buy or rent real estate. Hotels call these landscape pleasures \"premium\" and charge us handsomely for premium room attributes, even though the environment itself offers its pleasures to us free of cost. Proximity to the sea and sea views have been advantages for trade, art and culture since the beginning of human settlements -- a poetry in the landscape of where we choose to locate ourselves, and conduct commerce. And owners of land near the sea are skillful at translating the free value attached to seafront property by nature into charges they can pass along. After all, who among us checks into an hotel and asks for a room facing a wall?But, via climate change, we are nastily converting free pleasures into pending threats. Tsunamis from earthquakes are notorious, of course, but earthquakes are for the most part not human-caused. Climate change, on the other hand, derives from human activities and is underway, warming the planet here, cooling it there, but everywhere causing unpredictable and extreme weather patterns.Wild storm surges are, unfortunately, becoming a new normal, placing new demands on the insurance industry and other financial entities that have to come to terms with how to compensate and cope with ensuing damage costs -- current and projected. For what if 1 in 100 year catastrophic weather events start to occur more often? Are those costs bearable financially and operationally, let alone spiritually?On the operational side, institutions globally have had to put on a new pair of glasses to clearly see and address new potential risks. In the U.S. perhaps the most dramatic recent example is the new Whitney Museum of Art, the country's premier museum of American Art, which just moved its collection to lower Manhattan, right next to the Hudson River and a few ferry toots from its opening to the Atlantic Ocean. The Museum opening was a monumental civic affair, by Renzo Piano, and became a global architectural sensation overnight. From outside, the museum looks like a sleek steel city building that fell asleep and woke up as a ship taking to a narrow strip of water. From nearly every gallery, the Hudson River glistens, reflecting so much sunlight at times that huge scrim curtains needed to be hung to cut the glare and avoid possible light damage to the art.But what about flooding? In 2012, during infamous Hurricane Sandy, whose storm surge broke all records, lower Manhattan was underwater and blacked out, including where the Whitney now stands. Storm water made the nearby subway tunnels unusable, and rubber dinghies for a time replaced yellow cabs as a way to move around. And, frighteningly, the basement of the new Whitney site, then under construction, was itself flooded with about 15 meters of water.So, planning had to begin again, and the new Whitney design had to prepare for the worst--not just to save the building of course, but to protect the priceless art inside--the core mission and raison d'être of the Museum after all. The result is a fortress against the tempest, with an enormous flood door and heavy mobile walls that are in storage until the day they may be needed, said to be able to be erected quickly. This is as close to sealing up the museum like a submarine as is possible with today's technology. In fact, the company that helped with the design is Walz and Krenzer, with the tagline, \"Watertight closures for the Marine Industry since 1939.\"To fund the Museum, $125 million in revenue bonds were issued by the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York and recently rated \"A\" by Fitch's. Interestingly, the ratings criteria on financial viability of the Museum did not apparently include any plus or minus that would reflect the museum's storm preparedness, though presumably the extra resiliency planning should make the Museum more viable and insurable, and thus more likely to deliver on its revenue projections in that business interruption in the event of a major storm should be lessened.But no one really knows. The storm system, while state of the art, remains to be tested although no one would like to see it tested in real life. Could it be that a world class museum has been built in a flood plain?Urban resiliency and hardening of coastal locations is a hot topic worldwide today, in view of climate change, especially in Asia where memories of coastal wipe-outs are all too recent and vivid, even more especially in Hong Kong, with its superb miles of river walks, concert halls, hotels and museums along Victoria Harbor. Still, the financial services sector is perhaps playing catch-up to weather facts.In the meantime, globally, the \"1 in 100 initiative\" is underway, an effort convened by partners such as the UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, Standard and Poor's, and the Willis Group, a global risk advisor and insurance and reinsurance broker. Currently, the \"1 in 100 year\" stress test gauges disaster risk and evaluates the \"maximum probable financial loss\" an entity could expect to face in a hundred years, i.e., a one percent chance that disaster would occur in the next 12 months. A \"1 in a 100\" event is generally an insolvency risk and indeed a ruined art collection would be the equivalent to insolvency. The \"1 in a 100\" stress testing framework is used by the insurance industry, and the new initiative aims to integrate similar standards into the financial services sector and banking and securities regulation. In other words, to fortify financial assets in the same way as physical assets.Who knows if we can keep financial and physical assets safe in the face of the environmental dangers. But certainly we must act in the face of a bitter irony: that the climate change we have unleashed is so nefarious it is saddling timeless free pleasures, such as proximity to the sea, with costs and risks not conceived even a mere decade ago."}, {"title": "Ants Suddenly March In A Circle When An iPhone Rings", "text": "Bizarre video of bustling ants suddenly marching in a circle around an iPhone when it rings has the Internet wondering what the heck is going on.Here are some theories:\"The electromagnetic wave of an incoming call\" keeps them in a circle, according to ViralVideoLab's YouTube description.

The funders of this effort thought they'd get the jump on us in the last days of the legislative session, but HSUS lobbyist Jennifer Fearing has sniffed out their maneuvering, and newspaper editorial writers are crying foul at the plan to make mincemeat of the animal who adorns the logo of Australia's national airline, Qantas.California is the world's largest market for soccer cleats, many of which are made with kangaroo leather. But unless Australia and the soccer-gear sellers get their way, the import of kangaroo skin products into California will once again be banned and shoe manufacturers will have to opt for alternative products, which are abundant and already widely used in athletic footwear.A freshman lawmaker, California assemblyman Mike Gipson of Los Angeles, after being courted by the Aussies, has introduced a bill in a last-minute process known as a \"gut and amend\" -- as a way to sidestep regular order and a deliberative legislative process and to try to sneak in this repeal of a wildlife protection law in the waning days of the 2015 legislative session.This morning, the Sacramento Bee weighed in against this attempt to hoodwink California voters. Gipson, the editorial said, should \"not gut the [legislative] process like some hapless marsupial with a marketable hide.\"Contrary to the propaganda of the industry and the Australian government -- with the latter entity funneling $143,000 to lobbyists for this maneuver to keep the kangaroo parts market in California open -- the mass slaughter of kangaroos in Australia is neither sustainable nor humane. Commercial shooters kill millions of kangaroos each year in what is the largest land-based commercial slaughter of wildlife in the world. As a very slow-growing and slow-breeding species, kangaroos are at significant risk of local and regional decline if commercial hunting continues at its current pace. In the Australian states of Queensland and Western Australia in particular, population surveys conducted in 2014 show dramatic declines in kangaroo populations of around 50 percent across all areas surveyed.The Australian National Code of Practice advises that hunters shoot kangaroos through the brain to ensure immediate death, but because heads are removed before reaching the processor, there is no accurate confirmation. Low visibility at night often results in kangaroos being shot in their body or neck and left to die slowly and painfully or destroyed, since their pelt has been blemished by the body shot. The killing is almost entirely unmonitored. Last week, 70 scientists, academics, and public figures from Australia signed a letter identifying serious conservation, animal welfare, and human health concerns with the slaughter of kangaroos which, they said, is \"putting at high risk both kangaroo populations and people's health, and causes profound suffering to the kangaroos, particularly the dependent young.\"Baby kangaroos, known as joeys, fall victim to the inhumane hunting practices at an alarming rate. When any female kangaroo with a joey in her pouch or nearby is killed, the hunter is advised to bludgeon the joey to death or decapitate it. In 2014, hunters killed more than 130,000 females, resulting in the orphaning and killing of tens of thousands of joeys.In 1970, then California Governor Ronald Reagan banned the trade in kangaroo skin products. The California Supreme Court later unanimously upheld the law. But in 2007 the original California prohibition on the sale of kangaroo products became subject to a three-year exemption after intense lobbying by Adidas, the Australian government, and the kangaroo meat and skin industry. Additional efforts by the industry achieved a second extension on the exemption from the ban in 2010, this time with a five-year sunset clause which ends in 2015. Without legislation this year to extend the exemption or repeal the prohibition, come January 1, 2016, it will once again be illegal to trade in kangaroo products in California. This has led to the last-minute lobbying and now this bill from Gipson.If you live in California, please contact your state lawmakers and tell them to reject this sweetheart deal for a foreign industry and a foreign government. When you have foreign governments at work to influence U.S. policy, there is a special duty for transparency. But maybe even these officials know that once lawmakers and average citizens in the state get a look at the sordid details, they wouldn't much like what they see. That's probably why they are trying this stealth move so late in the game.This article first appeared on Wayne Pacelle's blog, A Humane Nation."}, {"title": "Five Things Sustainability Communicators Need to Give Up Now", "text": "Years ago there was a famous photograph of a young girl in Sudan crawling to a feeding station with a vulture (the ultimate bird of opportunity) behind her, as if waiting for her to surrender to the inevitable. The graphic and compelling image of human suffering was haunting and I recall it vividly today. Sustainability advocates, in an effort to tap into the same emotion, have used -- and used and used -- images of a polar bear (often a cub and what is presumably its mother) on a tiny piece of ice floating off into the great unknown. But the image does not compel others beyond those already convinced.Comedian George Carlin made this point several decades ago -- it is not about \"saving the planet\" and the Earth is not some fragile thing that needs us to nuture it. So it is time to give up the trite photographs of hands gently cradling seedlings (or the Earth) -- and the rhetoric about \"saving the planet.\" Nature is a powerful and resilient force we must respect and appreciate. It is resilient in that we can -- and sadly do -- pump tons of pollution into the atmosphere. We deluge our rivers and streams with pollution. Our oceans are virtually awash of plastic and waste. And yet, through it all, nature endures. It adapts. It overcomes. And ultimately we -- as individuals and as the human race -- can expect to be treated with the same level of special consideration as the Stegosaurus, the Dodo bird, the Passenger Pigeon, the gazelle being chased by the cheetah or the seal being snatched by the Orca -- that is to say ... none. It is only through our power of reason that we have the capacity to understand our role in creating (and changing) our own fate, just as we have extended the natural lifespan of our species (through hygiene, medicine, better diets, shelter, etc.) It is time we gave up the conceit that we need to save the planet and recognize that it will be fine with our without us. It is up to us to make sure we do not continue to blindly engage in actions that threaten our heath, well-being and safety.Another reason why we should abandon both of the above is that the neglect two thirds of the sustainability model -- the impact on people and the need for it to be linked to profitability. They continue to feed into the mistaken notion that sustainability is a synonym for environmental stewardship rather than a business model that seeks to increase profitability while being respectful of the environment and advancing of the human condition.It has been a compelling image for more than 100 years, as the ultimate symbol of hubris, over-reliance on technology, failure to heed multiple warnings leading to catastrophic doom. So the image of the RMS Titanic, fantail in the air prior to her final plunge into the abyss, has been overused to the point of tedium. Most recently it was used for climate change with a speech bubble from the stern: \"How can we be sinking when we're 200 feet in the air?\" It may get a few knowing chuckles from those who already understand and believe climate science, but does anyone really think that image is going to change anyone's mind? People may never get tired of using the image; but most people I know are tired of seeing it representing everything.Colin Durrant suggested via twitter that PDFs have passed their utility.

If that happens, it could become the longest-lived tropical cyclone this year. (The record for the longest belongs to 1994's Hurricane John, which then became a typhoon. It lasted 31 days and also crossed the dateline.)According to meteorologists, this has been a very active hurricane season because of El Niño, which occurs when the waters of the Pacific become exceptionally warm and distort weather patterns worldwide.On Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the current El Niño could be one of the strongest on record.

This week, President Obama held a conference in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss Arctic issues with the many countries involved in the region. This high-level meeting is a big step forward. We now need to match strong talk with action to fulfill our role as an Arctic nation.To help our country and our colleagues understand the opportunities and challenges we face, Congressman Don Young and I formed the Congressional Arctic Working Group last year. Since then, we have been pushing our colleagues and the administration to pay more attention to the growing needs of this region.The focus of the President's visit was primarily the need to address climate change -- a hugely important topic not just for the Arctic, but for the entire world. Climate change is one of the major challenges of our time, and the Arctic region is facing its impacts today. We need to take strong action to address it, and I support the President's Clean Power Plan as a critical component of reducing our country's greenhouse gas emissions.However, there are issues beyond climate change that deserve attention in the Arctic. The U.S. Coast Guard has said it needs at least three each of heavy and medium duty icebreakers. But currently the U.S. only has one of each. Without this capacity, our country will be unable to fulfill the environmental protection, research, search and rescue, and interdiction operations the Coast Guard must perform in the Arctic. While President Obama's announcement that he plans to invest in a new icebreaker was a positive step, the administration has never put serious funding for a new icebreaker in its budget. That needs to change. In his next budget, the President should provide the funding to match his icebreaker plans. We need icebreaking assets for many reasons, including to show our Arctic neighbors that the U.S. takes these issues seriously.Other countries are not waiting around for us to make the needed investments. Russia has 22 government-owned icebreakers and just started building another that will be the world's largest. China, which does not even have a direct link to the Arctic Ocean, is building its second icebreaker. Finland and Sweden have four icebreakers each. Even our bureaucracy falls short. While other countries have ambassadors who are specifically assigned to the Arctic Council, America does not. Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner and I have introduced a bill to change that.Even if we had better icebreaker capacity, we also need improved science and mapping to keep people and the environment in the Arctic safe. The recent breach of the MSV Fennica, a vessel Shell is using in its Arctic exploration, could likely have been avoided if the Arctic had the same charts that the rest of our country's maritime domain has. No one was hurt this time - but maritime traffic is going to continue traversing these difficult waters, and the next incident may be more serious. We need to invest in the mapping and science to allow safe human activity to occur in the Arctic.The people who live in the Arctic, including indigenous communities, also need more resources for economic development, clean energy, and access to communications that many of us in the rest of the U.S take for granted. Most Arctic communities run on diesel gas, which is expensive and only worsens the climate change challenges of the region. Basic communications systems also are difficult at high latitudes, leaving Arctic communities cut off from economic development opportunities. Developing clean energy technology and communications links for people living in the Arctic is an opportunity for the U.S. to cooperate with our neighbors in the region.The administration's Arctic conference spotlights the growing urgency our country faces if we are to act as good stewards of the unique waters and lands of our highest latitudes. But without sustained attention to the details of what the people and environment in the Arctic require, we will continue to fall short as an Arctic nation. We can do better, and I hope the President's visit to the high north marks the start of the higher level investment we need to make to be a stronger Arctic player."}, {"title": "Record-Setting Hurricanes Create Beautiful Mess Across The Pacific", "text": "Some strange things are happening in the Pacific Ocean.First, for a short period over the weekend, three -- yes, three -- powerful Category 4 hurricanes swirled simultaneously -- a meteorological first of its kind.Kilo, Ignacio and Jimena each had maximum sustained winds of more than 135 mph.Now, the trio has been joined by a fourth storm, tropical depression Fourteen-E, causing weather maps and satellite images of the storms to draw comparisons to Vincent van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" painting.As if that wasn't enough for the world's weather enthusiasts, one of the Pacific's storms -- Hurricane Kilo -- made the rare transformation from a hurricane to a typhoon when it crossed the international date line on Tuesday.Hurricane, typhoon and cyclone are regional names for the same tropical weather pattern, but storms don't often last long enough to travel between regions.Now-Typhoon Kilo has been swirling since Aug. 20 and is actually forecast to strengthen over the next several days. If that happens, it could become the longest-lived tropical cyclone this year. (The record for the longest belongs to 1994's Hurricane John, which then became a typhoon. It lasted 31 days and also crossed the dateline.)According to meteorologists, this has been a very active hurricane season because of El Niño, which occurs when the waters of the Pacific become exceptionally warm and distort weather patterns worldwide.On Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the current El Niño could be one of the strongest on record. Moreover, this year's event is still strengthening, with meteorologists expecting it to peak by the end of the year.While Hawaii has been in the middle of these storms, it has managed to avoid a direct hit so far.

But harnessing the same process that powers our sun is no small task. Superhot plasma must be created and contained so that two hydrogen atoms can combine to form helium and give off a huge amount of energy at the same time.The key to a successful fusion reactor design is magnets, because magnetic fields must be used to trap the heat and atomic particles in the device's reactor core. That's why attention is turning to MIT, where researchers supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation are proposing a new multi-billion-dollar design for a practical compact fusion reactor that includes some impressive new magnet technology.The idea is to use new commercially available superconductors, rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting tapes, to produce high-magnetic field coils. The tapes are much smaller than copper conductors of the past, making it possible to design a smaller and less expensive reactor. When cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature, the superconducting tape can carry as much current as the larger copper conductor.A cutaway view of the proposed ARC (affordable, robust, compact) reactor. New magnet technology makes the reactor smaller and less expensive than previous designs while delivering the same power. (Source: MIT ARC team)As it turns out, achievable fusion power increases according to the fourth power of the increase in the magnetic field; so doubling the effectiveness of the magnetic field would produce a 16-fold increase in fusion power. The superconductors aren't there yet, but they are strong enough to increase fusion power by about a factor of 10 compared to today's superconducting technology.Additionally, the new superconducting magnets would enable the reactor to operate in a sustained way, producing a steady power output, unlike today's reactors, which can only operate for a few seconds at a time without overheating their copper coils.The goal for any fusion reactor is to create more electricity than it consumes, otherwise what's the point? The MIT reactor should ultimately be able to produce five to six times the energy it consumes, MIT's scientists say, about 190 megawatts. If true, that would be a stunning breakthrough even if, according to some estimates, the cost of capturing that power would be more than ten times the price of, say, the equivalent amount of wind power for the foreseeable future. One compact reactor could provide enough electricity for about 100,000 people, bringing the true power of the sun into the home for the first time.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed.Don Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites."}, {"title": "Even These Big Fossil Fuel Companies Support An International Climate Agreement", "text": "A large number of the world's biggest energy companies endorse a global climate agreement that would commit to limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, according to a survey released Wednesday.Thirteen of the 28 largest energy companies in the world said their board of directors would support an international agreement.

The obvious winners of a lower oil price are oil importers and energy intensive sectors but a speculation that cheaper fossil fuels would mean a serious setback for renewables has been rife. Considering the latest data, however, it seems renewables are still going strong and it is the fossil fuel industry that is running into both short and long-term difficulties. For the first time in history, the five top sources of newly installed electricity in Europe were renewables, with hydropower, biomass and thermosolar (CSP) following wind and PV with the Global solar PV demand is forecast to grow by up to 25% in 2015.At the end of 2009, the world's cumulative installed PV capacity was more than 23 GW. One year later it was 40.3 GW and at the end of 2011 it was 70.5 GW. In 2012, the 100 GW mark was reached and by 2013, almost 138.9 GW of PV had been installed globally --an amount capable of producing at least 160 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity every year. This energy volume is sufficient to cover the annual power supply needs of over 45 million European households. This is also the equivalent of the electricity produced by 32 large coal power plants.Levelized Cost of EnergyThe weighted average LCOE of utility-scale solar PV in China and North America - the world's two largest power-consuming markets -- and in South America, has also now fallen into the range of fossil fuel-fired electricity costs. For utility-scale solar PV projects installed in 2013 and 2014, the weighted average LCOE by region ranged from a low of around USD 0.11 to USD 0.12/kWh (in South and North America, respectively) to over USD 0.31/kWh (in Central America and the Caribbean). But for individual projects, the range of costs is much wider. In various countries with good solar resources, projects are now being built with an LCOE of USD 0.08/kWh, while a recent tender in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, resulted in a successful bid for a solar PV power purchase agreement (PPA) for just USD 0.06/kWh, without financial support. Where good resources exist and low-cost financing is available, utility-scale solar PV projects that are now being built (e.g., in Dubai, Chile and other parts of the world) will provide electricity at a lower cost than fossil fuels, without any financial support. PV's growing competitiveness holds just as true in regions where indigenous fossil fuels are abundant.Falling costs make renewables increasingly competitive and the best onshore wind projects now match or even undercut electricity generated from fossil fuels (even without subsidy) and cost of utility scale solar power has halved since 2010. While renewables are on the up, fossil fuels have increasingly come under pressure. In the short term, the oil price slide has forced companies to slash their exploration and production spending, shedding staff and cancelling projects as they become unprofitable. The long term may look bleak, too.Investment Appetite  Overall, investment in clean energy worldwide jumped by 16% in 2014 to $310 billion, just 2% shy of the all-time high in 2011, as Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports. Investments in Renewable Energy include private technology development, equipment manufacturing, project finance and M&A activity. Clean energy is the largest sector which from 2007 to 2012 reached $2.6 trillion in investments and commitments. Against the backdrop of a slowing world economy, this is certainly impressive.Only in the solar sector, the total global corporate funding, including venture capital/private equity (VC), debt financing, and public market financing raised by public companies, almost doubled with $6.4 billion in Q1 2015, compared to $3.4 billion in Q4 2014. A total of 33 VCs invested in Q1 2015. Solar downstream companies continued to attract most of the VC funding with $112 million in 12 deals. Public market financing came to $1.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in Q4 2014. Debt financing increased substantially this quarter with almost $5 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in Q4 2014. This was a record quarter for residential and commercial solar funds with $1.9 billion raised in 10 deals, the highest amount in a quarter. Of this total, $200 million went to a loan fund while the rest went to third-party lease or PPA funds.The economic case for renewables remains strong, as does the environmental. Oil price turmoil shouldn't be allowed to overshadow the bigger issue at stake that 2014 was globally the hottest year on record.Oil Prices & OPEC  OPEC members have been increasingly worried about the low prices for oil and they will protect their own interest since OPEC realizes that $39.50 was the peak of 1980 and 1990--also the top of the previous secular cycle in crude oil. Several OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers rely heavily on oil revenues to finance their fiscal budgets. Over the near-term, for oil exporting governments, falling revenue will not be fully offset by reduced expenditures. This will cause major oil exporters to run either smaller budget surpluses or bigger budget deficits. Some producers have already started adjusting their upcoming budgets to reflect the crude oil price decline. If crude oil prices continue to fall or are sustained at a lower level, then oil-dependent producers will have to make tough policy decisions. This could potentially lead to austerity programs and fuel subsidy cuts that could spark social unrest, leaving some countries vulnerable to supply disruptions if protestors target oil infrastructure. Potential new supply disruptions are a real possibility in a lower-than-expected price climate and present an uncertainty in the world oil supply forecast.With WTI crude settled below $39 on Aug. 24, for the first time since Feb. 2009 price levels are not sustainable for oil producers, and any price below $39.50 is of secondary importance. If you don't believe Saudi Arabia will cut production any time soon, not even at $20, then they are waiting for U.S. production to decline much further, and that might not happen until next spring. If U.S. production will eventually decline the damage to Saudi Arabia from [the low oil prices] will be at least as damaging as it seems to U.S. producers. ConocoPhillips announced that it will reduce its global workforce by about 10%, blaming the impact of lower oil pricesOil prices will move higher if Saudi Arabia makes a sacrifice and cuts its own production--and that would benefit every other producing nation but obviously, market share continues to be Saudi Arabia's main concern--and not even $40 oil prices will make it give into peer pressure to cut production. Instead output from the Saudi Arabia climbed to about 10.45 million barrels a day in July from 10.1 million in April, according to an estimate from Platts, even though West Texas Intermediate and Brent oil prices are down roughly 15% year to date on the back of a global supply glut.However, the decline in energy prices is also likely to ease the global fiscal stance. In the aggregate, the swing from oil producers to consumers is quite large. A $20 per barrel decline in global oil prices results in an income transfer of about $670 billion per year from producers to consumers or alternatively according to the IMF, a USD 10 per barrel fall in prices translates into 0.5% additional growth. The sharp decline in energy prices will bring positive development for both the U.S. and the global economy since the U.S. still is a net importer of energy, it will be supportive to the global growth outlook by pulling down inflation in many countries. While that may not immediately help generate economic growth, it will in the future, by reducing the required deleveragingClosing the above analysis it is worthwhile to mention that the worldwide population has stayed fairly consistent throughout time. This is because our only source of energy was the sun. Before we tapped into fossil fuels the sun's energy alone could never sustain a population of more than 500 million to 750 million people. During the Industrial revolution, the number of people on Earth roughly doubled, reaching 1 billion around 1950. The real spike started when we struck black gold. World population growth and income will continue to rise, increasing the demand on primary energy supplies. Meeting this demand will be driven by fuel availability, technology efficiency and environmental sustainability. But in today's world, a smart, informed local public will increasingly have the final say in what is both politically affordable and sustainable."}, {"title": "Bristol Palin Is Not Happy About Obama Restoring Denali's Name", "text": "Bristol Palin criticized President Barack Obama's decision to restore Mt.

No, on the contrary I believe we have become inured to the problem. Stop. Think. Do I need this straw, this bag, this little red stir stick, this little plastic green grass with my sushi, or that bottle of water? Baristas, bartenders, and food servers automatically provide a straw or a stir stick without asking, without thinking; and You, the consumers, immediately accept it and toss it away. So, the answer is NO! You don't need it. And YES! We need to keep talking about the problem of plastic consumption and waste until it no longer exists.Jeff Bridges resolves to refuse plastic bottles; Amy Smart speaks out for us to end our plastic addiction; and Marisa Miller is a spokesperson for Surfrider Foundation. Jason Mraz sings out for us to care for our beautiful planet; and Ted Danson authored Oceana, a very detailed account of how we have hurt our oceans and how we can heal them; Woody Harrelson is a passionate environmentalist; Jack Johnson, the environmentally conscious surfer dude singer, sailed on the 5 Gyres expeditions and founded the social action network All At Once; and David de Rothschild constructed a boat called Plastiki from 12,500 recycled plastic bottles to sail the Pacific from San Francisco to Sydney. Each of these A-listers is an advocate raising awareness and funds to better our planet, and reduce the heaping pile of end-of-the-line plastic consumption and production. They are trendsetters-let's follow their examples of conservation versus consumption and refuse what you can't reuse!I don't understand why every day, even the ardent conservationist continues to cling to old habits, even with celebrities speaking out, movies made educating and raising awareness about our polluted waters and forests, and campaigns around the globe providing solutions and encouraging us to change our habits. It is common knowledge that our earth suffers from plastic pollution. On the web and in the news we see images of vast islands of floating plastic, dead waterfowl and whales with decayed guts filled with our plastic throwaways, and riverbeds lined with plastic bottles and wrappers. Yet too few of us have stopped using single-use, end-of-the-line plastic.My awareness and advocacy for eliminating plastic pollution began on a trip to Bali. I had lived in Indonesia in the 1980s, and a few years ago I returned for a visit. Today, Bali is an international destination for jet-setting, globe-trotting, and soul-seeking travelers. I knew there would be many changes: Luxury spa hotels along the beach where before the waves rolled up the shore and touched the rice fields. Loud, thumping \"boom-boom\" from the pulsating music of the crowded nightclubs where before I sat on the beach, looking at the stars, listening to the crashing waves and croaking frogs. And fashionable high-priced boutiques where there used to be makeshift food stalls serving scrumptious nasi goreng in banana leaves. But, what I did not expect to see were beaches lined with trash--plastic trash.The overwhelming amount of pollution that had washed onto the beaches, floating in the ocean, and lining the riverbanks was astonishing. For my fellow travelers who hadn't seen Bali before it was shocking and disgusting. For me, who had experienced the pristine Bali, it was devastating. I was deeply saddened by this degradation to the landscape. Most of this pollution is from single use plastic, a result of the onslaught of global consumption and production of economical and portable packaging. Seeing those heaps of plastic, I was determined at that moment to do what I could to reverse this destructive process.I am an advocate for refusing single-use plastic. I changed my habits. I speak out. Okay, maybe my strident frankness may annoy some people. Yet, just as in parenting, you can make a strong impact with a repeated message and through example with your actions. Children witness everything and from this they learn. When they leave home your voice and example echo in their subconscious. All of the well-intentioned advice you provided to them, even if they rebelled at the moment, will inspire within them action and conscious choices for better living. I hope for the same with my relentless personal campaign to put a stop to single-use plastic.This problem needs attention, in your community and across the globe. In my travels, I witness how big-brand beverage companies-namely Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Nestle-misdirect consumers into believing that the healthy drink is bottled water. These companies have realized their losing battle in the sugary soda market in response to the increasingly health-conscious society, and consequently have turned their marketing towards bottling water. Their aim is for profit, not for health. And, they have convinced people that drinking from a bottle is the only choice, even in places where tap water is perfectly safe to drink, and healthier. I have safely drunk tap water in Turkey, Mexico, Greece, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Brazil, just to name a few.In many places where the tap water is perfectly safe, for example in the USA, not only travelers but also locals have been deluded into believing that tap water is unsafe by the beverage companies who profit from the drinking of bottled water. Some have even gotten the message that tap water is uncouth. Why is that? It is baffling that in restaurants, servers immediately inquire if you prefer a bottle of still or sparkling water, inflicting snobbery if you ask for tap, and the duped diner pretentiously orders a bottle.For the first time in years, I traveled to a country where indeed the tap water is unsafe-Peru. Even so, boiling water or using a water filtration device used for backpacking can easily treat the water for safe, BPA-free consumption.There are admirable heroes fighting for positive change in this arena: Anna Cummins and Marcus Eriksen, who cofounded 5 Gyres; Beth Terry, who took her personal challenge as an example to inspire others with My Plastic Free Life; Douglas Woodring of The Ocean Recovery Alliance; Andrew Sharpless, who heads the international advocacy organization Oceana.org; David Saiia, cofounder of Reuse Everything Institute, who strategizes community-building solutions by reusing plastic pollution; Boyan Slat, who discovered a new technology to clean up plastic pollution in our oceans, and the list continues with so many I esteem.Often, when an individual sees only the Big problem rather than the Big solution, they feel defeated before beginning. The problem seems insurmountable, a Sisyphean effort. They may think, \"What can I do to make an impact? Why should I even try?\" In this issue of plastic waste, I truly only see the Big solution of which I want to be a part. I believe that even if my efforts are small in comparison, even if they are only a grain of sand on the Sahara, they will contribute to a greater outcome--a better life for all living organisms on planet Earth. I believe each one of us is empowered to be apart of this change. If each of us begins now-by refusing to consume single-use plastic--then one by one, we will make a Big difference. Soon, each grain of sand added together will become a beach refuge, in a beautiful peaceful cove, looking out onto the clean, plastic-free, great blue ocean.As I was preparing this discourse, I wondered, what could I possibly write that hasn't already been said? Well, this is it--like a mental chain letter passed along, I humbly add my name to the list of those advocating for ending the use of single-use plastic. I encourage you to add your name to the list and pass it on.The important thing is to do something, anything, even a small gesture. Refuse to use straws, carry your own reusable water or hot beverage bottle, tote your own reusable bag, pack a 'take home' container when you know you will be carrying home food from the grocery store deli or local restaurant, bring along reusable eating utensils when traveling--just begin. Even the smallest gesture collectively makes an impact. What I do know is that not doing anything changes nothing. I proudly do my small part to make change happen and I hope you will, too.You may read more of Katherine's writings on plastic and other issues at www.ahhtobehumble.com"}, {"title": "Words Matter in the Paris Climate Agreement", "text": "Words matter. This is especially true for the Paris Agreement on climate change to be concluded this December. Businesses and investors have a clear stake in the words in the agreement and in the political commitment behind them, which will underpin the policy certainty they need to build the low-carbon economy. Getting the right words in the right place is essential to success.Businesses and governments alike recognize that the low-carbon economy is inevitable, irreversible and irresistible. Businesses and investors are already stepping up to the plate. Through the We Mean Business coalition, 154 companies with revenues totaling $3.5 trillion, and 111 investors with $8.1 trillion in assets under management, have now made 430 ambitious commitments to climate action.At the same time, 56 countries covering nearly 60% of global emissions, including the three largest emitters -- China, the U.S., and the EU -- have now announced their commitments to reduce emissions and build climate resilience under the new, universal Paris Agreement. By the time Paris arrives, we expect that all of the major economies will have commitments on the table.These are important commitments which will reduce projected warming, drive the expansion of clean industries, create low-carbon jobs, improve energy access and energy security, help us adapt to a changing climate, and protect our health. But we know that these commitments alone will not be enough to keep warming below 2°C.A successful Paris Agreement will clearly show how governments, business, and civil society will finish the job in the years ahead. The agreement we want to see will set a collective long-term emissions goal. For We Mean Business, this means net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century, words that give us a likely chance of holding warming below 2°C.Every country can begin to decarbonize and so can every business, no matter its sector or maturity. By mapping out their unique pathways towards net zero, each country will provide the incentives for business to do the same.A successful Paris Agreement will also spell out the means to reach this goal beyond the first round of country commitments in Paris. These include regularly strengthening country commitments, holding governments accountable, and shifting trillions of dollars towards low-carbon investment.• Regularly strengthening commitments. At meetings in July, Ministers converged on returning to the negotiating table every five years, but it remains unclear what they will do when they get there. Here it is---the verb that matters. No business was ever founded on a review or stock take. When leading businesses meet their targets, they immediately set more ambitious ones. Governments should put their timidity aside and agree to strengthen their commitments every five years.• Holding governments accountable. Transparency and accountability are the foundations of a credible agreement. Thousands of businesses publically report their emissions and are increasingly having their emissions accounting externally verified. Here what we need are rules requiring governments to make clear how they are tracking against their targets, and how well their collective effort is tracking against a 2°C trajectory. This will provide a level playing field for global business.• Shifting the trillions. The Copenhagen pledge to mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020 is key to the trust necessary for a strong Paris Agreement. Businesses and investors are ready to do their part to leverage private climate finance. But minimizing dangerous climate impacts will require shifting trillions of dollars into low-carbon, climate-resilient investment. To accomplish this, we will look to the Paris outcome for clear policy signals such as carbon pricing, and partnerships with the private sector to reorient broader financial flows.With a clear goal and clear means to reach that goal in the Paris Agreement, a 2°C world will be within reach. In its recent report Seizing the Global Opportunity, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate shows that stronger cooperation between governments, business, and civil society can put us on track.Words matter in the Paris Agreement. The right words will speed the construction of the low-carbon economy and promote sustainable prosperity for all. In these endeavours the governments coming to Paris have steadfast partners, and we mean business.Authors (listed in alphabetical order by organization)Peter Boyd, Senior Climate Advisor, The B-Team Edward Cameron, Managing Director, Partnership Development and Research, BSR David Wei, Associate Director, Climate Change, BSR Kate Levick, Director of Policy and Regulation, CDP Anne Kelly, Senior Director, Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy, Ceres Damian Ryan, Head of International Policy, The Climate Group Eliot Whittington, Deputy Director, The Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group Carina Larsfalten, Managing Director, Global Policy Affairs, WBCSD"}, {"title": "See Plans For The 62-Mile Wall That Would Capture Trash In The Pacific", "text": "Nature isn't doomed if we work fast enough.That's the essential premise fueling The Ocean Cleanup, an organization that hopes to pull an unbelievable amount of plastic waste from the Pacific Ocean in the next decade.\"The story has always been: We can't clean it up, so the best thing we can do is not make it worse,\" Boyan Slat, Ocean Cleanup founder, told The Huffington Post in a Skype interview. \"To me, that's depressing.\"That is depressing. Imagine Earth as a stewing mound of sun-baked waste that everyone's standing on, nostrils clenched shut by fingers. Some may do their part to avoid making the mound bigger, but how many are able to make it  smaller?Slat thinks his team can.The Ocean Cleanup, which is funded in large part by entrepreneurs like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, recently collected data on the plastic trash in the North Pacific Ocean as part of its \"Mega Expedition.\" Crews on nearly 30 ships used a smartphone app and other tools to keep track of the plastic they observed in the water. Slat needs the data to help enact an ambitious plan: the deployment of a massive aquatic barrier that will corral trash into a concentrated area for collection.\"This is the first time anyone's ever quantified the large debris -- things like crates, bottles, buoys and nets,\" Slat told HuffPost.\"The amount of large stuff really was a surprise. It was a lot more big stuff than small stuff by a factor of 100 or 1,000. Some is still to be analyzed, but it's clear there's a lot more plastic out there than expected,\" he continued.(Story continues below slideshow.)Here's the good news: While the amount of plastic waste was shocking, the problem can be remedied. In 2020, The Ocean Cleanup plans to place a 62-mile trash-capturing structure in the water between Hawaii and California. You could think of it like a series of walls connected to the seabed roughly three miles beneath the surface.It will be in a \"V\" shape and look something like the rendering below -- a mock-up set near Tsushima Island, Japan, where the Ocean Cleanup hopes to place a test unit next year:While it's obviously not so easy to develop and deploy in practice, the technology is simple in theory: The wall takes advantage of the natural movement of ocean currents, therefore allowing the trash to pile up on its own.\"Instead of going after the plastic using nets and vessels, which would take an infinite amount of time, we developed this system,\" Slat told HuffPost. \"The plastic moves toward the center, and therefore the concentration increases 100,000 times. You really can walk on the water.\"Once the garbage is concentrated, vessels can pick it up and take it for recycling. The Ocean Cleanup group believes that after 10 years, the structure will have removed a substantial portion of the waste in the North Pacific.Of course, great as this idea is, the rest of the planet is responsible for coming up with sustainable solutions to avoid refilling the water with plastic, which ends up being consumed by animals.\"The concentration of plastic in the ocean is increasing. The influx is increasing exponentially. Governments and organizations need to step up their game,\" Slat told HuffPost.On a macro level, more regulations could be implemented to cut down on the plastic waste that comes from even simple things like packaging and grocery bags. Companies can use more biodegradable materials in their products.Individuals can push for all of this to happen while making small changes in their own lives. Take a reusable tote to the grocery store instead of using plastic bags. Recycle. Use a refillable water bottle.Meanwhile, The Ocean Cleanup continues to move forward.\"It's sort of a ticking time bomb,\" Slat told HuffPost of marine debris. \"The stuff doesn't go away by itself. It needs to be cleaned up and it needs to happen soon.\"If it doesn't happen soon, the larger plastics might break down into micro-plastics, which are much harder to manage. Slat hopes his group's work will inspire.\"We hope to make millions of people aware of the problem itself, as well as making the problem visible,\" Slat said. \"By showing there is a way, we can make it better.\""}, {"title": "Danes Waste 104 Pounds Of Food Per Year. For Americans, It's 273.", "text": "NPR: Denmark Might Be Winning The Global Race To Prevent Food WasteCould the Danes hold the key to addressing global food waste?The Scandinavian country has emerged as an international leader on the issue thanks to some unique approaches outlined by NPR’s Sidsel Overgaard.Food waste in the country is down 25 percent over the past five years -- the highest waste reduction in the European Union, the Copenhagen Post reported earlier this year. According to NPR, the average Dane throws out 104 pounds of food annually, compared with a whopping annual estimate of 273 pounds for each American.Stop Wasting Food, an advocacy organization backed by Selina Juul, has been credited with the decrease. So have grocery chains like Dansk Supermarked, which sells food nearing its expiration date at a reduced price in a specially-marked, dedicated area rather than discarding it. Dansk is also utilizing a new IT system to keep better track of what types of inventory most frequently go to waste, NPR reports. When that system identified bread as the top culprit, the chain started to order less and dedicated more space to sell bread nearing expiration at a reduced price. These efforts reduced their bread waste by 60 percent.Still, there is more progress to be made. Danish food waste still totals more than 700,000 tons annually, costing Danish consumers more than $1.6 billion dollars a year, according to the organization United Against Food Waste.Internationally, one-third of the food produced for consumption is wasted -- a troubling figure given that some 795 million people globally are undernourished.MORE:Springwise: Free resources helps transgender people find indiscriminate doctorsPRI: Here's a doll house for little engineersThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

Our services are structured around the understanding that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one attention and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success._____Death By Drought  By Ben Friedman-Hibbs, Age 11Sure, we've all heard about the drought. It is causing a dry spell with very little rain, and it is drying out the landscape. But there is one terrifying fact that most people don't know: the drought is literally MOVING us! According to NASA, \"So much groundwater has disappeared -- much of it from pumping to farms -- that it's causing the state to shrink in mass.\"Now, you may be thinking, \"Why should I care if there is a drought?\" There are a few simple answers. First, the obvious one: we, animals, and plants all need water. Then there are some that we take for granted. We could lose precious things we use daily, such as taking showers and washing dishes. The final point: we could lose our crops and not have enough food.According to \"California's Record Drought Is Making Earth's Surface Rise\", \"The record-breaking California drought is so bad that monitoring stations used to study earthquakes can detect the drying ground rising up. Measurements of these subtle movements, made using GPS instruments, suggest that the western United States is missing some 62 trillion gallons of water, enough to cover the entire region six inches deep.\" So there you have it: we are rising AND shrinking.Another thought that may be going through your mind is, \"How can I tell the difference between hot weather and a drought?\" According to Juliet Christian-Smith, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, \"The difference between hot/dry weather and a drought is that 'drought' means a dry period bad enough to have social, environmental, or economic effects. In other words, droughts occur when people or the environment suffers from water shortages.\" Are there different classifications of droughts? Christian-Smith says, \"Yes, the U.S. Drought Monitor has four different drought classifications. Most of California is currently in an exceptional drought, which means that there are \"exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses; shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells creating water emergencies.\" California is in the highest level of drought, called a D4.How do droughts affect us? Christian-Smith says, \"Droughts often mean that people who live in cities and towns have to conserve water by not watering lawns or washing cars, taking shorter showers, and turning off the tap while we brush our teeth. Droughts also mean that farmers have less water to grow food.\"What does it mean that the drought is shrinking California? Christian-Smith says, \"If you think about the ground as a sponge, when we have a lot of water it sinks into the ground and fills up the sponge. When we pump water out of the ground and we don't have a lot of rain, the sponge can dry up. When the 'sponge' of the soil dries up it shrinks a little, we can detect this shrinkage when we see that the land is dropping in certain places where it is very dry and we are pumping a lot of water out of the ground.\"Now I pose one final question: How can we stop this drought? Christian-Smith says \"Use water wisely: when we use less water, there is more water to go around. Most of the water that we use in California is used outdoors, to grow crops and to water lawns; therefore it is particularly important to find ways to minimize outdoor water use. For instance, some people have 'drought-tolerant lawns' that have plants that use less water instead of grass.''So now that you've heard this, will you take a long shower tonight? Will YOU use the extra water?_____The writing on this blog comes out of the Valencia Bay-farer journalism workshop, a free workshop for elementary and middle school students that produces 826 Valencia's one and only in-house newspaper.

Which is fantastic news. Who doesn't want to give fish species verging on extinction a break? But while MPAs provide ecosystems a chance for regeneration, there's no stopping other bad things from drifting into these aquatic preserves. The worst baddie floating through is carbonic acid, and why only an immediate reduction in carbon emissions will protect the ocean for real.  The ocean absorbs a third of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide released via our burning of fossil fuels and break neck deforestation. But that favor comes at a steep price...an acidifying ocean.Ocean acidification means even marine habitats under the strictest MPA designation \"no-take zones\" are struggling to cope with water that's 30 percent more acidic than pre-industrial revolution.In 1850 the ocean was around 8.2 pH, at our current rate of CO2 emissions it could drop to 7.8 pH by the end of this century. This overall change may sound like small potatoes, but equates to 100-150 percent more acidity.For comparison, one of the leading U.S ocean acidification experts, Dr. Richard Feely, senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says if our blood -- which is pH neutral -- became .3 more acidic, our bodies would cease to function.The implications for the ocean are just as dire.The more acidic the ocean the less carbonate ions -- what shellfish and coral use to build their calcium carbonate shells and skeletons.Warm water corals are already being decimated by a combination of ocean acidification and coral bleaching -- caused by warming ocean temperatures. Some estimates say these reefs will be gone by 2050.Tropical coral species are particularly hard pressed -- adapted to live in the world's warmest waters -- they can only endure the slightest changes in temperature.Most MPAs are in regions rich with coral reefs -- because though reefs constitute only one percent of ocean habitat they're home to a quarter of all marine species.Fortunately, under the protection of MPA's over-exploited reefs can recover and regain resilience, but they're not foolproof. Some anthropogenic threats are reduced by MPAs, but the pervasive nature of ocean acidification means there's no best-case scenario: some species can run, but none can hide, and coral reefs are the proverbial sitting duck.Paul Rose, of National Geographic Pristine Seas, sums it up, \"It's like we're conducting a massive experiment,\" in the huge watery petri dish of the ocean. Throwing everything we can at it -- toxic urban and agricultural run-off, tons of greenhouse gases, oil spills, seismic air-gun blasting, destructive fishing practices -- hoping for the best.And so far our ocean conservation efforts are not cutting it -- MPAs only cover about 2-3 percent of the ocean. There are efforts being made to transplant corals to regions with water temperatures in their adaptive range. But bottom line according to Dr. Feely is that, \"the impact of anthropogenic CO2 far outweighs any adaptive strategy that has been thought about so far.\"Ocean acidity is also a highly localized problem. Because though the ocean operates as a single fluid entity connected by massive currents, the carbonic acid isn't evenly distributed. A combination of upwelling water that's high in CO2 already occurs on continental west coasts. At the surface it mixes with water that's absorbed atmospheric CO2, the combined acidic corrosivity of this water is further exacerbated by nutrient rich runoff from densely populated coastal regions.This west coast phenomenon struck in 2007 with a sudden and severe mortality event in oyster larvae hatcheries in Oregon. The larvae couldn't make their shells because local seawater was too acidic. Some U.S fish hatcheries are adapting by relocating their commercial operations.Now the U.S salmon industry -- worth $37 billion annually -- is in trouble. Salmon are dying because Columbia River water is too warm. And their food source, pteropods (planktonic snails) are being dissolved by acidic seawater.The U.S government is calling on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to up its game on ocean acidification research, and meaningfully tackle the issue at the climate change talks in Paris this December (COP21). And scientists are casting off their professional position as unbiased observers because climate change's deleterious effects on the ocean are happening too fast and too acutely.Last year President Obama created the world's largest MPA, by expanding the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument to nearly half a million square miles of pristine south-central Pacific Ocean.MPA's covering such rich, relatively unspoiled, ocean biodiversity are vitally important. But a static perimeter drawn on a map does NOT equate to a stalwart defense in an ocean that is becoming a gigantic toxic cocktail.If President Obama gets rid of the Keystone XL pipeline once and for all, kicks Shell Oil out of the Arctic, stops seismic air gun oil exploration on the Atlantic seaboard, and puts a moratorium on fracking -- the masquerade that continuing to burn fossil fuels is okay will end. And he would truly be safeguarding the ocean -- a favor it urgently needs."}, {"title": "The 'New Normal' In Washington State", "text": "\"I could show you what it looked like before the fire.\" Shane Horton pulls out his tablet in the smoke-filled parking lot of Hank's supermarket, where two Humvees full of tired-looking National Guardsmen are keeping watch for looters.

It will then head to the governor's desk.\"We are seeing a poaching crisis that has the potential to impact an entire species of elephants and rhinos,\" Toni Atkins, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. \"We are one step closer to taking decisive action to prevent the harmful and illegal act of poaching to protect conservation efforts and help protect these delicate creatures.\"A legal trade of elephant parts imported before 1977 had been allowed in California. But many merchants flouted those rules, artificially aging the appearance of new items and selling them anyways.The practice is particularly common in California, where San Francisco and Los Angeles trail only New York City in ivory imports, a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council found last year. The U.S. is the second biggest ivory market after China.The trade in ivory and rhino horn has skyrocketed in recent years due to increased demand from a rising middle and upper class in some Asian countries, particularly China. The price of raw ivory tripled between 2010 and 2014, and now fetches up to $2,100 a kilogram, according to Save the Elephants. Rhino horn often sells for up to $65,000 a kilo, more than its weight in gold.The move has been lauded by animal conservation groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, who backed the legislation and praised the \"landmark bills.\"\"This is the year of the elephant in California,\" Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the group, said in a statement. \"If Governor Brown signs them, California will be the first state on the Pacific coast to crack down so meaningfully on the trade in ivory.\"The governor's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.The Santa Cruz Sentinel notes the measure has drawn sharp criticism from hunting groups, including the NRA, which has not responded to a Huffington Post request for comment. Other ivory traders told the outlet the bill would be \"unfair,\" and the state should compensate them for any merchandise that could become illegal.Godfrey \"Jeff\" Harris, an ivory collector and the managing director of the Ivory Education Institute in Los Angeles, also objected to the bill, warning that it will create a high-price black market for ivory goods.\"Californians should be allowed to keep and benefit from those historic, artistic, practical, decorative and scientific ivory items they bought legally and in good faith years ago,\" Harris wrote in an email to HuffPost. \"Making potential criminals of law-abiding Californians who have done nothing wrong and have committed no act against the health, welfare, or safety of their fellow citizens is the insane idea of the Humane Society of the United States. California should not be party to fostering the formation of a black market and repeating the errors of its governmental predecessors who voted for Prohibition only to see alcohol consumption in the United States rise.\"But WildAid director Peter Knights said in a statement the passage \"brings California one step closer to closing loopholes that for decades have allowed illegal ivory sales to continue.\" His group estimates at least 33,000 elephants are killed every year for their tusks."}, {"title": "At Hearings Across West, Public Demands Federal Coal Leasing Reform", "text": "In the Powder River Basin (PRB), everything seems larger than life. The impossibly blue skies stretch on forever over rolling grasslands speckled with buttes. At the height of summer, herds of pronghorn antelope mix with ranch cattle seeking shaded gullies in the almost-endless sagebrush.Come around a bend in the road, and you'll suddenly come upon another oversized part of the landscape: the largest coal strip mines in the United States, where giant shovels (some over 10 stories tall) scrape away soil to reach their dirty product. The PRB, stretching from northeast Wyoming into southern Montana, generates 40 percent of our nation's coal, more than any other region. Much of this coal comes from taxpayer-owned public lands. So why are coal companies being given a sweetheart deal to extract it? That was the focus of public listening sessions across the West that just wrapped up, as the Obama Administration considers making changes to the federal coal leasing program.The Bureau of Land Management, part of the US Department of the Interior, oversees America's taxpayer-owned lands in the PRB and manages them \"for a variety of uses\" including recreation, ranching and energy development. To make management decisions, the BLM ranks these activities. For decades, the agency has considered mining to be one of the high-priority uses for federal public lands. Approximately 90 percent of all federal coal mined comes from the Powder River Basin, where the BLM has turned over more than 160,000 acres of prime ranching, hunting, habitat and recreation land to Big Coal.In return for being allowed to disrupt, degrade and even destroy public lands, coal companies are supposed to pay royalties to both federal and state governments that help fund schools, roads and other public programs. But the current royalty rate for strip-mined coal has been in place for almost 40 years and is grossly outdated and undervalued, leaving plenty of opportunities for Big Coal to find loopholes in the guidelines. As a result, over the past 30 years, taxpayers have been shortchanged to the tune of around $30 billion in lost coal royalty revenues. What's more, the BLM's priorities are profoundly out-of-step with President Obama's climate action plan, giving coal companies financial incentives to mine and burn millions of tons coal from Western states that already are feeling the heat from climate disruption.Acknowledging this dissonance at a speech earlier this year, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said it was time to hold an \"honest and open conversation\" about reforming the federal coal program. Well, now that conversation has begun.In August, the Sierra Club and its partners united for a series of hearings on the federal coal program by the BLM's parent agency, the Department of the Interior. Four of the five sessions took place in the heart of coal country, so it's no surprise that Big Coal brought senior executives out in number. But Interior probably did not expect to hear from so many passionate community members who asked BLM to reform the federal coal leasing program. These individuals, who included ranchers, members of tribal nations, local elected officials and faith leaders, asked Interior and the BLM to stop subsidizing the profits of coal companies on the backs of taxpayers, hold those companies accountable for cleaning up mines when the work is done and stop prioritizing carbon-polluting coal at the expense of our climate and other land uses.Here are some of the highlights:In Billings, Montana, people who testified in support of coal leasing reform outnumbered coal company supports by a ratio of 3:1:'It's time that you crack down on coal companies that have been getting sweetheart deals for too long,' said Renette Kaline, of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe. 'You must take a look at what you're doing and the ripple effect it has on our lives, our land.'In Gillette, Wyoming, long a stronghold of coal companies, a small group of activists asked Interior to support an economically diverse future for Wyoming and facilitated live video testimony from state finance experts who could not attend in personIn Denver, more than half of people testifying supported coal reform, including local businesspeople who spoke about the impacts of climate change on other state industries like skiing and winter tourism:Keith Baker, a town trustee in Buena Vista, said he thinks climate change brought about by carbon emissions has hurt his southern Colorado town. The town, dependent on outdoor-focused tourism, has seen decreasing snowpack, a shorter snow season and a drying up of key irrigation, he said.In Farmington, New Mexico, Native American, Hispanic and Latino activists led a multi-coalition effort to dominate the hearing, with 60 people supporting reform and only three speaking against it.'Our lands are being auctioned off to coal companies for pennies,' said Colleen Cooley of Diné Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment. 'Our communities, specifically Diné tribe, have not prospered from coal for the last 50-plus years. Poverty and unemployment, we're still at 50 percent unemployment, we're still at poverty-level conditions ... We need to start transitioning to cleaner energy now.'The news was just as powerful from the public hearing in Washington, D.C.Citizens are standing up against the coal industry's loopholes -- and you can help too. The conversation has begun, and we need you to add your voice.

Don’t.Dorina Rosin, a Hawaii resident planning to give birth in the ocean surrounded by dolphins, is one of many moms-to-be featured in “Extraordinary Births,” a British documentary airing Wednesday night on the U.K.'s Channel 4.Rosin and her husband run a spiritual healing center in Hawaii and purportedly believe that the dolphins will make giving birth a better experience, according to the Metro.The couple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but dolphin experts said they wouldn’t be surprised if Rosin actually did give birth in the ocean.“I think there’s every possibility somebody’s doing it,” Hardy Jones, executive director of ocean conservation group Blue Voice, told HuffPost. “There are people who have this kind of belief that having a child with dolphins present is a good idea.”Jones, however, said he's familiar with the waters surrounding Hawaii, and they're not a safe place to be going into labor.“You have tiger sharks, hammerhead sharks. They do [also] have white sharks in Hawaii,” he said. “If a woman is going to be giving birth, she’s going to be extruding a certain amount of blood. Sharks are attracted by blood. … It’s dangerous for the mother, for her attendants, for the infant, and it’s also dangerous for the dolphins.”Jones said he didn’t think it was likely that the dolphins themselves presented much danger to the woman. “I have seen pregnant women in the water with dolphins, and they’re really fascinated with this,” he said. A dolphin’s sonar may enable the animal to detect a developing fetus in the womb, he added.Watch Rosin swim with dolphins at 38-weeks pregnant (story continues below):Not everyone agrees that the dolphins are necessarily benign. Lori Marino, founder and director of the Kimmela Center, an animal advocacy group focused on scientific research, emphasized that dolphins are unpredictable wild animals.“Dolphins are wild animals, and the notion that they care about an unborn fetus in a human and want to somehow help that child be born is preposterous,” she said.Even a friendly, well-intentioned dolphin could easily inadvertently hurt the woman or newborn, Marino added. “It’s a totally unnatural situation, and to put a newborn baby in that situation is totally irresponsible,” she said.And what about harm to the dolphins? The animals in the documentary are wild, so the ethical issues surrounding captive “swim with dolphins” programs -- where the animals suffer high levels of stress and trauma -- don’t apply.Even so, Marino said, anything that promotes the false idea that dolphins have special healing powers fuels the market for bogus programs like “dolphin-assisted therapy” -- a controversial form of animal-based therapy that providers claim can treat a host of physical and psychological ailments.“It’s basically based upon pseudoscience,” Marino said. Such programs not only scam people out of their money, she added, but if they use captive dolphins, they're also absolutely horrible for the animals.“These places will tell you ‘[the dolphins] want to be there, they have a mission to help people,’ and in fact they’ve either been either captured from the wild and taken away from their social groups, or they were born in captivity where they never get chance to ever really be a dolphin,” she said.Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.comAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Sea Snake And Horrifying Fish Get Locked In Battle To The Death", "text": "This circle of terror is, unfortunately, a very real battle of the poisonous captured off the coast of Australia, as if the country didn't have enough terrifying creatures already.The two beasts above, a sea snake and a fish that appears to be a venomous stonefish, were spotted by Australian spear-fisherman Rick Trippe off the coast of Darwin last week. They were very much alive when Trippe's boat stumbled across them, with the animals' mouths locked onto each other.

Stonefish are the most poisonous fish in the world, and can easily kill humans in two hours if victims aren't treated with antivenom.John C. Murphy, a sea snake expert with Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History, told National Geographic that fish are regular prey for the snakes. He told the outlet it's possible the snakes are immune to stonefish venom. The reptiles hunt by injecting the fish with venom, he said, holding them until they're subdued and then swallowing them whole.There's also a chance the fish is actually a nonvenomous frogfish, which look similar to a stonefish, biologist Bryan Fry told the outlet.

Far from it, in fact. I believed the hype. I bought into the stereotypes. I worked a job where I went into many different homes everyday, and I encountered many dogs that would be classified as pit bulls that were, shall we say, less than model canine citizens. All of that changed when my wife and I adopted our first pit bull, Karma. Karma not only changed my mind about this breed, but in the very short time she was on this planet, she changed many other minds as well. I've been advocating for the breed ever since. These dogs are amazing, and deserve to live a life free of discrimination, just like any other dog.Being the president of Bikers Against BSL, and a responsible pit bull parent, I get asked a lot of questions when our group is out advocating for breed neutral legislation. There are a lot of uphill battles that pit bull parents face on a daily basis. In an effort to help educate, I've put together this little list of the most commonly asked questions, and my answers to them.Question 1: Don't pit bulls have locking jaws?Answer: No. There have been scientific studies that have proven a pit bull's jaw is no different than any other dog. Don't believe me? I have proof: According to Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of Georgia,\"The few studies which have been conducted of the structure of the skulls, mandibles, and teeth of [American Pit Bull Terriers] show that, in proportion to their size, their jaw structure and thus its inferred functional morphology, is no different than that of any [other] breed of dog. There is absolutely no evidence for the existence of any kind of 'locking mechanism' unique to the structure of the jaw and/or teeth of the American Pit Bull Terrier.\"On top of that, let's examine the absurdity of this claim. If a dog, of any breed, had a locking jaw, that dog would be unable to eat, drink, or pant. This condition would kill said dog. If all pit bulls had locking jaws, then pit bulls would cease to exist on this planet.Question 2: Aren't pit bulls the only dogs to bite, hold, and shake?Answer: Not even close. Instead of trying to explain the drive behind this behavior, I will simply refer you to the following videos of dogs that could never be confused with pit bulls.http://youtu.be/kYJhgrgYImAhttp://youtu.be/ok4z5i-MoMshttp://youtu.be/tGk3lB8k-JIhttp://youtu.be/xWF5FG9IOJkhttp://youtu.be/nyGBQYHfKZAYou get the point.Question 3: I heard that pit bulls have the strongest bite force of any dog. Is that true?Answer: No. I've seen numbers from certain groups that range from 800 PSI, to well over 2000 PSI. First off, bite force isn't measured in PSI. The correct scientific measurement is Newtons (or pounds of force for us non metric folks) but when have the hate mongers ever let science get in their way before?Moving on from that, there was only one study I could find that actually measured bite force (in pounds of force). It was conducted by Dr. Brady Barr of National Geographic. He used a Rottweiler, a German Shepherd, and an American Pit Bull Terrier. The results were as follows:Rottweiler: 328 pounds of force German Shepherd: 238 pounds of force APBT: 235 pounds of forceQuestion 4: Aren't pit bulls the most likely dog to bite?Answer: Far from it. According to the American Temperament Test Society, in 2013 (latest info on their website), 86.8% of American Pit Bull Terriers passed their tests that involve stability, aggressiveness, friendliness, and protectiveness. Only 85.2% of Golden Retrievers passed, and only 69.8% of Chihuahuas passed.This covers the average person's questions and misconceptions about pit bulls. However, the problem doesn't just stop with them. Even advocates for these dogs contribute to misconception, misinformation, and, to use a terrible pun, are barking up the wrong tree when it comes to advocating.Advocate Misconception 1: The only pit bull is the American Pit Bull Terrier. If everyone just called these other dogs mutts, the statistics would go down.Truth: Where do I even begin here? I see this argument at least once a week. First off, let's talk about these statistics these folks mention. There is only one group still using perceived dog breed in bite statistics. This group is run by an amateur statistician, and his research (I use that term very loosely) is often touted as irrefutable proof of the plague of pit bulls by the media. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (you know, that government agency that does studies about everything) stopped keeping track of dog bite fatalities by breed, and has posted the following statement on their website,\"Because of difficulties inherent in determining a dog's breed with certainty, enforcement of breed-specific ordinances raises constitutional and practical issues. Fatal attacks represent a small proportion of dog bite injuries to humans and, therefore, should not be the primary factor driving public policy concerning dangerous dogs. Many practical alternatives to breed-specific ordinances exist and hold promise for prevention of dog bites.\"When nobody is using breed as a determining factor except an unqualified, self-proclaimed statistician who refuses to allow anyone to see his research , and who admittedly pulls his information from media reports, why do we care what his stats say? How does correctly classifying one dog as a mutt vs. a pit bull (notice I always use lower case unless referring to the APBT) help in this situation?Let's look at the flip side of this. Let's say that we magically get everyone to classify correctly overnight (never going to happen, see Kleenex vs. tissue for example), what does that do for Breed Specific Legislation? Now we have mutts biting people. Lawmakers that are quick to knee-jerk reactions, and look for Band-Aids instead of viable solutions are going to ban mutts. You're cool with that? Seriously? You have to look at the broader picture. This isn't just about pit bulls, it's about discrimination. It's about us blaming the wrong end of the leash. No dog, regardless of breed, should be discriminated against because of ignorance, fear, and lack of addressing the real issue.Advocate Misconception 2: It's all in how you raise them.Truth: My god, no. Please stop with this. You may think you're helping, but what you're actually doing is condemning millions of dogs to death with that statement. If it were all in how you raise a dog, how do you explain the Vick dogs? How do you explain dogs that were the victims of terrible abuse, and neglect? With the right owner, almost any dog can be a well-adjusted, well-balanced canine citizen.Advocate Misconception 3: Pit bulls are just like any other dogs vs. pit bulls are not just like any other dogs.Truth: This one is a tough call. I think, instead of advocates arguing this point back and forth between ourselves, we should all agree that each dog is unique, regardless of breed. What we are looking for is equality. To say that pit bulls are just like any other dog is to deny the things that make pit bulls unique. Their intelligence, their tenacity, their goofball nature, their desire to please, and their tendency to pile on top of each other into the most adorable thing you've ever seen.  Conversely, to say they're not like other dogs only perpetuates the misconceptions of the general public. Each dog is an individual, and should be regarded as such. If you can't get on my bus with this, then let's just all agree that pit bulls are amazing dogs that deserve a fair shot at happy, discrimination-free lives.In closing, I have a question for all of you. Should we then ban everything that has the potential to harm?There are many people that are quick to judge, and offer the solution that banning pit bulls will make the issue of dangerous dogs disappear. Let's look at things from a different point of view. In 2013, 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes, accounting for nearly one-third (31%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. This is a staggeringly tragic number. By comparison, in 2013, 31 people were killed in dog bite related fatalities.When a person is killed by an alcohol-impaired driver, the driver of the car is held responsible for that action, not the alcohol itself, or the vehicle they were driving. If we were take the position that things with the potential to be deadly should be banned, in this situation all motorized vehicles would be banned, as well as all alcohol. I understand that this is what is known as the Slippery Slope Logical Fallacy, but it illustrates the absurdity of Breed Specific Legislation. The logical, ethical and moral way to handle dangerous dogs is to place the responsibility back into the hands of the owners. Breed Neutral Legislation does just that.I hope these questions and answers have cleared things up for those not familiar with the physiology and temperament of the pit bull. I hope other advocates reading this reconsider their stance on these points. I also hope that, one day, I'll be able to shut down Bikers Against BSL permanently because dogs are no longer being discriminated against based off their appearance and misconceptions about them.

Only last November did it start using renewable energy to power some of these electricity-guzzling facilities. In addition, the company offers to recycle customers' old devices, but the program is far from comprehensive.\"The biggest hurdle to Amazon becoming an environmental leader is that the company has refused to embrace some basic transparency,\" David Pomerantz, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace, told The Huffington Post by phone. \"It's very difficult for its customers to hold it accountable.\"Amazon's cloud-computing service, which hosts some of the biggest sites on the web, earns about $6 billion annually. Earlier this year, major clients including Yahoo, Netflix and HuffPost demanded access to their electricity usage data, to no avail.\"Unfortunately we do not release this information to our customers,\" Amazon told HuffPost in May, after an engineer for the site requested such statistics.An Amazon spokeswoman, reached for comment on Wednesday, pointed HuffPost to a website outlining the cloud-computing unit's sustainability goals.\"It's hard to know what is the right amount of disclosure for that kind of information,\" Jonathan Koomey, a research fellow at Stanford University, said of the energy usage at data centers. \"But I don't think it's a proprietary issue at all to say we're using this percentage of renewable power.\"Other tech giants, by contrast, have offered more transparent reports on their data centers' energy consumption. Apple includes its facilities in its annual environmental responsibility report. Google maintains a page dedicated to the energy efficiency of its data centers. Facebook has posted video tours of one of its data centers, touting its energy efficiency since as far back as 2011.To boot, those three companies have made substantial investments in green energy outside their data centers. Apple last February committed $848 million to a solar farm meant to power its new headquarters. Google has made numerous substantial investments in renewables. Facebook has set ambitious goals to use clean energy to power half its operations by 2018.Amazon's shoddy record on recycling old electronics is put to shame when held up next to Best Buy, the struggling brick-and-mortar retailer whose lunch Amazon has grown plump eating. Despite its recent financial woes, from which it has begun to recover, Best Buy offers free recycling of customers' electronic waste, including TVs and computers, at its own expense.On its website, Amazon says it recognizes \"the importance of recycling electronic equipment at the end of its useful life.\" Yet, as The Guardian's Marc Gunther found, Amazon's own take-back program is limited to its own products, such as the Kindle eReader or failed Fire phone, and it requires customers to mail the defunct device in. At least with Best Buy there is a physical location to which customers can drive.To its credit, Amazon announced plans last November to power three data centers with renewable energy. Since then, the company has laid plans for two wind farms -- in Indiana and North Carolina -- and a solar farm in Virginia.\"Amazon has historically been one of the major tech companies that has been the slowest to embrace sustainability in its business practices,\" Pomerantz said. \"Amazon really was an outlier until November last year.\"Amazon's recent green initiative hasn't stopped it from opening other facilities that may use fossil fuels. The company faced fresh criticism after the cloud-computer division announced in June plans to open a data center in Columbus, Ohio, a city that relies heavily on coal. It's unclear how Amazon plans to power that facility.Such moves could prevent Amazon from shrinking its carbon footprint. If the company opens new locations as quickly as it converts others to renewable energy, its green commitments amount to little more than public relations plays.\"Amazon has started making some pretty significant progress,\" Pomerantz said. \"But it still lags behind some of its biggest peers and competitors in a big way.\""}, {"title": "Missing WWII-Era Shipwreck Finally Found In Waters Off Hawaii", "text": "After years of searching, researchers have finally found the missing wreckage of a World War II-era tanker in waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian islands.The wreckage of the USNS Mission San Miguel was discovered on August 3 by marine researchers aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel Hi'ialakai, it was revealed Friday.The 524-foot U.S. Navy tanker transported fuel in both World War II and the Korean War, but sank in October 1957 after hitting Maro Reef at full speed, damaging the hull beyond repair, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The Navy rescued all 42 members of the crew, but since the exact location of the sunken ship was not recorded, finding the wreck proved to be a challenge.Jason Raupp, the team's lead researcher, told the Star-Advertiser that high visibility and low wind levels were vital in finding the wreckage.\"Over the years people have searched for it. And you would expect that it wouldn't be that hard to find. But in fact we got really lucky,\" he said.Since 2006, the area surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, including Maro Reef, has been protected as part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, one of the largest marine conservation areas in the world. The area is thought to be home to as many as 60 shipwrecks, and many of them have never been found.In addition to looking for the ship, researchers aboard the NOAA expedition were also working on mapping and assessing coral reefs in the marine preserve. Since the waters around Maro Reef are prone to churning wave activity, the group was surprised to find the Mission San Miguel largely intact.\"I had to stare at it for a little bit,\" Rebecca Weible, a marine biology student who was one of the first divers to spot the wreck, told Hawaii News Now. \"I started freaking out underwater, just screaming and motioning.\"The ship was found lying on its side, 80 feet below the surface and nestled in a protected sandy area between reefs.

The exhibit is part of a linked presentation by the Fairfield Westchester Museum Alliance.The calm of the 28-acre public gardens, which overlooks the Hudson and the Palisades, is the essence of nature's beauty at rest.Inside, the tumultuous imagery is a different story.In mid-August, Wave Hill hosted a talk that featured Senior Curator Jennifer McGregor, Curator of Visual Arts Gabriel de Guzman, and artists Anne Peabody and Julie Heffernan.McGregor introduced the conversation, noting that Wave Hill had chosen to specifically investigate the wrath of nature as, \"Nature is so much bigger than us.\" Guzman remarked that the works presented were primarily paintings --referencing the long tradition that deals with this theme.Peabody introduced her piece by discussing her concern with weather patterns. In 1974, her town was destroyed by a tornado. While her house was left standing, it led her to question the subjects of fate, devastation, rebirth, and regeneration.Anne Peabody Wildfire, 2015 Copper, wood, glass Dimensions variable Courtesy of the artistHer site-specific installation incorporates outside greenery, riffing off of the ivy that climbs the exterior walls of the Glyndor Gallery. Using the fireplace and adjacent window as a jumping off place for her sculpture, Peabody explained that she wanted viewers to question, \"What happened here?\"Peabody replicates the growth pattern of the outside ivy, while contrasting it with her copper leaves -- each hand-cut and soldered on to the trailing, constructed vines. She achieves a range of tonalities by applying a chemical solution to individual pieces. Using ivy samples from the grounds, Peabody incorporated natural occurrences, such as insects and spider webs. The viewer is presented with a dialogue between the plant life and the human activity of building a fire. In the end, although the sculpture clearly speaks to destruction and devastation, the beauty of the overall piece captures the primal instinct towards life and hope.Anne Peabody Wildfire, 2015 Detail Courtesy of the artist Photo: Ken GoebelHeffernan, known for her female figures and still life canvases filled with art historical and symbolic references, believes in \"the power of an image to affect the viewer.\" Her landscapes, as she elaborated, present themselves via an internal \"image streaming process.\" Acknowledging the impact of literary sources, Heffernan related that she has been influenced by Elizabeth Kolbert's series on climate change. Heffernan asked and answered rhetorically, \"Will nature recover? It may, but will we be here?\"Akin to Peabody, Heffernan has a deep engagement with disintegration and regeneration. \"It's the idea of what do we want to keep versus what do we want to dispense with,\" she said. In Millennium Burial Ground, Heffernan portrays what she defines as a \"human decentered world.\" It is clear that the featured wolves have \"agency.\" There are sub-paintings revealing political subtext, and an encompassing lushness whether the subject is foliage, wildlife, or architecture.In Self-Portrait on the Edge, destruction and rebuilding co-exist.

Vessels and ports are major sources of the severe air pollution choking many coastal cities in China, which is home to eight of the ten busiest (and most densely populated) port cities in the world in terms of freight volume.First, the National People's Congress adopted a number of amendments to China's 15-year old Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law. Among other things, these provisions, for the first time, provide a clear legal foundation for the government to tackle shipping emissions. They also make clear the importance of making China's energy structure cleaner, so it relies less on coal, diesel and other high-polluting fossil fuels.The amended Air Pollution Law now requires the fuel used by ships while at berth to comply with government-set requirements for meeting emission standards. All new terminals should provide shoreside electric power so ships can turn off their diesel engines while at berth. Vessels must be certified for meeting national air emission standards in order to operate in China. The law prohibits the sale or import of nonconforming marine fuels and imposes heavy fines on violators. More details can be found in this summary.Most importantly, the law provides clear legal authority for national government's transport authority, i.e. China's Ministry of Transport (MOT), to set more stringent air pollution requirements for key port regions by designating them as Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The establishment of special Emission Control Areas is a key strategy for reducing air pollution. The North American ECA, for example, is anticipated to reduce particulate pollution by 74 percent by 2020.The newly amended Air Law also focuses on establishing various mechanisms to improve ambient air quality, including enhancing local governments' responsibilities for air quality management; formulating and implementing local attainment plans, particularly for non-attainment areas; and controlling major emission sources such as coal burning, industries, vehicles, vessels, dust and agricultural activities. In addition, the amended law includes a number of measures announced earlier in China's National Action Plan on Air Pollution Control, such as air pollution warning and risk mitigating systems, joint prevention and control mechanisms, public participation and supervision, and the emission trading system. Moreover, the amended law includes detailed provisions on punishment for violations and increases sharply the total penalty amount for some violations, which establishes a sound basis for effective implementation and enforcement of the law.Two days after the Air Law amendments were enacted, MOT issued a detailed Shipping and Ports Pollution Prevention and Control Implementation Plan. This is the first time that MOT has taken concrete action to address air emissions from ships and port activities. The implementation plan includes specific goals and timetables for setting up emission control zones around key port regions, constructing shore power facilities and promoting the use of liquid natural gas (LNG) by vessels. More details can be found in this summary.Finally, China's National Energy Administration issued a new grid and electricity distribution system plan that, among other things, requires shore power facilities to be installed at 50% of China's pilot ports by 2020.In a related development, the U.S. and Chinese governments have launched a new initiative on green ports and vessels. The purpose of this initiative is to work together to expand the environmental benefits of available technologies, experiences and best practices to mitigate emissions from ports and vessels and their impacts on air quality and climate.These exciting developments are a very important step towards meeting China's air pollution reduction and public health goals. NRDC stands ready to assist in these efforts."}, {"title": "Police Officer Caught On Video Hitting And Kicking K-9", "text": "A video that shows what appears to be a police officer whipping and kicking his K9 partner has the police scrambling to find out what went wrong."}, {"title": "Chris Christie Yells At Town Hall Attendee For Quoting His Own Comments On Climate", "text": "Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov.

Of course it does. We all contribute to it in one way or the other.

Named \"Pentecopterus\" in honor of the penteconter, an ancient Greek warship, the 467-million-year-old fossil predates the dinosaurs by a couple hundred million years.A study announcing the finding, published Tuesday in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, says that the nearly 6-foot-long Pentecopterus boasted a streamlined body, capped with a long head shield. A series of large limbs underneath helped it trap prey, likely soft, worm-like creatures based on the shape of its jaw, reports Newsweek.As an \"eurypterid\" arthropod, Pentecopterus is a distant relative to a number of modern animals, including ticks, spiders and lobsters.“This is the first real big predator.

Subsequent research on the fossil \"shows that eurypterids evolved some 10 million years earlier than we thought,\" Lamsdell said in a Yale press release, \"and the relationship of the new animal to other eurypterids shows that they must have been very diverse during this early time of their evolution, even though they are very rare in the fossil record.\"This story has been updated with comments from Dr. Lamsdell."}, {"title": "This Marmot Has A Really Irritating Scream", "text": "Listen to an adorable marmot scream on Blackcomb Mountain in British Columbia.That sound isn't so adorable, is it?

Ulrich, PhD, director of the Center for Health Systems and Design at Texas A&M University, \"discovered that patients whose hospital rooms overlooked trees had an easier time recovering than those whose rooms overlooked brick walls. Patients able to see nature got out of the hospital faster, had fewer complications and required less pain medication than those forced to stare at a wall.\" If that's what can happen when you're in recovery in a hospital, imagine the long-term implications day in and day out in your own home.The U.S. Forest Service reports that \"strategically placed trees save up to 56 percent on annual air-conditioning costs,\" while \"evergreens that block winter winds save up to 3 percent on heating.\" An article on \"Trees and Forests: Earth's Most Abundant Renewable Resource\" adds, \"Further temperature reductions occur when water droplets evaporate from the trees' leaves.\" Cut down on heating and air-conditioning costs? What's not to like about that?Furthermore, greening up your environment automatically makes you green, as in environmentally friendly. Trees may even help you grow a conscience. According to the Arbor Environmental Alliance, \"A single tree can absorb CO2 at a rate of 48 lbs. per year.\" In \"Do Trees Strengthen Urban Communities, Reduce Domestic Violence?\" W.C. Sullivan, PhD and Frances E. Kuo, PhD reported, \"We are finding less violence in urban public housing where there are trees. Residents from buildings with trees report using more constructive, less violent ways of dealing with conflict in their homes. They report using reasoning more often in conflicts with their children, and they report significantly less use of severe violence...in conflicts with their partners, they report less use of physical violence than do residents living in buildings without trees.\"So trees help promote world peace, or at least neighborhood peace. The green of trees promotes your psychological, physical and emotional well-being, all the while helping to lower some of your monthly bills. If you are considering purchasing a tree, be sure to look at a map of what trees will do well in the soil and climate in your part of the country. In general, trees tend to range in price from $50 to $200, though of course there are several more expensive options. Consider purchasing a few trees at a time and enlisting the help of an expert to help plant them to better ensure their healthy maturation.Once planted, trees also provide nice housing to local birds, insects and other animals.

Lehane previously spent recent years working with billionaire hedge fund manager and environmentalist Tom Steyer to prop up eco-friendly political candidates.The San Francisco-based Airbnb is Lehane's next big challenge, as he seeks to translate its more than 4o million guests and 1.5 million listings in 34,000 cities into a force for meaningful change.\"The platform is really people for people by people,\" Lehane told The Huffington Post. \"You have a community that is organizing itself and tends to be interested in policy and the world around them.\"Tech startups are quickly becoming major forces in local markets. Uber, for example, has used its lobbying might and enormous user base to influence local regulations, allowing it to operate virtually unencumbered by local taxi and livery rules in many places. Tesla Motors has challenged state regulations requiring auto manufacturers to sell cars through dealers, winning the right to vend its vehicles in all but a handful of states.Airbnb is particularly well-equipped to impact income inequality and climate change, Lehane said.The company was founded in San Francisco in 2008, around the time of the financial collapse that led to the Great Recession. By allowing users to list spare rooms online for budget-wary travelers to rent, the service was originally billed as a means of making ends meet. Though the super-rich have begun using it -- the site boasts more than 1,400 listings for castles -- Airbnb has largely stuck to its mission of democratizing the hospitality industry.Lehane said more than half of hosts currently listing their homes on the site earn middle-class incomes.\"I don't think there's another company that I'm aware of whose inherent product is addressing economic inequality,\" Lehane said. \"Well over 50 percent of users who are hosting are middle class folks who are saying they are hosting to supplement their income.\"By providing shelter to travelers in cities, the service helps reduce the need for more commercial hotels. Hotels accounted for 21 percent of the tourism industry's carbon emissions in 2008, according to the World Economic Forum.\"You have less of a carbon impact because you're using pre-existing housing and making incredibly efficient use of space that already exists,\" Lehane said of Airbnb.Of course, there are those who abuse the system.Nearly three-quarters of Airbnb rentals in New York City last year were illegal, according to a report released last October by Eric Schneiderman, the state's attorney general. Commercial operators -- not cash-strapped individuals -- maintained properties that attracted more than a third of all private reservations, with some landlords running illegal hostels that don't comply with local regulations. Individuals can also rent out their apartment in breach of their lease, potentially leading to complications for both guest and host.But an online marketplace such as Airbnb, as long as it remains a transparent platform for users, can become self-policing.\"You have to create mechanisms to make behavior visible and have a separation of power where parts of the system are checks on the others,\" Fred Kofman, a philosopher at LinkedIn who studies how business systems work and interact, told HuffPost. \"You need awareness, transparency and cross-checking. No single point of control will get the system on the trajectory of self-regulation.\"Airbnb attracts users who monitor other listings for shady activity in their cities, Lehane said.\"There's a social contract within the platform -- it really is a people-to-people platform,\" Lehane said. \"People care about where they live, the world they live in. And those people are willing to change to impact their actions.\""}, {"title": "This Grizzly Bear Thinks Your GoPro Sucks", "text": "This is what it's like to get smacked down by a grizzly bear.Naturalist Brad Josephs placed a GoPro camera in grizzly territory in Alaska to record the bears, and it wasn't long before one griz came over to investigate.After carefully checking to see if the camera might be dangerous -- and apparently deciding that it's not food -- the bear slapped it upside the lens.As the footage shows, it seems the camera is no worse for the wear.The clip was posted on YouTube last week by GoPro.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Man Buys Fire Truck To Help Protect Neighbors From Wildfires", "text": "Alex Thomason, a finalist a one-time finalist on The Apprentice, and a lawyer living in Pateros, outside Spokane, originally bought the old-fashioned fire truck to help protect his own home from the fire.

The BBC called the venom a potentially powerful “weapon against cancer.”In lab tests, MP1 was found to inhibit the growth of prostate and bladder cancer cells as well as leukemia cells that had been shown to be resistant to a variety of other drugs.The toxin interacts with fatty molecules known as lipids that are found on the outside of cancer cell membranes, researchers said. It then disrupts the structure of the protective membranes, creating “gaping holes” that allow molecules critical to the survival of the cancer cell to leak out.Study co-author Dr. João Neto of Brazil’s São Paulo State University said these “large” holes take “only seconds” to form.Since healthy cells don’t have these lipids on the outside (they are located on the cell's inner membrane), it seems they are not susceptible to the wasp toxin the way cancer cells are.“Cancer therapies that attack the lipid composition of the cell membrane would be an entirely new class of anticancer drugs,” Paul Beales, one of the study’s authors, stated in a news release. “This could be useful in developing new combination therapies, where multiple drugs are used simultaneously to treat a cancer by attacking different parts of the cancer cells at the same time.”Though the use of the wasp’s venom as a treatment option is an exciting possibility, it still remains theoretical.Beales, of the University of Leeds in the U.K., and his team said more research needs to be done to learn if and how the venom could be used for clinical purposes.“Understanding the mechanism of action of [MP1] will help in translational studies to further assess the potential for this peptide to be used in medicine,” Beales said. “As it has been shown to be selective to cancer cells and non-toxic to normal cells in the lab, this peptide has the potential to be safe, but further work would be required to prove that.”Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Fossil Fuel Execs Made Twice As Much As U.S. Pledged To Help Fight Climate Change Overseas", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The top executives at the largest publicly held fossil fuel companies in the United States have made nearly $6 billion in the last five years -- enough to double the U.S. commitment to addressing climate change abroad.A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, released Wednesday, analyzes the compensation for the top five executives at the 30 largest oil, gas and coal companies in the country as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which totaled $5.97 billion between 2010 and 2014.By comparison, the United States has committed $3 billion over four years to an international fund meant to help developing countries address climate change, and might have trouble coughing even that up if Republicans in Congress have their way in budget disputes.The CEOs analyzed in the report averaged $14.7 million in total compensation last year. ConocoPhillips head Ryan Lance and ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson topped the list at $27.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively.Tillerson has suggested both that climate change is not as big a deal as it's been made out to be, and that adapting to whatever change there is should be easy.The institute's report on executive pay, which it releases annually but is focusing on climate change for the first time, argues that the incentives and overall pay structure for executives is hindering climate action. Many are compensated through stock options, which creates an incentive to focus on raising share prices in the short term. And while all of the companies surveyed reward executives for expanding fossil fuel reserves, none of them had such incentives for expanding investments in renewable energy, the paper argues.\"I think our numbers show that CEO pay encourages executives to behave in a way that is deepening the climate crisis,\" said Sarah Anderson, global economy project director at the Institute for Policy Studies, in an interview with The Huffington Post. \"If we don't reverse these perverse incentives, we all remain at risk.\"Previous studies have found that the world cannot burn all the fossil fuels currently in reserves without far exceeding the 2 degree Celsius limit on global temperature rise that world leaders have agreed to in international negotiations.\"Executives are still clinging to this business model that is locking us into a destructive climate path,\" Anderson said.The total compensation also puts into perspective the amount currently pledged to help developing nations address climate change. World leaders have committed just over $10 billion in total to get that fund off the ground -- so the pay of the top fossil fuel executives in the U.S. is more than half that.\"Climate change can seem so overwhelming, the costs associated with addressing it seem so massive,\" Anderson said. \"But when we boiled down and compared it to the compensation being pocketed by so few executives, it really puts things into perspective.\""}, {"title": "Fox News Host: Obama Should Work For Weather Channel If He's So Obsessed With Climate Change", "text": "Hosts on Fox News’ “The Five” are not happy that President Barack Obama is spending time addressing climate change while in Alaska this week.“To me, it’s such a glaring example of priorities askew,” host Kimberly Guilfoyle said, arguing that the president should be focusing on escalating crime rates instead of climate change. “I fail still at this point to understand where he’s coming from because I don’t speak the language he speaks. ...

The name, which means \"High One\" or \"Great One,\" replaces that of former President William McKinley, who never even saw the place.But what if the president used his executive power to restore the indigenous names of other monuments, parks and places?Here are six places across the country ready to get the Denali treatment.Devil’s TowerMatȟó Thípila, \"Bear Lodge\" (Lakota)The name for Devil’s Tower, a monolithic rock formation in northeastern Wyoming created by millions of years of volcanic activity and erosion, comes from a mistranslation of \"Bad God’s Tower,\" which a scout serving under Lt. Col. Richard Irving Dodge erroneously bestowed on the monument in 1875. The name has been a subject of controversy ever since, as the monolith figures prominently in the cultural and spiritual beliefs of many indigenous nations on the plains, including the Lakota, Arapaho, Crow, Cheyenne, Kiowa and Shoshone.Lakota medicine man Arvol Looking Horse is leading a push to rename Devil’s Tower \"Bear Lodge,\" which is an accurate translation of the cliff’s Lakota name, Matȟó Thípila. Looking Horse says the current name is offensive \"because it equates cultural and faith traditions practiced at this site to 'devil worship,' in essence equating indigenous people to 'devils.'\"YosemiteAhwahnee, \"Gaping Mouth-Like Place\" (Ahwahneechee Paiute)While in pursuit of the Ahwahneechee in 1851, a battalion of California soldiers became the first European-Americans to set foot in the region. The battalion renamed the valley Yosemite, borrowing the Miwok term for the Ahwahneechee: yohhe'meti, which means \"they are killers.\" That would later become the name of the national park when it was created in 1890.But the Ahwahneechee knew their homeland as Ahwahnee, which means \"Gaping Mouth-like Place.\" The last of the Ahwahneechee were evicted from the area in 1969, and their homes were burned down in a firefighting drill.Grand CanyonHavasu, \"Blue-Green Water\"  (Havasupai)The Havasupai tribe once claimed a vast territory surrounding the Grand Canyon, but now live on a small reservation in Havasu Canyon, on the south side of the Colorado River, completely surrounded by the park. They call themselves the \"people of the blue-green waters,\" after the spectacular streams and waterfalls in their homeland. The name of Havasu Creek is taken from their language.Spanish explorer García López de Coronado \"discovered\" the  Gran Cañón,   or Grand Canyon, in 1540,  while under orders from conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado to find the mythical Siete Ciudades de Cíbola, or Seven Cities of Gold. President Theodore Roosevelt later designated the canyon a national monument in 1908, and it became a national park in 1919.Mount St. HelensLawetlat’la,  \"The Smoker\" (Cowlitz)Explorer George Vancouver named Mount St. Helens after his friend, Baron St. Helens, in 1792. Mount St. Helens is central to the oral history of the Cowlitz and Yakama nations in Washington state. The Cowlitz name for the mountain is Lawetlat’la, which translates as \"The Smoker,\" and derives from the mountain’s volcanic nature. The mountain violently erupted in 1980.Mount RainierTahoma , \"Ice-Capped Mountain\" (Puyallup)George Vancouver named Mount Rainier after another friend, Admiral Peter Rainier, who fought for the British against the Americans in the Revolutionary War. The mountain is just 54 miles southeast of Seattle, and can be seen from the Seattle metropolitan area. The Puyallup called the mountain Tahoma, which is almost identical to Seattle’s neighboring city of Tacoma.

I literally could not walk one block in the afternoon sun without feeling as though I would faint. After leaving the sauna of the Southwest with much relief, I returned home, only to find myself immersed in the steam bath of the Northeast.Or maybe I should say, \"submerged.\" I stepped off of the plane and into a pot of boiling soup. The air was hot, but worse, it was swampy. The second that I left the terminal, I began to perspire. The sweat started at my hairline and dripped down my face and neck. It poured through my pores and drenched my clothes. And I have been soaking wet ever since. Not a particularly pleasant feeling.When I complained about the oppressive heat while I was in the viciously hot deserts of the Southwest, folks kept telling me that at least it was dry heat. I was not consoled one tiny bit. I was miserable. But even though I felt completely overwhelmed and debilitated by the desert heat, I hadn't really broken a sweat.\"It's not the heat, it's the humidity,\" people told me. And you know, I didn't believe them at the time, but they turned out to be right. It is most definitely the humidity.\"Why is that?\" I wondered. So I set about to find out.Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humans and animals are very sensitive to humidity, as we rely on the air to get rid of the moisture that has accumulated on our skin as perspiration. This cools us and keeps our body temperature at an acceptable level. When the humidity is high, the cooling evaporation of sweat from the skin is decreased.As a result, we feel much hotter than the actual temperature when the humidity is high. If the humidity is low, we can feel much cooler than the actual temperature because our sweat evaporates easily, cooling us off.Humidity combined with hot temperatures makes the heat more dangerous. If the atmosphere is as warm or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, the blood is brought to the surface of our body and it cannot lose its heat, resulting in a condition called hyperpyrexia.With so much blood going to the external surface of our body, relatively less goes to our muscles, brain and internal organs. So we feel weak and tired, physically and mentally, both. If there is no relief, this can result in hyperthermia or heat stroke.The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that at any one time the Earth has about 3,100 cubic miles of water in the air mostly in the form of vapor, but also as clouds and precipitation. There are 326 million cubic miles of water on our planet -- flowing and frozen -- including all of the water in the oceans, lakes, rivers and streams, the deposits underground and the water locked in ice.Though the water vapor in the air represents such a small percentage of Earth's water, it would be a very different planet without it. If the air on Earth didn't contain humidity, our weather would be unrecognizable. Mars-like. There would be no clouds (except dust), no rain, sleet or snow. No thunder. No lighting. No fog.I guess the ground can absorb but so much moisture. All the rest of it apparently goes right back into the air. Even places that once had a dry atmosphere, like Phoenix, for example, have now become humid due to the preponderance of swimming pools, well-groomed golf courses with sprinkler systems, and fancy malls with spouting fountains.Humidity plays an important part in global climate. Water vapor, like carbon dioxide, is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases are responsible for depleting the ozone layer and heating the planet. Which causes us to use more air conditioning. Which releases Freon and other hydrocarbons, also greenhouse gases that warm the air even more. And warm air, it would seem, can hold more water than cold air. This is a most vicious cycle.July was Earth's hottest month ever, and 2015 is on pace to be the warmest year on record. I shudder to think what it will be like in the future. It makes me sweat just to think about it.\"When it is hot I sweat alot.  When I sweat I feel the intense of heat.  Heat give off light. Light give off energy.  Energy give off of electricity.  Electricity give off shot.  Shot and then you get dead.\"-Denise Baque, Grade 6, Queens, NY"}, {"title": "Governor Jindal's Dopey Letter", "text": "What governor had the temerity to set limitations on what a sitting American president could say during a state visit?The governor in question is Louisiana's Bobby Jindal. He took the occasion to breach traditional political etiquette as well as respect for the Oval Office. In a letter to the president, Jindal warned Obama not to mention climate change in a New Orleans-based speech commemorating the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It was embarrassingly transparent grandstanding to shift the spotlight away from Obama's visit and energize Jindal's sputtering presidential campaign.The Louisiana governor began the letter by welcoming Obama to the city, but the prose went downhill from there. It was laden with snide jibes at Obama, some subtle, some not so subtle. There was a back-handed swipe at Obama's home town of Chicago compared to New Orleans, and an admonition not to \"lecture\" on climate change since that would somehow \"diminish\" Louisiana's hurricane recovery effort.Jindal wrote that the \"hope and change\" Obama promised to deliver was attained by the people of New Orleans quite nicely on their own, thank you.In his letter, Jindal cautioned Obama not to politicize the celebration of the city's recovery.\"There is a time and place for politics, but this is not it,\" the governor intoned. He then proceeded to rattle off what he considered to be his political accomplishments, especially in relation to the state's economy and educational programs. Following that recitation is when he advised Obama to refrain from including climate change in any speech to the crowds in New Orleans.Here was a governor under whose aegis the state of Louisiana was continuing to lose industrial-ravaged coastline daily to climate change-related rising sea levels. No wonder Jindal did not want Obama to touch on the topic.While Jindal urged Obama to skip any reference to environmental controversies, such a code of silence did not apply to the governor. In his letter he offered his own take on climate change, launching a partisan rant in which he accused Obama of trying to \"legislate away hurricanes with higher taxes, business regulation, and EPA power grabs.\"Jindal \"requested\" that Obama not inject the divisive political agenda of liberal environmental activism\" into the visit.If Obama ignored this advice and instead incorporated partisan politics into his New Orleans speech, Jindal warned, he would \"meet with nothing but derision.\"Did Obama bow to Jindal's admonitions and omit a caution about the climate change threat in saluting the city's recovery?Gubernatorial censorship wasn't Obama's \"cup of tea\"--and the president was met with applause, not \"derision.\""}, {"title": "The US Just Made Its Largest Investment In Renewable Energy Yet", "text": "Climate News Network: Solar power takes giant strides as prices fallThe U.S. government just made its largest renewable energy purchase to date.The U.S. Navy has invested an undisclosed amount in the Mesquite solar farm in sun-rich Arizona, allowing for an expansion of the facility that is anticipated to make it the world’s largest solar farm.As the Climate News Network’s Paul Brown reports, the farm -- located about 40 miles west of Phoenix -- will provide 210 megawatts of direct power, a third of the energy needed to power 14 Navy and Marine Corps sites. The solar farm, slated to go online next year, is expected to save the Navy “at least” $90 million in energy costs over the course of the 25-year contract with Sempra U.S. Gas and Power, which operates it.The Mesquite facility, which completed its first phase of buildout in late 2012, has a potential capacity of 700 megawatts, which would power up to 260,000 homes. It requires no water to operate and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, according to Sempra.The investment marks a big step toward the Department of Defense’s Congress-mandated goal to either produce or procure 25 percent of its total energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, the Navy announcement noted.Meanwhile, India has also set its sights on creating the world’s largest solar farm. The country announced last month that it will build a 750-megawatt plant on 1,500 acres of barren, government-owned land in the northeastern Madhya Pradesh state. The plant, however, is not expected to be in operation until 2017.The increased interest in solar energy comes amid a new report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency showing that the cost of producing electricity from solar and other renewable sources has decreased \"significantly\" in recent years; they are no longer \"cost outliers\" when compared to fossil fuels, Bloomberg reports.MORE:Wired: This Girls' Summer Camp Could Help Change the World of AIFastCompany: How Teenage Activist Malala Yousafzai Is Turning Her Fame Into A MovementThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

Some people thought we were a little nuts, but to our editors and me, it made perfect sense.Our magazine is a handbook for living naturally in the modern world, and water influences every aspect of our lives. It quenches our thirst, buoys our spirits, inspires us with its tranquil (or tempestuous, depending on the weather!) beauty. And the health of our bodies, our homes, our gardens, and our food--all of it--depends on good, clean water.Conversely, good, clean water depends on us. Turning the tide on water waste and pollution might seem like a tall order, but there's a lot we can all do in our everyday lives that make a big difference.Here are 15 easy things you can do for the world's waters, starting today!1. Opt for organics. You already know that organic food is better for you. Did you also know that organic crops are more water efficient than conventional? The soil on organic farms retains far more water, preventing erosion and runoff and helping the crops weather times of drought.2. Veg out. A pound of beef takes 1,850 gallons of water to produce; a pound of veggies takes about 39. Two meatless days a week cuts your water footprint by 16 percent. Pass the kale, por favor!3. Drink dry-farmed wines. From 2003 to 2013, we took out more water than was replenished in 21 of the world's 37 largest aquifers. Much of that went to thirsty farms and vineyards. The good news? It turns out that wine quality is generally improved when there is little or no irrigation. Try wines from Frog's Leap Winery in Napa, for instance, which makes acclaimed wine while saving 65,000 gallons per acre every year by dry-farming. We can all raise a glass to that!4. Clean up your dish soap. Certain suds wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystems. Avoid products with harmful chemicals--sodium laureth sulfate, triclosan, methylisothiazolinone, ammonia, and bleach. Check out the Environmental Working Group's recommended list of soaps for more info.5. Give bottles the boot. Over a quarter of it sold comes from the tap anyway! Carry a filled canteen instead of buying one-time-use plastic bottles of water. (If you're travelling overseas where the taps don't run so clean, purify tap water with iodine tablets or tote a filter bottle like the collapsible Vapur.6. Get wet! Connect with the blue stuff by swimming, kayaking, and sailing responsibly. Surfers can ride the environmentalist wave with surfrider.org. Scuba fans can dive deeper into conservation work with projectaware.org.7. Sweep, don't spray. Rather than hosing down your patio, which wastes water and carries contaminants into freshwater systems, sweep it! Bonus: The exercise will help you burn a few extra calories.8. Eat sustainable seafood. Use buying guides like Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch and NOAA's FishWatch to find the best choices.9. Make your roof part of the solution.

The friends were shocked by the sight, but the surprises didn't end there. They saw another kitten swimming toward them as well, and after saving the first feline, the second furball was plucked out of the water, too.Frost and Key documented the incredible rescue on camera and shared it on social media, where it went viral with more than 1.5 million views and over 33,000 shares on Facebook as of Tuesday afternoon. It's completely understandable that the video's so popular. It's not every day you find yourself \"catfishing,\" as the pair call it and save some adorable kittens' lives.The friends were fishing in an area that wasn't near any houses so they believe that somebody must have left them there, Frost told AL.com. Luckily, the pair brought them to safety and played with their new furry friends, according to BuzzFeed News.A family ended up adopting the pair soon after the rescue.Frost said that this fishing trip they won't be forgotten.\"Everybody always has a crazy fishing story, and that's all it is, is a story,\" he said. \"If I wouldn't have had this on video, everybody would have thought I was crazy.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Radiation in the Ocean", "text": "Image: The spots monitored for Fukushima radiation by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.The West Coast of the United States seems under siege by negative environmental news: earthquake predictions, oil spills, drought, critically diminished water supply, wildfires, and numerous accounts of unusual coastal events: algae blooms, whale strandings, cancer in seals, collapse of fish stocks, and more.How to explain? Well, much of this can be attributed to climate factors where rising temperatures have resulted in multiple inter-related consequences: limited glacial melt, increased evaporation, no water, dry land, and the inevitable fire darkening that pristine Pacific air with smoke and ash the length of the coast.The ocean phenomena may be different. The warming of the ocean surely has an impact on changing growth patterns of marine plants and animals, just as the changing pH or acidity of the ocean has been shown to modify habitat and migrations. But what else?One argument has been the effect of radiation leaking from the three nuclear power plant reactors shut down by the earthquake and resultant tsunami tidal wave that inundated Fukushima, Japan in 2011, and has been thereafter distributed by ocean currents; indeed there is evidence of a plume of increased concentration of Cesium-134, and other radioactive elements that have been observed at unprecedented levels, spreading out some 5,000 miles into the Pacific toward North and South America. In April of this year, there were headlines declaring that \"Fukushima radiation has reached the North American Shore\" and concerns were raised, spread through the Internet and press, that this was surely the cause of these otherwise inexplicable anomalous natural events.There is no Federal agency that funds monitoring of radiation in coastal water, and the present effort, conducted since 2004 by Ken Buesseler, a marine chemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, has been underwritten by crowd-funding and the efforts of volunteers taking samples to provide data on cesium isotopes along the west coast of Alaska, the U.S. mainland coast, and Hawaii, the information that has been used to model potential distribution and concentration of any contamination. A comparable effort has been launched in Canada, led by Jay Cullen of the University of Victoria in collaboration with government, academic, and NGO partners.The radioactivity has been decreased by time, the natural half-life of the isotopes, and by dilution in a very large and deep body of water. In their samples, Buesseler and his \"citizen scientists\" did detect cesium-137 already in the waters as a result of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 60s, and cesium-134 which does not otherwise occur naturally in the ocean and can only be attributed to Fukushima, to serve as a first baseline for subsequent collection, analysis, modeling, and conclusion.Buesseler channels his research through the Center for Marine and Environmental Radioactivity at the Woods Hole Institute, where he offers a preliminary conclusion that \"the amount of cesium-134 reported in these new offshore data is less that 2 Becquerels (a radioactive measure) per cubic meter (the number of decay events per second per 260 gallons of water.) This Fukushima-derived cesium is far below where one might expect any measurable risk to human health or marine life, according to international health agencies. And it is more than 1,000 times lower than acceptable limits in drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\"Buesseler continues, \"We emphasize that cesium-134 has not been detected YET as it has been detected offshore of North America by Canadian oceanographers... The uncertainty in the predictions by these ocean models only emphasizes the importance of collecting samples from along the shores. Remember too that those models predict interacting levels of both cesium isotopes for the next 2 or 3 years, the highest published prediction is for 20 to 30 Becquerels per cubic meter, or well below what is thought to be of human health and fisheries concerns.\"So, yes, and no. No definitive conclusion, no clear argument that radiation is the cause of those coastal events which distress us so. There is no solace in uncertainty, just as there is no certainty without evidence. The question is immensely important and thanks to Ken Buesseler and all those volunteers alongshore and in research vessels who are working to provide the substance for a real answer."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - September 1, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: President Obama makes powerful case for climate action on the edge of the melting Arctic; 2015 hurricane season enters weird, record-breaking territory; Huge news for electric cars; PLUS: Rightwingers apoplectic over renaming of nation's tallest mountain...

In most states, if you want to remain within the confines of the law, you call the police or animal control -- and hope they get there in time.A bill under consideration in the Florida Senate would let good Samaritans take action -- by way of a hammer -- if an animal is in distress.The Protecting Animal Welfare and Safety Act was introduced Monday by state Sen. Dorothy Hukill (R).Under the bill, someone who sees a pet trapped in a hot car may \"use reasonable force\" to get it out. The rescuer would not be held civilly or criminally liable. The person who left the animals in the hot car may be subject to criminal penalties.Hukill told The Huffington Post the P.A.W.S. Act was inspired by a multitude of recent stories about animals that were left in hot cars and \"suffered injury or death.\"“Pets are extremely vulnerable to heat-related injury or death if left in a vehicle, especially on a hot day,” Hukill said in a statement, as reported by a Florida news service. “Individuals who risk their pets’ lives by leaving them in hot cars need to be held accountable.”There are limitations: The bill wouldn't give wholesale license to go around smashing car windows. Attempts must first be made to find the pet's owner. And then an actual go-ahead to break the glass must be granted by a police officer, firefighter, 911 operator or other law enforcement official.Additionally, farm animals seem to be exempted from the bill's protections: \"This section does not prohibit the transportation of horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, or other agricultural animals in motor vehicles designed to transport such animals for agricultural purposes.\"It's this restriction that gives Animal Legal Defense Fund attorney Carney Anne Nasser pause.\"The Animal Legal Defense Fund applauds Senator Hukill for her leadership on this issue,\" Nasser said in an email, \"but encourages the Florida legislature to pass a version of the P.A.W.S. Act that would not only protect dogs and other companion animals from suffering in hot vehicles, but pigs, cows and other factory farmed animals who suffer just as much when subjected to extreme temperatures and deprivation of water during transport to slaughterhouses in overcrowded tractor trailers.\"Kate MacFall, Florida state director for the Humane Society of the United States, agrees that this bill codifies the general feeling that \"a good Samaritan should be able to help rescue a pet baking to death in an unattended car.\"But, she added, \"there’s no reason any animal -- whether a dog, cat, chicken or pig --- should suffer this cruel fate.\"Hukill said she is open to finding \"ways to make this bill better\" that will balance Florida's agricultural practices with animal welfare concerns.She is feeling confident, too, that companion legislation will be offered in the Florida House of Representatives.In the meantime, Hukill hopes to raise awareness about the dangers of pets in hot cars, and encourage folks to leave their furry friends home on warm days, instead of risking the animals' lives (not to mention their car windows and a criminal record).\"I think it's needed,\" Hukill said. \"We're a country that loves our pets.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Maddow: Is Obama Being Hypocritical On Climate Change?", "text": "President Barack Obama's trip to Alaska to push for action on climate change is being met with a bit of backlash not only from environmental groups, but also from the media.MSNBC host Rachel Maddow asked Monday if Obama's recent climate change rhetoric is hard to reconcile with his administration's decision to allow off-shore drilling in the Arctic, a measure environmental groups have said is \"hypocritical\" of the president.\"I mean, it is hard to square the president talking about climate change in these very aggressive terms in Alaska ... with the green light he just gave to drill the Arctic for oil up there,\" Maddow said on her program Monday.The host asked NBC News's senior White House correspondent Chris Jansing if the administration hopes that the drilling will be overlooked when Obama's legacy on climate change is assessed.\"I mean, does the White House think that that is something people should sort of overlook when it comes to the president's legacy on climate change?\" she said. \"Or are they making the case for it not being as bad as seems?\"Jansing responded by saying the administration is making a case that climate change is much larger than one issue, while environmental leaders continue to call out the president.\"They're making a case, and I have to say, some of the environmental leaders of major groups that I've talked to out-and-out called him a hypocrite for deciding to go ahead with the Shell lease -- which we should say, to be fair, started in the Bush Administration,\" she said. \"Here's what the president has to say about this: We are trying to go to more sustainable fuels, but we're not there yet. In the mean time, the reality is, we have to have an energy-driven economy.\"Jansing pointed out that the administration has said in a video, released by the White House prior to Obama's official trip to Alaska, that the current leases have the strongest protections in them of any leases the U.S. has had.Watch the White House's video here:"}, {"title": "Michigan's Republican Governor Says State Will Comply With Obama's Climate Plan", "text": "Michigan Gov.

The administration set emission reduction targets for each state, but directed the states to come up with their own compliance plans.A group of Republican attorneys general almost immediately filed suit to block the rules, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been encouraging governors to ignore the EPA's regulations.But Snyder's office said Tuesday that developing its own compliance plan is in the state's best interest. \"Bottom line -- we believe it’s best for Michigan to be driving our energy policy and plans, not the feds,\" Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said in an email to The Huffington Post.\"While the multi-agency state review of the utility carbon rule is ongoing, we have determined that with participation from our stakeholders, Michigan can forge a reasonable path to compliance,\" said Dan Wyant, director of the state's department of environmental quality.As MLive reports, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) was among those who filed suit to block the rules. Schuette has said he is \"deeply concerned\" that the plan \"causes the price of electricity to increase, placing jobs at risk and costing Michigan families more.\"But Valerie Brader, the director of the Michigan Agency for Energy, said Tuesday that her office believes the final rules improve upon the draft version released in 2014, and that they give the state more time to comply.“While the EPA did not accept all of our suggestions to improve its proposed rule, they did recognize our concerns about competitiveness in energy production,\" said Brader. \"Michigan has made significant progress in recent decades to clean up its power production, and the EPA’s final rule recognizes our progress compared to other states in the region.\""}, {"title": "This Fantastically Enormous Feline Will Inspire You To Adopt A Black Cat Of Your Own", "text": "It's not just that Nero the cat is very large.

At 12 weeks old, Timian recalls Nero weighing about 5 pounds -- not the sort of early girth portending this later size.A typical reaction to her boy is, \"Wow, that's a big cat!!\" But the reaction she'd like to get is inspiring more people to take home black cats of their own.\"Black cats are the some of the sweetest cats around,\" Timian says. \"Nevertheless, they are the last to be adopted.\"This guy, having been one of the lucky ones, spends his day napping, having his chin scratched and climbing up on the counter.Nero also likes helping with laundry and wrestling with the household's other two cats -- his littermate Lily, who weighs a mere 18.5 pounds, and an adopted friend, 11-pound Redcat Rocket.All this is punctuated, of course, with regular snacks, because a cat doesn't stay 25 pounds by going on a diet.Once his work is done, Nero's nights, then, are in the family bed, tucked between Timian and her husband.\"As big as he is, we are bigger!\" she says.Speaking of bigger: Sinclair tells The Huffington Post that large as he is, Nero is healthy.Sinclair loves working with cats because of their unique characteristics.

Gerald Bailey, tells Oilprice.com in an exclusive interview that his hunt for an innovative technology that simultaneously makes money and cleans up the environment is over. The race to capitalize on Utah's vast oil sands resources is on, and only the 'clean' -- both financially and environmentally -- will survive.Coming hot off of the successful launch of clean oil sands operations in Utah, while other oil sands projects are under fire from protesters, Dr. Bailey discusses:• The difference between Utah and Alberta when it comes to oil sands resources. • How new technology can -- and is -- extracting oil sands without harming the environment. • Why the new technology is as much about remediation as it is about extraction • How to create new revenue streams and use the resulting clean sand for other purposes. • Why it's finally possible to make money extracting oil from oil sands cleanly -- despite the current world's depressed oil prices. • What Alberta's tailings ponds look like now, and what could be done to clean them up -- eventually.Interview by James Stafford of Oilprice.comJames Stafford: After many years of oil companies attempting to develop Utah's vast oil sands deposits without harming the environment, where are we now?Gerald Bailey: Right now, we're experiencing an exciting moment in the history of oil sands technology. For the first time, we can finally extract oil from Utah's oil sands without any environmental damage. And significantly, we can do it at a cost that makes sense, even in this depressed oil price environment. It's taken decades for someone to come up with this technology and actually make it commercially viable; and it was these elements that attracted me to MCW Energy. I wanted to get involved in this project while it was still new and largely off investor radar -- now it's poised to explode as an additional source for independent American oil production.James Stafford: So, oil sands don't necessarily have to be dirty?Gerald Bailey:  No, oil sands in themselves are not dirty. It is quite simply sand that contains oil, just like sand underground in an oilfield contains oil. They are dark with oil. The word 'dirty' has been derived from the fact that most current extraction processes use hot water or steam, which results in an oily water stream that leaves behind toxic tailings ponds.James Stafford: How is this new proprietary extraction technology developed by MCW Energy different? How does it work?Gerald Bailey: It's really quite simple. The technology works in the same way as soap takes grease off plates: The grease adheres to the soap and pulls it away and off the plate. Our technology -- which focuses on proprietary solvents -- works in the same way. It adheres to the oil and pulls it away from the sand.James Stafford: What happens with the sand after this process?Gerald Bailey: Well, that depends on what other local market uses there are. Generally speaking, we wash the sand with our solvents and then return it to the earth 99.9 percent clean. You can grow plants on it and it is no longer contaminated with oil.James Stafford: And are there any other uses for this sand? Is there any kind of a market for this once it's been cleaned up?Gerald Bailey: As I mentioned, for now the sand is usually returned to the earth -- clean and safe. But there are other potential applications that we are exploring. One possibility is to sell the cleaned sand as frack sands, which is a spin-off business that's growing as fracking activities in America increase. Frack sands require certain quantities of silicon and not all sands are equal in this respect. Much of the desired frack sand comes from the Midwest -- from Wisconsin and Michigan, for instance. For years Utah oil sands containing bitumen/asphalt have been used in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado to build roads and highways.James Stafford: So the immediate term goal is to focus on ramping up production in Utah and then licensing the technology for global application?Gerald Bailey: Yes. MCW has achieved commercial viability already through a fully operational oil sands plant in Asphalt Ridge, in the heart of the Utah oil reserves both in sands and in conventional reservoirs, near the town of Vernal. It's termed \"America's first environmentally-friendly oil sands extraction project.\" Since the beginning of this year, we have been cleaning Utah's oil sands and selling the oil to the market.James Stafford: Why Utah?Gerald Bailey: Asphalt Ridge is one of Utah's 8 major oil sand deposits. Asphalt Ridge alone is believed to hold some 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Utah has some 55 percent (Department of Energy Estimate: 32 billion barrels) of the United States oil sands deposits.James Stafford: How much is the project producing now and what are the forecasts?Gerald Bailey: The project is producing 250 barrels a day right now at a very reasonable production cost of $30 per barrel, with plans to build a 5,000/bpd plant, which could bring costs down to $20 per barrel. Even in this current world market, those numbers mean profit. While Alberta's oil sands are expensive to produce oil using their existing technologies, and are very troubled right now, MCW can make a profit on Utah's oil sands even with oil at $40 per barrel. And that's what today's market is all about -- innovations that spell profit even in times of crisis. Finding a company that has no debt -- such as MCW -- in this atmosphere was a huge selling point for me.James Stafford: How do you convince the public of the prospects of clean oil sands for Utah given the international outcry about Canada's dirty oil sands?Gerald Bailey: That is the challenge. Certainly, Canada has given oil sands a bad name and that is unfortunate, but the process and situation in Utah is entirely different and the two cannot be compared.  Utah oil sands are found in a different position -- much of Utah's oil sands deposits lie from surface to just 400 feet. You can just scoop up the oil sands with a front loader and then process it with MCW's proprietary solvents. The oil comes out and you sell the oil and put the sand back in the environment.In comparison, Canada's oil sands have to be mined because they are several hundred feet deep and the oil needs to be extracted with steam. The resultant polluted water returns to surface with residual oil that cannot be separated. This dirty water and sludge is stored in huge tailings ponds, so large I understand they can be seen from space. Utah's sands are oil wet, rather than water wet, eliminating the need for tailings ponds.James Stafford: What does this really mean for the environment?Gerald Bailey: We are here to clean up the oil sands business -- for now, starting in Utah. And any savvy investor knows that technology that is environmentally-friendly and commercially viable rules the day. This is already a proven, cost-effective technology. Our main technology process advantage is that we require no water to extract hydrocarbons from the oil sands. Almost all other technologies require up to 3 barrels of water for every barrel of oil produced.Utah being largely a desert state, usage of water for resource development is an extremely touchy issue. Our system features a closed-loop technology....nothing leaves the system except the cleaned sands and oil. And after tweaking our process, we've managed to dramatically reduce our labor costs, decrease the costs of the petroleum products we use in extraction and, increase our process efficiencies -- all which result in the lowest production costs in the industry. Our next step is to share this technology with the rest of the world. For now, that means anywhere that has oil sands deposits similar to Utah's.James Stafford: Are you talking about a technology that extracts oil sands in an environmentally-friendly manner, or does it have broader environmental applications?Gerald Bailey: Oh, the environmental applications are much broader. Our process may also be viewed as a remediation technology. This is not just an opportunity to get in on another source for oil, but also an opportunity to clean up the land after disasters or the resulting polluted tailings ponds resulting from other less efficient extraction processesJames Stafford: Are you suggesting such a technology could have played a role in cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, for example?Gerald Bailey: I am. We could have applied our technology there and cleaned up significant areas of the contaminated beach. If you go there right now, you can still find a lot of polluted sand behind the beach dunes and in the adjoining swamps. This technology will certainly add value for its wider remediation applications.James Stafford: For now, though, MCW's technology seems to be flying under the radar -- where many will not have heard of it.  Gerald Bailey: You know, I recognized this when I joined the company that MCW had a technology that nobody else had. I also recognized that it could make a huge splash on the world oil scene. Now it's ready to reach out to the public. This comes at a time when oil sands extraction is a tense issue in Utah, with protesters attempting to block an oil sands project owned by another company, which is using a water-based technology. Educating the public on the different processes of extracting oil sands will be key to pushing an environmentally-friendly agenda forward.There has been no protest to our Asphalt Ridge project in Utah to date because we emit nothing to the air or soil and there is no water to discard. MCW has worked very closely with the Energy Development Department in Utah, meeting or exceeding all environmental requirements. We're working under the guidelines of their Responsible Resource Development Program, which is proof that resources may be safely developed with placing the environment at risk. Nonetheless, the general public still needs to be made aware of both the environmental and economic possibilities here for the future.James Stafford: What is the long-term goal here? Building plants around the world, or licensing the technology?Gerald Bailey: MCW is prepared to go several routes. We can build a plant for others, or we can build and operate these extraction plants as a joint venture. However, licensing is definitely an excellent way to deploy our technology worldwide. This unique MCW technology has major global applications. You can create an attractive revenue stream for everybody who implements it. Russia, China, Afghanistan, Dominican Republic, Namibia, Jordan and Trinidad -- these are all great potential license purchasers with considerable oils sands deposits.Eventually, we could even potentially clean up Alberta's tailings ponds by de-watering the abandoned sludge and applying our new solvents to squeeze the rest of the oil out.It is actually surprising that nobody discovered this before... it is like the Wright Brothers, they found a way and they proved the process. Someone always comes along to solve the problem. MCW has accomplished this...Our technology works; there is no pollution; nothing toxic goes back into the ground or into the air. We will be driving a lot of cars on the refined gasoline that comes from these huge reserves.

The Solar Ready Vets program brings military skillsets-- discipline, collaboration, technical skills, adaptability, and perseverance-- to meet America's energy needs, while also providing jobs to veterans in one of the fastest growing industries.When you think of solar power advocates, images of Whole Foods-reusable-bags-Birkenstock-wearing liberals may come to mind. But one industry leading our nation in a transition to solar couldn't be farther from that description: the US military. Our men and women in uniform, preparing for deployment with large solar arrays in the background is already the reality for many military bases around the country, and is becoming more and more common. And here's why--solar panels allow our soldiers, airmen, marines, coast guard, and sailors more able to do their jobs: protect our beloved country.For our military, solar panels aren't a symbol of political affiliation. Instead, they're about saving money and creating energy independence. The Department of Defense (DoD), the largest single consumer of energy in the U.S., has committed to producing three gigawatts of renewable energy by 2025, which will equate to roughly one quarter of any DoD facility coming from renewable sources. That's enough to power 2.25 million homes, or the equivalent of replacing six coal power plants.In addition to providing our armed service members clean, cheap, and consistent power, solar is also providing another opportunity for our veterans: jobs. And lots of them--the solar industry is outpacing our economy in job creation tenfold. Within the past year, one out of every 78 new jobs in this country were in solar. The transition from protecting our country to providing it with resilient energy comes naturally to our veterans.In 2014, three bases tested the Solar Ready Vets program, which is a four to six-week training to prepare our veterans to jump into the solar workforce. Hampton Roads Norfolk Naval Base was one of those initial three, and in an exercise of pure collaboration--the first of its kind--between the US Department of Energy Sunshot Initiative, the DoD, and Tidewater Community College, the program has been so successful that it is now implemented in over 10 bases across the country. Mihn Le (pictured below, right), the Director of the Solar Energy and Technologies Office for the US Department of Energy attributes the success of the program to the skills the veterans bring to the field. \"Veterans have a lot of discipline and are trained very well. Approximately 10% of the solar workforce is composed of veterans, whereas only 1% of the population serves in the military.

He was given away to the Daniels family on June 4th, 2007 and his life drastically changed three months later.On the morning of September 7, 2007, in a fit of rage at his mother, Juan Daniels tied Louis to a fence and began beating him with a stick. The stick soon broke so he picked up a shovel and began hitting him with the blade allover. Louis had cuts to the top of his head and nose from the side of the blade.Daniels then doused Louis with lighter fluid and lit him on fire. The fluid ran down the dog's back and puddled on the ground beneath him where it became a pool of flames. Louis was tied so he had no way to escape the flames.His back left leg was completely engulfed and the pain was so intense he tried to bite his leg off. The pads of his feet and toenails were all burned off as well as his ears. His nose, eyes and forehead were badly burned, not to mention his entire underside where the flames were the most intense.Fortunately, Daniels' 13-year-old sister was in the backyard and witnessed the horrific scene. She ran into the house and called 911. The Police and Fire Departments responded to the call and a Humane Officer from the Montgomery Humane Society, Matthew Cooper, was contacted by the 911 operator. He arrived soon after because he happened to be three minutes from the scene.Following the smell of charred flesh, he went to the backyard; the flames were out and Louis remained chained to the fence with his little body still smoking.Officer Cooper took him and rushed to the nearby Golden Animal Hospital. Sitting in the back of the truck, every time Officer Cooper turned to look, Louis would wag his tail. When he was led in the backdoor of the hospital, the first thing Dr. Holladay Simmons and the staff noticed was that even in excruciating pain, his tail was wagging.Louis Vuitton at the veterinary clinic where he was treated after being sprayed with lighter fluid, set on fire and beaten in September 2007.With full-thickness burns over 70 percent of his little body, Dr. Holladay was prepared to euthanize him to relieve him from the pain. She was in tears, composing herself to do what needed to be done. Louis looked into her eyes with hope and determination, and a tail that never stopped wagging.  At that point, she made a promise that she would fight to save him as long as he would fight to survive. That was the day that his previous life and \"Cain\" died, and Louis Vuitton was born.The hunt for Juan Daniels was on. The 20-year-old was on the run and law enforcement officials from all over the State of Alabama were searching for him.The reason Daniels was angry? His mother wouldn't let him use the family car.Within days, U.S. Marshals located him hiding out in Tuscaloosa. He was arrested and brought back to the Montgomery County Jail. It would be 16 months before he decided to plead guilty to Animal Cruelty.On January 30, 2009, Juan Daniels was sentenced to 9-1/2 years in the Alabama Department of Corrections. It was the first case to be sentenced under Alabama's Gucci's Law which carries a maximum of ten years for Animal Cruelty.Louis Vuitton leave a Pardons and Paroles hearing in Montgomery, Ala., Tuesday, Aug. 24, 2010. Credit: Dave Martin / Associated PressUnfortunately, Daniels served only four years before being released in November 2013. Louis' family and supporters were appalled by the early release but there wasn't much they could do.On February 12, 2015, Daniels drove a 2004 GMC Yukon into an apartment building in Montgomery, AL. Daniels was fighting with a man and intentionally drove the SUV into the apartment in an attempt to hit the man. Instead, he hit 6-year-old Aiden Howard. Sadly, Aiden died from his injuries 10 days later.Aiden Howard (Source: Family)Again, Daniels fled. This time the manhunt was for an armed and dangerous murderer. He was finally captured by U.S. Marshals on March 5 in a suburb of Atlanta. He will be charged with capital murder.Everyone questioned why he was released early despite being denied parole in 2010 due to a string of disciplinary problems and \"egregious\" behavior in prison.Studies have shown that those who abuse animals rarely stop there; they will escalate. It is an aggressive and antisocial behavior, a signature pathology of the most serious violent offenders and a reliable predictor of violence against people. Juan Daniels is proof.Unfortunately, he's not the only one. The frequency and ferocity of abuse is not letting up across the country:California: July 4, 2013 -- Indy, a 3-year-old dog was found with third-degree burns to his chest, paws and rear legs. Carlos Efrain Duarte, 41, strapped fireworks to Indy and lighting them before leaving the badly-burned dog in an alley to die. He was charged with one count of animal cruelty as the only clear evidence was of security video footage of Duarte unloading Indy from the bed of his truck. Duarte pled no contest on one count of felony cruelty to an animal and was sentenced to two years in state prison. He was taken into custody on September 30, 2014, but because of overpopulation, served ONLY 3 DAYS.Georgia: May 21, 2015 -- A young female pit bull mix was found dead, hanging on a chain off of a bridge on Kelly Lake Road in Dekalb County, GA. She was discovered by a mother walking her son from a nearby elementary school. Animal cruelty detectives believe it was intentionally thrown over the side of the bridge. A local organization, Stubby's Heroes, spearheaded the campaign to find the killer(s) by raising $10,000 and awareness through news media. Despite the reward, nobody has come forward. Advocates believe the community is afraid of retaliation from the killer(s).South Carolina: May 27, 2015 -- Caitlyn, a 15-month-old dog found with her muzzle taped shut in North Charleston, SC. Police arrested William Leonard Dodson and charged him with ill treatment of animals and torture. At the time of his arrest, Dodson was on probation for a weapons conviction and out of jail on bail on a more recent drug and gun charge. According to court records, the convicted violent felon purchased Caitlyn two days earlier and taped her muzzle because she barked too much. He told the previous owner about it and laughed.Then there are those committed by young offenders. There is the case of the bleached pups by an 8-year-old in Fond Du Lac, WI, because the puppies were biting the boy's foot; or \"Honor\" was caught on video being tossed and body-slammed by laughing teens in St. Louis, or \"Miracle\" who was thrown off the bridge by an 18-year old just outside of Boswell, KY... all of these happened just in the first quarter of 2014.A kid hurting an animal is not a \"phase\" and it's no laughing matter.All the cases above are just a small percentage that are getting nationwide attention because there are advocates and animal lovers who rallied behind these victims. Countless other victims aren't so lucky because they were abused behind walls, in remote locations, or because those who knew did not speak up.You may notice that all the victims above are pit bulls. Although pit bulls are not the only dogs being hurt, according to The Humane Society of United States, they are the most common victims of animal cruelty. And this unfortunate trend is rising at an alarming rate.One thing for sure: this is not a pit bull problem. Even if you don't like pit bulls, you should care because this is a community problem; because the next thing these violent criminals hurt could be your loved ones. Just like Aiden Howard, who was sitting on the couch watching cartoons when Juan Daniels took his life.The next victim could be you."}, {"title": "A Zesty Herbed Salad For People Who Hate Lettuce", "text": "Sometimes, it feels as if there are only so many ways to brighten up a boring salad.

This strong commitment from a Republican leader confirms once again that climate action is a practical solution, in the interest of every state. Cutting carbon pollution will make the air safer to breathe, generate good-paying jobs and help protect our families from destructive climate change.Michigan is seizing an opportunity presented by the Clean Power Plan, which gives every state the freedom to create its own approach to meeting these new carbon pollution limits on power plants. NRDC analysis shows that ambitious state plans are readily achievable. We have mapped out how 12 states -- ranging from Michigan to Montana, Ohio to Florida -- can slash carbon pollution with renewable energy and energy efficiency.Our findings show that states with strong plans will reap the greatest benefits in public health, economic growth and cost savings.Strong clean power plans will also shield residents from the consequences of climate inaction.Climate change is already taking a toll on our communities. This summer alone, mega fires burned homes in Washington State, heavy rains damaged crops in Indiana and heat waves threatened people's health in the Northeast.These hazards will only get even worse if we fail to reduce carbon pollution now. And so will the price. Citibank released a report this week showing that clean energy investments will save the world $1.8 trillion in the next 25 years compared to business-as-usual. Failure to act, meanwhile, will cost an additional $44 trillion from the \"negative effects\" of unchecked climate change.America's leaders will also feel the consequences of inaction. Poll after poll after poll shows the vast majority of Americans support measures that reduce carbon pollution from power plants. In Michigan, 90 percent of businesspeople favor state-based efforts to meet the carbon pollution limits set out in the Clean Power Plan. And American leadership through strong implementation of the Clean Power Plan is a critical part of climate action around the world. People want leaders to tackle the climate threat now, and they will grow weary of those who deny, delay or block forward movement.Fortunately, strong climate action is possible for every state in the nation.NRDC analysis confirms that states can use existing energy resources and build on existing energy policies to slash carbon pollution and unleash benefits.Illinois, for instance, can meet its carbon pollution limit largely by expanding wind and solar power and improving the energy efficiency of its buildings and industry. Complementary state clean energy policies will support this clean energy expansion. The Illinois Clean Jobs Bill would double the state's investment in efficiency and expand the renewable energy target from 25 percent by 2025 to 35 percent by 2030. The bill would also put tens of thousands of people to work across the state and help people save an average of $100 a year on utility costs, according to the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group. Cleaning up power plants will also help save 2,100 lives and prevent 760 hospitalizations in Illinois from 2020 to 2030, according to a Harvard study.Similar benefits await all states that craft ambitious plans under the Clean Power Plan. The best compliance approaches are simple, tested, and low-cost. They have high environmental integrity and are easily interconnected across states and regions.State clean power plans protect from the worst consequences of climate inaction. Climate change doesn't respect political party boundaries. Governor Snyder's commitment for Michigan shows the kind of leadership that helps all of us tackle the climate change challenge together."}, {"title": "GMOs: The Effects of Emerging Technologies", "text": "In my last post, I uncovered some of the places genetically modified organisms are entering our world and permeating our very lifestyles. It is safe to say that the rapid advances of genetic engineering are transforming our daily lives sometimes unseen and mostly untested. What do we really know about their effects on the environment and our health? Some insist that the technology is safe and to stop being anti-science luddites. Others hold to the precautionary principle. Let's take a look at some of the consequences being uncovered by scientists around the globe. Here is what we know:Toxins are on the Rise Agricultural Economist and scientist Chuck Benbrook has spent a good portion of his professional career studying the effects of agriculture, specifically GMO crops. In his 2012 study, \"Impacts of genetically engineered crops on pesticide use in the U.S. -- the first sixteen years,\" he displays that the use of herbicides has increased dramatically since the inception of herbicide-tolerant varieties of corn and soy. This technology has led to a 527 million pound increase in herbicide use in the United States between 1996 and 2011. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) findings are similar. They indicate an increase from 20 million pounds in 1992 to more than 280 million pounds in 2012.The most widely used herbicide by far is glyphosate, more commonly known as Roundup. In March 2015, the World Health Organization classified it as a probable carcinogen in humans. Since a good portion of Monsanto's revenue is manifested from Roundup and the crops that are genetically altered to withstand its application, Monsanto immediately demanded a retraction. They don't seem to care that Dr. Robin Mesnage and co-authors found that glyphosate herbicides may even be toxic, well below regulatory safety limits. This study indicates that endocrine disruption can occur, causing liver and kidney toxicity, neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, and teratogenicity (ability to cause birth defects). Those are all cities best avoided!The USGS repeatedly finds glyphosate herbicides in most Midwestern streams. It's been found in our urine, breast milk and in the organs of animals with birth defects. Because of its rampant use, especially here in the U.S., it is likely you or your family has glyphosate residues in your bodies.Seeds are in DeclineAnother little-known consequence of GMO technology is the effect it's had on our seeds. Call it seed sovereignty or seed security. If people do not have the access and ability to save, breed and replant seeds, they have no real food security. Seed is the very basis of our food. When genetically modified entities are created, they are also patented by the companies that created them. In essence, those companies now own that specific life form. It becomes illegal to save, replant, cross breed or conduct research on those patented seeds and crops.Consolidation in the seed and chemical industry has intensified. According to ETC Group's \"Putting the Cartel Before the Horse\" news release, \"...six multinational firms (Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, Bayer, Dow, and BASF) control 75% of all private sector plant breeding research, 60% of the commercial seed market (100% of the transgenic seed market) and 76% of global agrochemical sales.\"Unknown Consequences Loom\"Traditional\" genetic modification involves inserting the DNA of one species into another. Now they are tinkering with novel and, for the most part, untested, methods, intentionally changing the RNA of an entity to turn off \"undesirable\" traits. No longer do they have to introduce foreign DNA, but by manipulating the RNA it can turn genes off, literally.This technology is what makes the newly deregulated Arctic Apple stay pearly white for 15-18 days after it's been sliced. Scientists used RNA and turned off the genes that naturally make the apple brown. The same technology was used to create Simplot's non-browning potato.Companies are planning to engineer plants with double-stranded RNAs to kill pests when they eat that plant. There are also plans to make sprays that carry RNA into the cells of weeds. In the article, \"Securing the safety of genetic modification,\" the authors conclude, \"We are concerned that what happens to pest insects and nematodes that eat these RNA molecules can also happen to other insects, wildlife and people. The risks of double-stranded RNA have not been systematically evaluated by any regulatory agency we know of, and there are no standard safety testing procedures.\"Another new and controversial genetic technology is a \"genome-editing\" technique called CRISPR. This technique lets researchers alter genetic sequences quickly and flexibly at will. One proposed use of CRISPR is to create 'gene drives' where a researcher creates genetic changes in an organism that is designed to more rapidly and deliberately spread through an entire population. In a few generations, much like a nuclear chain reaction, it is intended that the entire population of the species changes or can be wiped out entirely. The mutation is irreversible, and wild genes just can't compete. To quote an article in the International Business Times, \"...natural selection would be turned on its head and decisions made by some researchers could end up permanently rewriting the genomes of entire wild populations.\"While many of these emerging technologies may hold potential for combating pests, disease and many of the world's woes, we do not have a good enough grasp on how they affect humans and the environment in the long term. It is said that it takes at least a full human generation to understand the implications of a new technology. Existing GMO technology has only been in commercial use since the 90's, which isn't long enough to fully understand its ramifications let alone the long-term effects on evolution. New technologies definitely need more assessment and regulation as they are introduced. The track record so far hasn't been great for transgenic products as is apparent in the rise in toxins and the demise of our seeds.For the sake of our planet and its inhabitants, it's time we stepped back and did some due diligence before we race round the next technological turn."}, {"title": "Kosovo's Battle for Clean Air and Energy", "text": "Last year, $28 billion was collectively spent on climate finance from six large multilateral development banks (MDBs). That's no small feat, but 2,100 new coal plants slated for construction worldwide threaten to push us over our global 2°C carbon budget: 276 gigawatts are currently under construction and another 1,000 gigawatts are in different planning stages. These are numbers that should elicit additional energy investment scrutiny.  The World Bank serves as an ever-important actor at the intersection of development policy and investment, and will continue to play a critical role in executing clean energy strategies in the least resource-rich regions of the world. However, a particular proposal for a 600-megawatt coal-fired plant in Kosovo challenges the World Bank's broader objective to finance low-emissions energy development and may result as one of the \"rare exceptions\" to its pledge to stop funding new coal projects overseas.  A pending decision to fund this coal-fired plant in Kosovo is generating intense debate. The Kosovo C plant in question would be the third lignite coal plant in a country that produces approximately 98 percent of its energy capacity from coal. This is cause for concern. According to a 2012 World Bank report, air pollution in Kosovo causes 835 premature deaths, 310 new cases of chronic bronchitis, 600 hospital admissions and 11,600 emergency visits each year. And while the Kosovo C project has stagnated for over a decade -- accruing millions of dollars in sunk costs -- it is now undergoing its final environmental impact assessment, and the World Bank will likely vote on whether to authorize the project in fall 2015.  Local environmental advocacy groups like Kosovo's Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development (KOSID) and international groups like the Sierra Club are advocating for cleaner, cheaper energy alternatives to the proposed plant. These groups point out that the proposed Kosovo C plant fails to comply with the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan. Moreover, the Sierra Club states in a report that the World Bank's \"expert panel failed to adequately address several areas of non-compliance with the Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change (SFDCC) criteria. Specifically, the Kosovo Power Project does not meet the SFDCC criteria with respect to: development impact; assistance for low-carbon alternatives; assessment of efficiency options; assessment of externalized costs; and potential support for incremental costs.\"  The World Bank's proposed coal-fired power plant also complicates Kosovo's future as a potential member state of the European Union. This is because the country would struggle to meet ever-increasing EU renewable energy standards. At this stage, it is fair to question what it will take for Kosovo and the World Bank to reach an inflection point and consider more economical alternatives to coal.Moving Kosovo Towards a Low Carbon EconomyFor the past four years, the World Bank has eschewed investments in new coal facility generation, which is unequivocally a positive development. However, the proposed brown-coal fired plant uses one of the lowest grades of combustible rock, producing more carbon dioxide emissions and volatile matter than any other grade. In addition, it would be located only six miles from Pristina, Kosovo's most densely populated city. In this light, the Kosovo C Plant threatens to roll back recent gains the World Bank has made in its commitment to financing cleaner energy.  I visited Pristina in 2012, and it was clear then that the public health threats are real. Reckoning with the thick fetor of coal and the feeling of inhaling diluted soot when walking around town was an unfamiliar challenge. At the end of my trip, I had the luxury of being able to leave the city, but for the 198,000 residents who live in Pristina, long-term exposure to particulate matter build up is an everyday reality.  Back in California, a region with the some of strictest air quality requirements, Dr. Daniel Kammen, a UC Berkeley professor and former World Bank clean energy consultant, makes the case for adopting clean energy in Kosovo. In each scenario that his team modeled, they found that coal is more expensive to produce in the region than an amalgamation of renewable energy sources, such as: wind, solar, biomass, hydropower and potentially geothermal energy. \"While the Kosovo story itself is significant, all of the nations in this part of Eastern Europe are dealing with 1950's Soviet era technologies and are seen by some as a region of laggards, but really this could be a region of clean energy leaders,\" said Dr. Kammen, as he addressed an audience of academics and professionals at an event in February. Right now, Kosovo sits astride vast potentials for alternative energy sources; it's just a matter of taking the first step.  Ten years ago, coal was the most affordable resource used to create energy security for Kosovars, which may be why the World Bank first considered the Kosovo C coal plant. Today, Kosovo has access to cost-effective clean energy alternatives that both address energy security and create new vehicles of economic growth in the face of climate change. With the average coal-fired power plant lasting up to 50 years and causing an array of local environmental and human health issues, I hope this isn't the energy legacy the World Bank wants to leave behind in Kosovo."}, {"title": "Latinos to Congress: Save the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Preserve the Antiquities Act!", "text": "Latinos have an intimate connection with nature. Many who emigrated to the U.S. grew up in rural environments, poor in material goods but rich in nature's bounty. Because of this, experiencing and honoring the natural environment -- what Latinos call Madre Tierra, or Mother Earth -- has always been of central significance, a way to collectively express who we are as a people.Latinos who did not farm wound up living in urban centers, surrounded by asphalt, steel and concrete. Where could families and children find respite from city life? Enter the nation's parks, preserves and national monuments. Whether local community parks or national parks like Yellowstone, parks offer Latinos a way to reconnect to something central to our culture and identity. These green spaces are ideal for family gatherings and for facilitating community connections, not unlike the plazas in towns across Latin America. In this way, the nation's parks brings Latinos together.The benefits of our nation's parks are many. Parks employ thousands of individuals, creating a direct economic impact for our communities. They contribute to the beautification and air quality of our cities and towns. And they also provide health benefits. Throughout the United States, Latino children and families are struggling with difficult health issues, including obesity, asthma and diabetes. While there are numerous contributing factors, the lack of access to parks and green spaces throughout Latino neighborhoods is a major obstacle to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Hispanic Federation recently released a report that highlights the benefits of parks, and some of the many examples of successful parks projects.One way Congress can help Latinos solve these issues is by providing permanent support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), set to expire September 2015, and to support the Antiquities Act, both powerful tools that can help Americans preserve their vital public lands. LWCF takes a portion of royalties from energy companies and reinvests them in the conservation of our public lands and natural resources. For over 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected more than 5 million acres of land and supported more than 41,000 state and local park projects. Along with LWCF, the Antiquities Act is another important tool in public land preservation that allows the President and Congress to designate national monuments. Passed by Congress in 1906, it has served as the President's main park-creation authority. Sixteen of nineteen Presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used the Antiquities Act to protect America's best known and loved landscapes, preserving for all time our shared cultural and natural heritage.Sadly, there are those in Congress who oppose funding the LWCF and aim to refuse reauthorization. What's more, while the Land and Water Conservation Fund is authorized to receive up to $900 million per year, Congress nearly always diverts the funds for other uses, leading to inadequate funding for vital conservation projects. This is unacceptable, particularly when we know that parks and green spaces are critically important in the fight against obesity. In Latino communities across the country, monetary support from the LWCF provides spaces for children and their families to walk, hike, run and exercise safely near their homes.Similarly, some in Congress wish to water down the Antiquities Act. They argue that state governments are better suited to preserving and expanding parklands. They also claim there is no public input in Presidential designations of public parks and monuments under the Antiquities Act, and thus want to take away the President's power. In reality, these convenient, false assumptions do nothing to improve access to parks and green spaces for Latino communities.Congress has a chance to fix the LWCF once and for all. Congressmen Raúl Grijalva (D-Arizona) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania) have introduced H.R 1814, a bi-partisan bill to permanently reauthorize the Land Water Conservation Fund. The bill ensures that public lands remain truly accessible to the American people for outdoor recreation by setting aside at least 1.5 percent (a minimum of $10 million) of LWCF funds to increase access to existing federal public lands for hunting, fishing and other recreational purposes. Recently, an unprecedented 75 leading Latino organizations signed a letter to the House of Representatives expressing support for this bill and the LWCF.Congress also must not hinder the President's authority to designate, given recent historical advances in designating Latino heritage sites. Important examples include designation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks as a National Monument in 2014, the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument, established in 2012 to honor Chavez and his critically important work in securing fair wages and working conditions for farm workers and many others, and the Río Grande del Norte National Monument, established in 2013 to preserve a varied and stunning recreational landscape as well as significant prehistoric and historic resources.The 114th Congress must act by September to permanently reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congressmen Grijalva and Fitzpatrick know that the LWCF works and is essential to the health and vitality of communities across America. Now is the time for colleagues in Congress to follow their lead and save this vital program.José Calderón is President of the Hispanic Federation, the nation's premier Latino non-profit membership organization"}, {"title": "Lebanese Protesters Occupy Environment Ministry Over Trash Crisis", "text": "BEIRUT, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Dozens of Lebanese protesters staged a sit-in inside the environment ministry in the capital Beirut on Tuesday, calling on minister Mohammad Machnouk to resign, a Reuters witness said.Lebanon has been hit by a series of protests against the government ignited by a dispute over uncollected rubbish in the country.A Reuters witness said that soldiers watched protesters who staged a sit-in along a corridor inside the top floor of the ministry.

If we want to change our trajectory and solve a problem as complex as this, breakthrough innovation - in technology, business, governance, finance, and civil society - is essential.Most elements of this ecosystem have developed a systematic approach to innovation. Be it private sector institutions like Google's ATAP, venture capital accelerators like y combinator, or famed government institutions like Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), successful examples of accelerating innovation abound. Indeed, the smartest people are focused not just on winning the game, but on changing the way it's played all together.And yet despite our growing political power an entire set of institutions is notably absent - foundations and civil society. Outside exciting institutions like Citizens Engagement Lab, very few examples of programs explicitly focused on innovating new breakthrough strategies (in contrast with technologies or business) exist. There is no doubt that in their absence, civil society remains innovative finding new and clever ways to strategically build power to overcome the immense power of entrenched incumbents. But despite our many victories (and there are many) we're simply not winning fast enough.Just as any financial advisor worth their salt would require their clients to maintain a diversified portfolio we too need a few high-risk, high-reward 'venture' returns. Investments in disruptive opportunities that break through the status quo. The advocates version of billion dollar valuations, our 'unicorn' strategies.So other than throw our hands up in despair at our plain vanilla bonds what do we do? Steal a page from the playbook of those who innovate for a living that's what. Because it turns out the secret sauce of leaders like DARPA is deceptively simple and for those who master it highly impactful. Here's a taste of the four key elements that create unicorns:A focus on individual talent given a short intensive period of focus to achieve a breakthrough. Successfully innovative institutions almost always fixate on identifying and recruiting outstanding individuals (referred to as \"Program Managers\" or PMs) that have expertise in specific areas where the institution is looking for breakthrough advances. Most importantly the PMs once recruited interact intensively with other PMs and with experts, including an intense vetting of their proposed plans within the organization. But once approved they are given significant leeway to be the entrepreneurs they are and succeed - or fail trying.A focus on right-left thinking and 'white spaces.' To avoid the trap of thinking only of the next marginal gain, those that care about innovation care about 'breakthroughs' (the right side of the plan). With that in mind they then work back to the left side to see what steps are needed to advance toward the breakthrough. There is often also a top-down search involved: the institutions continually are looking for \"white space\" areas where breakthroughs could be transformative but where there is not yet focused research (e.g., invisible planes...).The creation of a community of talent interacting in a crucible of innovation. Individuals in these programs issue request for proposals (RFPs) to fund a set of researchers in their area and sometimes also launch prize competitions (e.g., the robot challenge, the self-driving vehicle challenge, etc.). They then bring the researchers together repeatedly over their tenure to create a highly interactive group both collaborating and competing under time pressure to solve the problem.Scale, Scale Scale. The institutions recognize that some breakthroughs may take more than the tenure of one PM so some areas of work can continue beyond the term of a PM. In general, though, they seek to quickly link the emerging technologies to a source of demand. DARPA has a built in avenue to scale in the immense budget of the Defense Department.

The success to innovation revealed. As I said, deceptively simple yet elusive.

Their finding - that global warming increased the drought's severity by 8 - 27% - deepens our understanding of just how damaging and costly even small amounts of global temperature increase can be. This year alone, the California drought has cost the State 2.7 billion dollars, and led to the loss of 21,000 jobs. Beyond that, it has caused tremendous hardship and personal strain for thousands of people, particularly in the agriculture sector.It surprised me to see just how strongly global warming is already playing it's hand because until now I've tended to think about climate change in terms of large scale, future impacts. But my gaze has suddenly been brought to the very present, and the fact that a small amount of warming is already carrying massive costs.Earlier this year we crossed a milestone of sorts that nobody celebrated and few people recognised: we clocked up more than 1 degree of warming since the mid 1800s. That puts us halfway at least toward the two degree warming limit countries have committed to through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But keeping within the two degrees limit is unlikely at this point, and according to current policies in place the world is on a path to between 3.6 to 4.2°C warming by 2100. Even 2 degrees will bring significant costs to pay, and the burden all too often will fall on those that have done the very least to cause this problem.That burden is currently unfolding across the Pacific Ocean, as Papua New Guinea plunges deeper into a severe drought. Over 2 million people are facing severe food and water shortages, schools have closed due to water shortages, and according to the Post Courier in Papua New Guinea, many people are being urged to cut back to just one meal a day (see photo). Just have a look at these photos to get a sense of how desperate the situation is turning.While the drought is being fuelled by a growing El Niño and has been coupled with harsh frosts, global warming is playing its hand in making this drought more severe. No one has yet calculated exactly what percentage of severity global warming is adding right now in Papua New Guinea, but we know for sure that it is playing its hand forcefully. There's a number of ways that global warming affects droughts, but at its most basic, as Park Williams at Columbia University explains:Each year, the heat squeezes more moisture from soils and ecosystems. This is because, as the atmosphere warms, its demand for moisture rises. Just as a puddle evaporates more quickly on a warm day, soils dry out more quickly during warmer years, which are becoming increasingly frequent in most locations globally.The future for Papua New Guinea is unlikely to get any easier either, where according to the Asian Development Bank, climate change is forecast to wipe 4% of PNG's GDP every year by 2050, growing rapidly to 16% of GDP by 2100 - and that's under a moderate warming scenario. That's a harsh future to face for a country that ranks 171st for greenhouse gasses per capita, and has done so very little to cause this damage.It's imperative that the global community responds rapidly and in partnership with the Government in Papua New Guinea to minimise the impact of the drought, and there's important lessons that have been learnt from the devastating drought of 1997. And more widely, as the severity and scale of extreme weather events ratchets up in coming years we are going to have to find new ways of scaling up the global response to climate damage. One thing is clear is that there are companies to be held accountable. The Carbon Majors report establishes that \"63 percent of carbon emissions in the atmosphere have come from the coal, oil, and gas extracted and cement manufactured by only 90 entities - the \"Carbon Majors\", which include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom, and Shell.\"The authors of that report, the Climate Justice Programme, are proposing a levy at the point of all fossil fuel extraction, as a means to gather the billions of dollars needed to compensate for the climate damage being experienced by vulnerable nations. Stephen Leonard of the Climate Justice Programme explains how the levy would work:Instead of being passed onto consumers, the costs associated with the levy should be absorbed by the dirty energy giants that have long made extraordinary profits. The money raised should be held in an international fund specifically for the provision of financial support--for responding to an extreme weather event that has caused extensive destruction, for example, or assisting with the relocation of a coastal community subjected to rising seas. Even a minimal levy, of around $5 per ton of extracted carbon, could generate more than $50 billion per year to assist hard-hit developing countries.As our emerging experiences of living with 1 degree of warming demonstrate, finding new sources of relief and support for resilience building is critical. Hand in hand with redress, the experiences should be a rallying call for people to join the global movement that is perhaps at last building critical momentum. It is at least the best way to remain hopeful in the face of such disruption."}, {"title": "In Alaska, Obama Highlights Climate Change While His Decisions Draw Accusations Of 'Hypocrisy'", "text": "WASHINGTON -- As President Barack Obama visits Alaska this week, he is facing criticism and outright outrage from environmental advocates who say his focus on climate change while in the region contradicts his administration's decision to allow Shell to drill there.The administration granted Shell permission to begin exploratory oil and gas drilling in the Chukchi Sea this summer. And Obama plans to put a major emphasis on climate change during his visit to Alaska, the frontline of climate change's effects in the United States.

It’s the frontier of global climate change, so it's an appropriate place for the president to make a speech about climate,\" said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow on foreign policy, energy security and climate at the Brookings Institution. \"But he is caught in this quandary because his environmental constituency is adamantly opposed to drilling.\"Ebinger notes that Shell's leases for the region predate Obama's tenure -- they were auctioned in 2008, under George W. Bush's Department of Interior -- and Shell has already invested a reported $7 billion in operations there. The Obama administration seems to have decided, he said, \"that they should let Shell at least progress with this activity.\" But, he added, it does not appear that the administration \"will welcome someone else following behind Shell, necessarily.\"For one, it's not clear exactly how much oil is even up there, let alone how much can be easily accessed. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated in 2008 that there are 90 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil in the entire Arctic Region, and 84 percent of that is offshore. That's enough to provide about three years of oil for the world, according to consumption estimates from the International Energy Agency. The oil in offshore Alaska is only estimated at around 26.6 billion barrels -- or less than a year's supply for the world.Shell clearly believes there's plenty of oil there to have invested so heavily in exploration, but isn't expected to begin production for at least a decade.Hannah McKinnon, a senior campaigner with the group Oil Change International, argues that the administration's decision to allow drilling fits within its \"all-of-the-above\" energy strategy. \"I think the big part of the problems is that a lot of their energy policy and their climate policy simply aren't aligned,\" said McKinnon. The Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration projects relatively stable demand for oil for the next 25 years, while the administration has taken a number of actions intended to drive down demand, like raising fuel economy standards for automobiles. Those projections, said McKinnon, \"assume climate policies are going to fail.\"If demand did remain that high, said McKinnon, \"we're talking about a future of climate catastrophe.\""}, {"title": "Do Dogs Feel 'Guilty' Like We Do? Here's What The Science Says", "text": "Plenty of dog owners have seen their pets make a \"guilty face\" after doing something wrong. You know the look -- the lowered ears, the ducked head, the droopy eyes. But can dogs actually feel shame?Maybe not, according to an article that appeared last week in the U.K. newspaper The Telegraph. Researchers told the paper that when a dog appears to be acting contrite, it may just be responding to the angry or dominant body language of its owner.\"I had a client who had three dogs and whenever something happened like a shoe was chewed, it was always one of them that had the guilty look,\" Dr. Ljerka Ostojic, a comparative psychologist at Cambridge University in England, told The Telegraph. \"Yet often she was not the dog who had done it. She was just the most timid dog, and got frightened more quickly by her owner's reaction.\"Ostojic is the lead author of a study published in February in the journal Behavioural Processes, in which researchers found no support for the idea that dogs display the \"guilty look\" when they're not actually being scolded.\"We cannot know for sure because we cannot ask them,\" Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a professor of veterinary medicine at Texas A&M University, told The Huffington Post in an email.But, she said, \"the body language we are really looking at... is simply a submissive response to the body language the higher ranking person is using. We are towering over them, showing direct eye contact, using an accusatory tone of voice.\"A 2009 study showed that domestic dogs tended to look the most \"guilty\" when they were being scolded by their owners -- even if they hadn't done anything wrong.While it's not clear whether dogs feel the complex social emotions of shame and guilt, dogs do develop basic emotions like excitement, distress, contentment, disgust, fear, anger, joy, suspicion and love, according to Modern Dog magazine. (Watch \"Inside Out\" if you don't believe us.)However, as cognitive ethologist Dr. Marc Bekoff noted in a 2014 op-ed for Live Science, dogs have the same neural bases for emotions as other mammals that do experience complex social emotions like guilt. This suggests that it's at least possible that dogs can feel guilt, too -- just maybe not for chewing up your favorite pair of shoes.\"Since animals 'live in the moment' and do what seems appropriate to them at the time, it is doubtful they know the feeling of guilt as we do,\" Beaver told HuffPost. \"It is also extremely difficult to find the answers in non-verbal species.\"How did dogs become man's best friend in the first place?

Members of the North Korean embassy watched as official Fairouz Moussa gave a speech praising their nation's support for the Syrian government, according to state media agency SANA.Syrian President Bashar Assad's embattled regime doesn't have many international allies, as nations and rights groups routinely condemn its horrific attacks on civilians and its human rights abuses. The government also lacks control over a majority of its territory, as various rebels and militant groups like the Islamic State carve up the country. But the Syrian regime is not without its sympathizers, among which is fellow pariah state North Korea.The two brutally repressive countries have a history of friendly ties. Kim praised Assad via North Korean state media last year, in addition to sending the DPRK's foreign minister Ri Su Yong to Damascus to discuss increased cooperation.

There are few things that make me happier than talking to people about their dogs but I will admit, I am particularly enthusiastic when meeting people who have adopted large dogs from a shelter. I think it is because I have always rooted for the underdog and find a kinship with people who feel the same way.State Farm Agent Lindsay Mullen in Atlanta, GA adopted her pit bull Toby from Fulton County Animal Services. Toby was found tied up with a chain in a backyard before being adopted by Lindsay and her family.I work for an insurance company and as a result, I frequently talk to people who own or have adopted a dog and had problems getting homeowners or renters insurance because of the breed of dog they own. Many of them share stories like that of Chris and Zach Olson. Since June they have been fostering a dog named Venus through Ruff Start Rescue in Minnesota. Venus is the quintessential underdog because she is a pit bull with health problems who arrived at the rescue. That didn't matter to Chris and Zach and they applied to adopt Venus just over a week after they began fostering her. When Chris called her homeowners insurance carrier to share the good news, the response was not unusual.Venus with her Ruff Start Rescue foster family, Chris and Zach Olson in Princeton, MN\"My insurance company said they couldn't provide coverage because I had a pit bull.\" said Olson. \"I panicked, I was on the verge of tears because my husband and I had already fallen in love with Venus. She is a good dog who hadn't done anything wrong so why was she already being treated like a bad dog?\"Dogs are a product of their environment. Just like people, every dog has an individual personality and temperament formed by their unique history and experiences. A dog's breed isn't a consistent indicator of how a dog is going to behave just as the physical appearance of a dog is not an indicator for how they are going to interact with people.As dog owners, we are responsible for the health and safety of our pets. We need to make every effort to set up our dogs for success by avoiding situations where they feel the need to protect themselves. Unfortunately not every dog owner acts in a safe and responsible manner and as a result, people can be injured. It doesn't matter if it is a poodle or a pit bull, any breed of dog can bite or cause injury, and any breed of dog can make a great family pet.I mentioned that I work for an insurance company; at State Farm, risk is determined by the dog's bite history rather than breed.

It just takes a responsible owner and a loving home to transform that underdog into a wonder dog. In fact, Venus is well on her way to being a positive force in her community. Venus recently underwent reconstructive surgery on her left leg and is waiting for surgery on her right leg at this time. Once Venus is healthy, she can be officially adopted but Chris already sees the potential for Venus. \"I have plans to get Venus through the courses to become a therapy dog after she finishes her surgeries and then bring her to presentations that Ruff Start Rescue Kid's Education Committee has.\" And don't worry.

Water restrictions are being imposed. Agriculture is being significantly affected, which will result in rising prices across the United States for vegetables, fruits, nuts, and so forth. The Sierra snowpack is minimal or nonexistent in some places, so the spring snowmelt will not result in the drought-ending refilling of reservoirs, which are at about 30 percent of capacity.When will the drought end? No one knows -- but there is no evidence that it will end soon. Some experts are saying that this drought condition is the \"new normal\" for California. This might also be true for Oregon and Washington, which this year are experiencing drought conditions.As California, Oregon, and Washington experience water shortages, Texas and other states have been awash in water this spring: severe floods have caused billions of dollars in damage, lost revenue for farmers, thousands of homes demolished or severely damaged, cars trapped in deep water, schools closed, top-soil being washed away, and so on. (Note: In one month in 2015 the amount of rain that fell in Texas would cover all of the state of Rhode Island in 10 feet of water.)Summary: California is one of the largest states -- and in dire need of water. Texas is one of the largest states -- and large areas of it are overwhelmed with water not being put to good use.Light bulb: What if the water from Texas and other water-laden states could be transported to California and other drought states? Right now the flood-waters are not put to good use. What if the United Stated Congress and the White House determined that a National Water Grid was necessary to secure an adequate food supply at reasonable prices for decades to come and to avoid severe damage to cities, farms, and homes? We would have a visionary solution to what is otherwise a terrible and ongoing waste of water.It's easy to quickly think of the many reasons that a massive water-transport system would not work and would be very expensive. A water grid differs significantly from an electric grid: electricity moves at high speeds through wires, while water is heavy and would require large pipes, large catch basins and reservoirs, and perhaps some canals. Do you go around mountains or drill through them to keep the water relatively level? Do you employ large and powerful pumps or a system of locks when it is necessary to move the water uphill? And how about the headache of securing huge amounts of above-ground and underground rights of way?Before we give up without thinking, let's recall a few humongous projects from which the United States has reaped enormous benefits...for many decades. Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. The Transcontinental Railroad. The national highway system. The Panama Canal. NASA's space program that put humans in orbit around Earth, placed them on the moon, and allowed humans to live in space stations for months at a time.Each of these is an amazing example of how human ingenuity, applied science and technology, grit and gumption, and a national vision combined to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Imagine if our nation could channel enormous volumes of water to the locations that desperately need it...and in the process limit the amount of damage that floodwaters wreak as well as ensure that agriculture would continue to flourish.It would be a win-win for the nation. It would be a win-win for the states suffering from drought and for the states suffering from floods. It would be a win-win for all of us who buy vegetables, fruits, and nuts. It would be a win-win for all the homes and businesses that would not be destroyed.Will this be costly? Of course. (But not as costly as decades of drought and flooding.) Will there be unintended consequences? Of course. (That's always the case with ambitious projects.) Will there be technological challenges and glitches? Of course. (We learn from our mistakes...and move forward nonetheless.) Will there be intelligent nay-sayers who make strong counter-arguments? Of course. (When has that not been the case?)Why not desalinization of Pacific Ocean water? For a number of reasons. It is very costly. Desalinization requires enormous amounts of energy (which is costly and often polluting). If private companies build the desalinization plants, there is a private-public conflict over who controls the desalinization effort and prevents abuses of desalinized water. The intake of ocean water to cool down the operation desalinization plants will kill billions of fish annually. Ergo, desalinization is an option of last resort - and best-suited for nations where there is no excess water being wasted (say, in a nation that is primarily desert).The bottom line is: We, as a nation, can no longer afford to do nothing major about catastrophic flooding or severe droughts that cause millions and billions of dollars of damage each year. We, as a nation, can no longer afford to allow potentially useful water to be wasted in floods. It's time that we stopped sitting on our fatalistic duffs and adopted a can-do attitude.

The board will not reveal what, if any, punishment she will face until October, but it has the power to revoke her license.Lindsey posted a gruesome photo on Facebook in April showing her holding up a cat impaled with an arrow. She quickly removed the photo, but not before it spread across the Internet.Lindsey can be seen grinning in the picture, as she lifts the cat, named Tiger, like a trophy.“My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through its head! Vet of the year award … gladly accepted,” the text reads.Warning: The photo Lindsey posted is graphic.Lindsey was fired in April from the Washington Animal Clinic in Brenham, Texas, soon after the Facebook post went public.Alley Cat Allies, a nonprofit animal rights group, is just one of many organizations that has called for more action to be taken against Lindsey.\"While we are happy that a violation was found, we won't know until October the severity of the punishment. Our hope is that her license is revoked,\" Liz Holtz, an attorney with Alley Cat Allies, told The Huffington Post.\"While this process is far from over, it is the first step in finding retribution for the senseless killing of Tiger,\" said Zandra Anderson, a lawyer specializing in animal law, who represents a group called Tiger's Justice Team. Anderson and her clients are \"elated that the first rung in that process went well.\"Tiger is remembered by those who knew him as a friendly cat, who liked riding around on his pet sitter Amy Hemsell's tractor.“He loved everyone he met,” Hemsell told HuffPost in June. “He was my protector on the farm when I had pet sitting jobs there. He never left my side.”Lindsey escaped criminal charges for killing Tiger after a grand jury found there was \"insufficient proof\" of wrongdoing.Prosecutors lacked \"proof that this incident even occurred in the state of Texas,\" according to a press release from the Austin County Criminal District Attorney’s office. And even if it had, it was unclear to prosecutors if Tiger had been \"killed in a cruel manner\" under the American Veterinary Medical Association's euthanasia guidelines.The AVMA and other veterinary groups -- as well as Lindsey's alma mater, Colorado State University -- disputed this position.Here's an excerpt from a blog post the AVMA published on its website shortly after the decision not to prosecute:We were surprised by the District Attorney’s reference to the AVMA and our Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition in conveying the June  “no bill” decision of the Austin County grand jury in the Kristen Lindsey case. The AVMA was neither consulted nor asked to provide information regarding the case, and we were not aware that the Guidelines would be presented in this way. Based on the statements in the press release, the District Attorney’s application of the Euthanasia Guidelines was seriously flawed.Anderson said the AVMA and others that have weighed in on this case may finally be vindicated, should the board revoke Lindsey's license.\"That to me would be a very good result,\" she said.Also in HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Alaska-Bound: President Obama Visits Our Nation's Climate Change Frontier, Where Wildlife Face Serious Threats", "text": "President Obama flew to Alaska today and will be the first sitting president to visit an Arctic Alaskan community. Why? Because Alaska and the Arctic are on the front lines of the single greatest challenge our planet faces: climate change.As the president points out in his video announcing his trip, climate change isn't just affecting Alaska. It's contributing to extreme drought in California and the Northwest, intensifying storms, like the three major hurricanes currently moving across the the Pacific Ocean, and melting glaciers across the Arctic. But Alaska is facing unique challenges this year: wildfires are raging across the state, and a shocking 30 humpback and fin whales have died recently in the Gulf of Alaska. Both disasters are likely tied to climate change: unusually warm temperatures and lack of rain have made it all too easy for fires to rage out of control, and a large mass of warm water in the North Pacific dubbed the \"warm blob\" has made conditions perfect for toxic algal blooms, a leading suspect in the deaths of the whales. As climate change continues to change the world around us, events like these could become more common.President Obama will meet with people and visit communities experiencing climate change firsthand and talk about its impacts, as well as attend and open the Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic: Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement and Resilience (GLACIER). I hope to see President Obama address the following issues threatening Alaska and arctic wildlife.Climate change resilience and protecting wildlife habitat. As our planet's climate systems dramatically change, we need to protect and preserve wildlife habitat that supports our native species-by land and by sea. We hope President Obama will reiterate his support for designating the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, protecting it from oil drilling forever. But drilling isn't the only threat that arctic animals face.Unprecedented sea ice melt has increased ship traffic in the Bering Strait by an incredible 118% between 2008 and 2012, and the numbers continue to climb. But current international regulations aren't strict enough to prevent non-ice class ships from setting sail in Arctic waters. This could spell tragedy for people and wildlife alike if a spill occurs from a ship sinking or running aground. The president needs to push for stronger controls to ensure that ships that sail in the Arctic Ocean are equipped and prepared for the conditions.A strong oil spill response for marine mammals. It is tragically ironic that President Obama is allowing Shell to move forward with oil drilling when the Arctic is already being impacted by climate change. Pacific walrus, polar bears, whales and ice-dependent seal species all call the Arctic home and depend on its winter sea ice for habitat--habitat that's quickly melting away. With more and more ships traversing the Bering Strait and Shell's plans to re-attempt oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean, the risk of an oil spill is increasing every year.Defenders is doing what we can to mitigate this risk: we've co-funded specially designed large mammal spill response equipment, such as polar bear holding cages and washing tables, and recently hosted a Pacific walrus oil response workshop with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help them revise their response plan for Pacific walrus. But we need more of this equipment staged in high-risk areas, as well as additional ice-breaking ships dedicated to oil spill response. Agencies that would respond to a spill, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Coast Guard, need to work with local communities on developing a strong early response if we are to make a real difference when and if an oil spill happens.The impacts of climate change on wildlife and people. Nowhere else is this more apparent than in Alaska, where many communities depend on native wildlife for subsistence and are exposed to extreme weather year-round.Many Alaska Native communities built on permafrost are fighting to prevent damage as melting of the permafrost causes the ground to sink beneath their homes. Thawing permafrost also releases methane frozen beneath it underground, and contributes to greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which will only continue as thawing frees up more and more trapped gas. Increased evaporation has also caused a decline in Alaska's lakes and wetlands, which provide food and habitat for millions of waterfowl and shorebirds. Our warming climate has caused shrubs to encroach onto Arctic tundra, replacing lichens, a critical food source for caribou, which in turn are an important source of food in Alaska for wolves, bears and people. And every year, polar bears and Alaska Native communities face a smaller window of time during which they can hunt seals and walrus on Alaska's winter sea ice.Wildlife and habitat management in Alaska that takes into account the threat of climate change can help lessen the effect of these impacts. But our nation also needs to be a leader in the fight against climate change. Congress should support President Obama's Clean Power Plan which establishes the first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants; a crucial step in reducing emissions in the United States and around the world.Alaska is truly a climate change frontier. This is President Obama' chance to take a significant leadership role during this international conference and address the myriad threats that face this unique landscape. Wildlife and people in Alaska, the Arctic and across our nation need swift action now."}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders Wants A Debate Just About The Environment", "text": "While Sen.

Energy is money -- the less you waste, the more you save. In most cases, energy production means producing harmful byproducts, like the carbon pollution fueling climate change. In fact, the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States comes from energy generation needed to power our homes and appliances.The good news is, cutting energy waste is good for our pocketbooks and the planet. Homeowners can save money and help fight climate change just by purchasing and living in more energy-efficient homes.Over the past 20 years, ENERGY STAR's Homes program has helped American homeowners save more than $4.7 billion and reduce carbon pollution by over 53 billion pounds. Those savings could power more than two million homes a year.The blue ENERGY STAR label that identifies thousands of energy-efficient products -- like light bulbs and appliances -- also gives homebuyers an easy way to identify better built, more comfortable, energy-efficient homes. ENERGY STAR certified homes are up to 30 percent more efficient than a standard new home, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3,700 pounds each year (compared to a home that is not ENERGY STAR certified). That's equivalent carbon pollution from burning 189 gallons of gasoline.ENERGY STAR homes are designed for energy efficiency from the ground up, following a rigorous certification process that verifies each energy efficiency feature, many of which are hidden behind walls, in the attic, and under the foundation. These features include:By choosing an ENERGY STAR certified home, Americans can save on their energy bills, reduce their impact on our environment and our climate, and help us preserve a healthier future for our children and generations to come.If you're looking for a new home, a list of ENERGY STAR builders is available at energystar.gov/partnerlocator.

Obviously we depend on that for our business, and we all depend on that for the food we eat.\"A spokeswoman for the company, whose brands range from Yoplait yogurt and Pillsbury to Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Green Giant vegetables, went further, telling The Huffington Post that a failure to address climate change would make it extremely difficult to feed the world’s growing population, which is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050.She pointed to extreme weather and the decline in pollinating insects as worrying signs that are already impacting food production, and she noted that climate change will place stress on vulnerable growing regions around the world that provide important ingredients to make food. For example: 70 percent of the world’s cocoa is sourced from two countries in West Africa; 90 percent of the world’s vanilla is sourced from Madagascar; and 80 percent of the world’s almonds are grown in California.In what many will see as a sideways swipe at climate deniers within Congress, Powell made it clear that governments need to join forces with business and citizens to drive change.“While our success depends on our actions, we cannot get there on our own,\" he said in a statement. \"We believe every company, government and individual has a role to play. Climate change is a shared, global challenge that is best addressed at scale.”General Mills, which will invest more than $100 million in energy efficiency and clean energy within its own facilities worldwide, last year became a member of Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), a leading advocacy coalition of businesses committed to working with policymakers to pass climate and energy legislation. It also joined competitors such as Unilever and Nestlé, by signing BICEP’s Climate Declaration, which states, “We cannot risk our kids’ futures on the false hope that the vast majority of scientists are wrong.”General Mills, which has nearly $19 billion in annual sales, is one of a small but growing number of businesses that are now starting to model their sustainability targets using a science-based methodology to achieve emission reductions that are, as General Mills puts it, “necessary to sustain the health of the planet.\"It is has therefore made a commitment in principle to reduce its absolute emissions by between 50 - 74 percent within the next 35 years, in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The company is not alone in warning about risks to the agricultural sector from rising global temperatures.Only last year, Walmart’s U.K. supermarket chain, Asda, published a report by consultants PwC which showed that 95 percent of its entire fresh produce range is already at risk from climate change. The study was the first attempt by a food retailer to put hard figures against the impacts global warming will have on the food it buys from across the world.General Mills claims it is leading its competitors in targeting its entire value chain rather than just focusing on its own direct operations, which account for less than a 10th of the overall impacts. It is teaming up with suppliers to encourage more sustainable agricultural practices, including sourcing products from an additional 250,000 acres of organic production globally within five years.“We know our greatest impact is outside our four walls – particularly in agriculture, ingredients and packaging,\" Powell said. \"To reduce emission levels, we must work across our value chain with growers, suppliers, customers and industry partners. Together, we will identify new solutions and promote sustainable agriculture practices that drive emission reductions.”He gave the example of creating better dietary and manure management practices in the dairy industry, given that cows emit huge amounts of methane, which is over 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.However, the international NGO Oxfam, which ranks the 10 biggest food and drinks companies on their policies and commitments to improve sustainability and food security, earlier this year ranked General Mills as second from bottom. It scored only 31 percent, compared with Unilever at 71 percent and Nestle at 69 percent."}, {"title": "Chemical-Soaked Photographs Explore The Wild Realities Of Polluted Places", "text": "According to his online biography, artist Brandon Seidler grew up in a part of New Jersey \"where the ocean and the mountains met,\" a place that taught him to see the beauty in imperfections. These days, those early imperfections take center stage in Seidler's career as a photographer. His hallucinatory series, \"Impure,\" features landscapes that appear to be ripped straight from a vintage science-fiction film, with colors and shapes blending in ways both creepily familiar and altogether alien.But sci-fi they are not. Seidler captures real places, mostly lands in and around New Jersey and the Hudson River, that have been historically contaminated by various chemical pollutants. He then takes his photographic negatives and soaks them in the very same chemicals found to be befouling the bodies of water and land he's documenting. The results attempt to reveal the tainted realities of America's natural havens.\"I started this project my senior year at Ramapo College of New Jersey,\" Seidler explained to The Huffington Post. \"Originally I was just taking pictures and finding ways to alter the camera or film with chemicals. After a few critiques I decided that I needed to add something to my images to help give them meaning, and that’s when I decided to research chemical spills in the area and pair those chemicals with the film negatives.\"Even prior to college, Seidler had become interested in chemistry and the various environmental issues plaguing his home state, inspired by his marine biologist sister and chemical engineer grandfather. \"Impure\" proved to be a good way to blend these interests with art, allowing the photographer to embark upon an impassioned process of trial and error. After snapping photos of mountains and oceans, using at first disposable cameras and then a Nikon F100, he would introduce chemicals from those sites into his negatives in a variety of ways -- mixing, spraying, submerging, painting -- never really knowing how they would interact.\"At first I would submerge the negatives into the chemicals,\" he elaborated. \"I later tried spraying chemicals onto the negatives, painting the chemicals on, and mixing the chemicals with the film in a sealed container so that the chemicals become bubbly and frothy.\" Aesthetically, he was looking for asymmetry, unique pairings and loud colors.\"I find that the images I gravitate towards the most are loud and vibrant,\" he added. \"I like colors that grab your eye and stand out from the environment. I like how unpredictable the end results look, and love when lots of contrasting colors are left on the negatives creating some fun combinations. I also love the images that stand out with broken symmetry ... For me, it’s all about mismatched sides and unpredictable images so that every part of the image is new and unexpected.\"But in a broader sense, beyond the visuals, he hoped those viewing his images would ask themselves: \"If these are the effects the chemicals have on film, what are the effects it will have on nature?\"According to EPA research from 2014, there were 1,770 instances where contaminants had tainted waters across the state of New Jersey, with PCBs, arsenic, phosphorus and low dissolved oxygen ranking among the most common pollutants. And while we might not always be able to physically assess the damage that manmade toxins are wreaking on our shores -- save for the dark contamination of a massive oil spill -- Seidler's photos help us visualize the ways events like fertilizer runoff and chemical spillage are infiltrating natural spaces. Slowly and gradually, but ever impactful.Seidler has been using social media to gauge the impact of his own photographs, eventually turning to Kickstarter with hopes of turning his most \"liked\" images into a book chock full of research and art. \"I also have another project in mind,\" he told us, \"where I would like to move from landscapes to portraits, and interview subjects to find out what kinds of products they use on a daily basis. I think it would be fun to explore the chemicals we put on our bodies on a daily basis.\"For more on Seidler's work, head over to his Facebook and Instagram accounts, or check out a preview of \"Impure\" below.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "7 Easy Ways to Appease Your Environmentalist Friends", "text": "Do you ever feel like your environmentalist friends are judging you for not being as \"eco\" as them?

The impacts on our weather, food and water supplies, oceans, forests, public health, national security and economy are already being felt. Bees and other species are disappearing. These trends do not bode well for humans.Those facts are not news, or at least not new, but President Obama has made news by making August a Green Letter month taking his newly urgent warnings about our climate crisis on the road. Last stop, Ground Zero, Arctic Alaska where icebergs are melting at a new glacial speed. He will be the first sitting President to bear witness to \"the challenge of our time.\" Hats off to him and it just might be warm enough.Perhaps after this record breaking hot summer we will set a new normal for climate change coverage as well. To date, we have not seen a majority of serious environmental developments covered regularly and with sufficient context and depth on the evening news or on any recurring talk shows. It's time for the news networks to step up their game.For too long we have had what I call a \"Glaring Green Gap.\" Our eco-systems are in decline -- nearly across the board -- and our addiction to fossil fuels is our culture's dirty not-so-little secret. Outside green circles it has not been part of our national conversation nor a regular part of the media mix. Too few Americans are aware that we are in the midst of a sixth mass extinction, the first caused by humans, and that our seas are under siege due to warming waters, overfishing, \"dead zones\" and plastic pollution.While newspapers are doing a better job of going deeper into these issues people are often surprised to learn there are precisely zero talk shows on commercial broadcast stations dedicated to covering our changing environment and discussing what we can do about it. I cannot think of a better use of mass media outlets during this time of crisis especially with timing so critical.After creating, producing and hosting three popular Green programs: \"Trash Talk\" on KCBS Radio in San Francisco, \"Eco Talk\" on Air America -- a daily talk show with 50,000 listeners per night back in 2006 -- and \"Green Front\" airing on the internet, I learned there's a growing audience hungry for this new program genre. Nearly a decade later the multitude of challenges and solutions have expanded exponentially and yet mainstream media has not yet filled the green gap with dedicated content.A big part of the problem is network gatekeepers, both at the programming and executive levels. They are trained to go with the tried and true which often means playing to the lowest common denominator. Just look at the plethora of so-called reality shows while we ignore eco-realities and our future hangs in the balance!Additionally, program managers I've communicated with over the years assume such content would be \"too controversial or too political.\" However, with fossil-fuel interests leading, and funding, \"the deny-o-sphere,\" isn't it time to stop emphasizing the special interest fear-based aspects and wake up to the practical realities of these shared threats?In addition to the green programming gap on a national channel, there is no formal education or consistent outreach being offered to citizens and communities. How are average Americans supposed to know what they can do to better understand our changing ecological systems, have a more positive impact and lighter footprint on our life support systems, both for nature's sake and our own?If not in mainstream media, what about academia? Sustainable solutions are being discussed on campuses across America in ecology clubs, Environmental Studies programs, and a few new Green MBA programs, but does that mean we should wait until the next generation comes of age armed with enough understanding to start digging out? If we do too little today their task will be that much larger tomorrow. There isn't enough time to turn over the shovel to Gen X, Y, or my daughter's Millennial generation, forcing them to clean up an even bigger mess later.  By ignoring the need to educate and engage Americans who have long since left the classroom, we are missing an opportunity -- and obligation -- to have all able-bodied citizens do their part.So who is talking about what we can do on channels that reach the masses?  Evidently, at least up until now, mainstream newspaper publishers and broadcast news editors have not seen it as their role or responsibility to offer eco-solutions.When Paul Rogers, an executive at the San Jose Mercury News, was questioned at a 2013 San Francisco Commonwealth Club panel about why his newspaper didn't offer more coverage on climate change solutions, he replied that it was the job of Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and other environmental NGOs, not the news media to inform on what steps people can take.While grass roots groups representing various green causes do their best to get media attention to cover these matters the news media powers-that-be assume it's up to the grassroots to get word out, if not to do the actual environmental clean-up needed.Therein lies the Catch-22 of just who is responsible for educating the public on climate and conservation tips?Meantime, with a handful of notable exceptions, corporate America doesn't see it as their obligation to accelerate eco-innovation or talk about valuing sustainability in their marketing. What about the federal government? I've often wondered why the EPA doesn't do substantive public outreach. How can we, as citizens, protect our environment if no one is telling us what to do or why it matters? The information is out there yes, but it has to be easily accessible and omnipresent in order to penetrate the zeitgeist.It is essential to establish mechanisms and media channels to bring average citizens into the conversation about conservation, and with all the breadth and depth needed to make rapid societal shifts.Failure to connect the dots between extreme weather events and climate disruption is a failure of leadership on the part of government, corporate America and my professional arena, major news media.It will be interesting to see how the news networks cover President Obama's trip to the Arctic this week. I suspect they will get on board this big media opportunity. However, just in case, perhaps Kim Kardashian should go along to ensure maximum exposure. Or maybe someone should send the omnipresent Donald Trump? Then again, no -- all his hot air may hasten the melting of Alaska's glaciers."}, {"title": "The New Favorite Charities of Animal Lovers", "text": "I'm no exception. Some of my first volunteering experiences were with my local animal shelter, and I spent many hours at a wolf sanctuary in Texas. I imagined opening my own sanctuary one day to make an even bigger difference.As I grew older, I became involved in \"effective altruism,\" a budding community of people who use evidence and reason to help others as much as possible. One organization taking this approach is GiveWell, a charity evaluator that finds and recommends outstanding giving opportunities to help the global poor. GiveWell moved over $27 million to their top charities in 2014 and are on track to move much more through their partnership with the foundation Good Ventures.The opportunity to do huge amounts of good, like deworming a child for just $0.50, was deeply exciting to me. And for a while, I worked towards a career in helping the global poor. Rather than feeling like a personal cost or sacrifice, this gave me happiness and motivation each day to wake up and have the impact I always wanted.A major component of effective altruism is continuously searching for the most promising cause areas where you can do the most good. Eventually, I realized many more animals needed my help than just those in animal shelters, and that the vast majority of animals directly harmed by humans were being largely neglected by policy-makers and charities.These are the animals raised and slaughtered in our food system, who have feelings and desires much like we do but are currently left out of most animal protection efforts. In fact, 360 farmed animals are killed in the United States for every dog or cat euthanized in a shelter. And Americans give at least $200 to animal shelters for every $10 given to farm animal charities.Over 99% of farmed animals in the U.S. are raised in cruel factory farms where they endure severe confinement like gestation crates for mother pigs that are so small they can't even turn around. Other abuses include painful mutilations such as castration without anesthetic. This horrific industry has been called by some in our generation the worst thing in the world.It was hard for me, like many others, to emotionally grasp the huge scale of farmed animal suffering. Scientists have shown that our minds block out compassion for mass tragedies, perhaps because we expect these groups will need more help than we can give them. One set of  experiments asked participants how much they were willing to pay to protect either 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds annually from drowning in oil-covered ponds after an oil spill. Participants said they would pay an average of $80, $78, and $88 respectively, failing to adjust for the exponential differences in scale.Fortunately, I think we can finally overcome this mental obstacle and tackle the issue of animal agriculture. Indeed, we already are. Today, animal protection is transforming into a movement that accounts for all species of animals. Just as our dogs and cats at home deserve happiness and protection, so too do the cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals we currently raise and slaughter for food. The fight against speciesism and the vision of a world without any animal suffering is now the forefront of the animal protection movement.But, to achieve this vision, we animal lovers (and others!) need to work together. We need to expand our horizons and ensure society doesn't leave any animals out of our moral scope. The charitable landscape for helping animals is no longer just animal shelters and wildlife sanctuaries. Charities creating big changes for farmed animals include The Humane Society of the United States, which recently announced a new ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would alleviate some of the worst confinement practices. Welfare reforms like these represent a major step towards a world where all animals can live without suffering.Two other farmed animal protection charities, Mercy for Animals and Animal Equality, regularly conduct undercover investigations to raise public awareness of the cruelty of animal agriculture. The Humane League uses grassroots outreach like leafleting and humane education lectures to inspire people to reduce their consumption of animal products, thus directly reducing the number of animals raised in these harsh conditions and creating new conversations about animal protection. Direct Action Everywhere uses confrontational tactics to spark public dialogue on animal issues, and New Harvest facilitates innovative work on cellular meat, eggs, and milk. Organizations like the Nonhuman Rights Project and Animal Ethics are taking long-term approaches to shift the entire legal and attitudinal landscape for animals.By supporting effective charities like these, spreading this message of antispeciesism, or getting involved in the effective altruism community, you can help build a world where all animals are treated with thoughtful consideration for their well-being."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Economic Impacts, An Islamic Call to Action, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.Saving Indonesia's Forests Helps Save Human And Forest Lives - like the famed orchid mantid, posing on an orchid.Forests: the cheapest way to store carbonThousands of fires, many illegally lit, destroy carbon-storing forests, produce harmful haze, and contribute to climate change annually in Indonesia.

But the main purpose of his trip is to use the media attention on his tour - amplified by an aggressive social media campaign - to convince Americans to take action.\"It's a really important punctuation mark on what he's saying is a top priority for him,\" said Sharon Burke, a former Pentagon official who worked on energy issues for Obama.\"It's the ultimate legacy issue because it is something that's going to affect so many generations of Americans,\" said Burke, now a senior adviser at the New America think tank.The hype for the tour began on Sunday with an announcement that Obama would rename North America's tallest mountain as Denali, restoring the traditional Alaska native name to what maps and tourists currently call Mount McKinley.When Obama lands in Anchorage, he will meet with a group of native leaders and elected officials before addressing an international conference on climate change in the Arctic.Environmental groups hope he will announce new reforms or restrictions for resource extraction while he is on the trip.\"It's an historic event for America and it comes at a critical time for the Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world,\" said Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska regional director of The Wilderness Society.During the past year, Obama took steps to seal off parts of the oil-rich state from new drilling, although environmental groups are howling about a recent decision to allow Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Chukchi Sea.Alaska's economy is based on oil and gas and the state has pushed to allow expanding the industry.Obama plans to hike the receding Exit Glacier in Seward on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he will fly to the salmon fishing mecca of Dillingham and then north of the Arctic Circle to the small town of Kotzebue.(Additional reporting by Steve Quinn in Juneau, Alaska; Editing by Dan Grebler)CORRECTION: This post has been updated to reflect the Exit Glacier is in Seward, not Sewell.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Is There Anything Cuter Than A Seal Getting A Belly Rub?", "text": "Sometimes there's nothing like a gray seal to brighten a gray day.A 2014 video of a diver giving a belly rub to an appreciative seal is seeing regained popularity thanks to a writeup this weekend in The Dodo. The underwater footage shows diver Gary Grayson encountering an Atlantic gray seal in Great Britain’s Scilly Isles, according the video’s description on YouTube.The friendly pinniped swims right up to Grayson, stroking the man with its flippers before rolling over to expose his belly. The diver responds how just about any person would when presented with such an adorable scene -- he scratches the seal’s belly.Though the video is adorable, scuba divers should not try this on their own. The video was shot in any area where seals have become very accustomed to human beings, which is not the case in most places.\"[The seal] is part of a colony where divers dive on a regular basis and so the seals have become, obviously, very used to people and allow them very close,\" Ally McMillan, director of Seal Rescue Ireland, located in County Wexford, Ireland, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Not all seals are like this, and if approached could well cause harm if they feel threatened due to their large size and very sharp teeth.\"\"Wildlife are better off being left wild,\" she added.Still, McMillan acknowledged that the video is pretty cute.\"It really shows how sweet, curious and dog-like [seals] are,\" she said.She noted that in some areas, the seal’s image desperately needs an overhaul.\"So many communities dislike seals and demonize them, calling them 'rats of the sea' or vermin, simply because they eat fish,\" she said. \"Many fishing communities do not like them, and illegally kill them thinking them as competition for the fish.\"McMillan also pointed out that it's been tough finding government support and adequate funding to keep Seal Rescue Ireland running, and she fears the nonprofit -- which has worked to rehabilitate seal pups and other wildlife in need for around four years -- will likely be closing down at the end of the year.\"[We’re] praying for a miracle before the inevitable happens,\" she said.Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.comThis article has been updated to include statements from Laura Sherr and John Gargett.Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the Marine Mammal Center was based in New Jersey.

The field keeps changing, and so constant study is required to keep current. At the end of last week, I paused for a moment in my own preparation to visit with K-12 educators, parents and staff at the Ross School, to discuss their work at bringing sustainability education to their students. Ross is a very impressive preK-12 educational institution on the east end of Long Island that brings an extraordinarily high quality educational experience to their students and has also created an institute that disseminates its innovative curriculum.In a draft statement of principles for the goal of integrating sustainability into their curriculum, I was struck by their deep understanding of the need to embed changes in education into new ways of thinking about how the world works. Their draft statement of principles noted that:Individuals, institutions, and governments all have a responsibility to safeguard the global environment, to protect the diversity of the biosphere and the diversity of human culture, and to preserve the Earth's natural and cultural resources for future generations.And it concluded by observing that:Solving these problems and transitioning our global society in the direction of a more sustainable relationship with the natural environment demands changes not only in education and policy, but also in our values, and the ability to communicate and cooperate across disciplinary, cultural, and political boundaries.At the Earth Institute, we have been engaged in efforts to develop curriculum to bring cutting edge sustainability science to K-12 educators, but it is not yet a central part of our work. Other organizations, such as Facing the Future, out of Western Washington University, have been conducting very effective sustainability teacher outreach and curriculum development for a number of years. It is fair to say that while K-12 educators have long held the future of our planet in their hands, their influence on young minds could not be more important than it is today. I believe that the key that unlocks the door to global sustainability is the ingenuity and creativity of the human species. Teaching young people to value the planet and the resources it provides is the way to ensure that our potential to solve the sustainability problem is achieved.When my children were engaged in K-12 education, I gave a great deal of thought to what they were learning and how their education was delivered. I know that is a common experience among contemporary parents. But I am far from an expert on the subject of K-12 education. When I was growing up, my mother was a PTA president, but parents back then were not deeply involved in curriculum development or in questioning the quality of their child's educational experience. I suppose it has to do with the evolution of the meaning of \"parent\" over the past half-century. When I was a kid, being a parent was a status one held. Today, one engages in \"parenting,\" a verb that connotes a series of activities, responsibilities and concerns. Engagement in a child's education experience makes sense because in the brain-based economy, education is even more central than ever to a child's long-term success and well-being. Last week I started to think about how important that learning process will be to achieving the transition to a sustainable and renewable global economy.What strikes me about the growth of sustainability in K-12 education is its capacity to be truly transformative. The stage of sustainability problem solving we find ourselves in today is riddled with misconceptions and ideological definitions of both problems and solutions. Politicians bring snowballs to the floor of congress to refute climate change and proudly proclaim their ignorance by declaring \"I am not a scientist.\" Environmental advocates sometimes fail to understand the political urgency of rapid economic development in developing nations, and climate scientists sometimes over-reach and propose politically infeasible environmental policies. My hope is that a generation of young people educated from Pre-K on to understand the sustainability challenge will approach it with a fresh and innovative perspective.This means that sustainability curriculum must teach scientific, economic, social, cultural and political facts and concepts to help students understand sustainability problems, but must be careful about prescribing solutions. Dogma and environmental determinism needs to be avoided. Straight-line projections about the future based on current trends should be avoided and replaced by multiple projections based on varied assumptions. History is difficult enough to understand; predicting the future is as much craft as it is science. The challenges that humanity faces can be addressed, but they require a deep understanding of the tradeoffs caused by our modern lifestyle. The sustainability curriculum at all levels should stress interdisciplinary exchange and learning, team work and problem solving methodologies.The challenge of sustainability is the seductiveness and appeal of our current mode of consumption and our way of life: instant information at the push of a button; instant entertainment at the push of the same button; creature comforts like climate control, plentiful, fresh and tasty food, mobility, time for leisure and relationships. The list is nearly endless. No one is going to willingly give that up and billions of people on the planet are aspiring to share in that lifestyle. We need to transform economic production and consumption while increasing its volume. A higher proportion of economic consumption will include less material-based goods and services, such as education, research, entertainment, social interaction, crafts, art and physical fitness.The transition to a sustainable economy requires that we transform our production and consumption processes to reduce their impact on natural planetary systems. This means that young people must learn about those systems, how they function, how we make use of them, how we endanger them and how we might protect them. Our goal should be to maintain our way of life and expand it to others who seek it, without damaging the planet. That will not be an easy goal to achieve, but surely having young people learn about it as part of their fundamental understanding of how the world works is an urgent and critical task.While I acknowledge the importance of shaping young minds, my own work as an educator is focused on professional education for people working right now on environmental policy and sustainability management. The transition to a renewable economy requires education at every level. We need students in public and private schools to develop a deeper understanding of the global sustainability crisis, but we also need aspiring professionals and current professionals to develop the expertise needed to begin the transformation in real time, today. In organizations all over America and all over the world, young people are pushing older people to develop and implement sustainable practices and organizations. Many professionals are returning to school to learn about sustainability, and many aspiring professionals are focusing their undergraduate and graduate education on sustainability science, engineering, policy, management, architecture, design, communication, and art.I feel fortunate to work in a place where I am constantly exposed to the creativity and energy of students looking to make the world a better place. It fuels my sense of optimism and hope that we can research, teach and learn our way out of the world's current crisis of sustainability. I suspect I will receive even more reinforcement when I welcome our new sustainability management master's students on Tuesday and welcome back students in Columbia's environmental science and policy program the following week. My visit last week to the Ross School reinforced my positive outlook. If I am lucky enough to be teaching in 15 years, I would welcome the challenge of teaching a Ross student who first learned about sustainability when she was four years old..."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: The Vegetable Lady and the Easy-Going Overachiever -- Kathy Hester and \"The Easy Vegan\"", "text": "Recipe developer, slow cooker guru, pr pro, cooking instructor and five-time cookbook author Kathy Hester owes her success to being an overachiever who's not afraid to fail. \"You can't be successful at something unless you're willing to fail brilliantly,\" she says. \"I do some boneheaded things just to see if it'll work.\" With her new book, \"The Easy Vegan,\" she's done the hard work to make it easy in the kitchen for \"normal people who don't like a lot of stress in their lives.\" That's probably you.Though as stress-averse as the next guy, Hester's happiest \"being in the kitchen, experimenting.

But the two combatants seemed oblivious to the terrifying strangeness of the scene.Python versus cobra -- the fight was on.Passers-by on Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University campus were shocked last Thursday when what’s believed to be a reticulated python and a king cobra began “fighting” each other on the street.Channel NewsAsia reports that the reptile wrestling match went on for about 30 minutes before the highly-venomous cobra, estimated to be around 10 to 12 feet in length, finally “escaped to the bushes.”PhD student Abhishek Ambede told the news outlet that at one point in the fight, the python “had constricted around the cobra’s head.”According to The Straits Times, pest control officers managed to capture both snakes.The python was caught at the site of the fight (you can watch its capture in the video above); while the cobra was nabbed hours later.The cobra was reportedly relocated to a zoo, while the python was released into a forested area nearby.Ambede said in a Facebook post that the cobra is believed to have bitten the python during the encounter.“Its chances of survival” are thus “very low,” he wrote.Despite being largely covered by concrete, highways and skyscrapers, Singapore is home to many snakes, including several varieties of coral snake, pit viper and cobra.A 2014 The Straits Times report said that pythons -- non-venomous constrictors -- are the most common type of snake in Singapore.Though big, pythons are typically shy creatures that stay away from humans.

McKinley's Name To Denali On Alaska Trip", "text": "WASHINGTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday will officially restore Denali as the name of North America's tallest mountain, siding with the state of Alaska in ending a 40-year battle over what to call a peak that has been known as Mount McKinley.The historic change, coming at the beginning of a three-day presidential trip to Alaska, is a sign of how hard the White House will push during Obama's remaining 16 months as president to ensure his fight to address climate change is part of his legacy.Renaming the mountain, which has an elevation of more than 20,000 feet (6,100 meters), makes headlines for his climate quest while also creating goodwill in a state that has not been broadly supportive to the Democratic president.Obama is slated to tour a receding glacier and meet people in remote Arctic communities whose way of life is affected by rising ocean levels, creating images designed to build support for regulations to curb carbon emissions.The peak was named Mount McKinley in 1896 after a gold prospector exploring the region heard that Ohioan William McKinley, a champion of the gold standard, had won the Republican nomination for president.But Alaska natives had long before called the mountain Denali, meaning \"the High One.\" In 1975, the state of Alaska officially designated the mountain as Denali, and has since been pressing the federal government to do the same.Alaskans had been blocked in Congress by Ohio politicians, who wanted to stick with McKinley as a lasting tribute to the 25th U.S. president, who served from 1897 until his assassination in 1901.Under Obama's action, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will use her legal authority to end the long debate and rename the mountain.The move elicited praise from Alaska Governor Bill Walker, a Republican turned independent, and Republican elected officials, who more typically are critical of an administration they see as hostile to the oil and gas interests of their state.\"I'd like to thank the president for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor, respect, and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska,\" said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who led the fight for the Denali name in Congress.But Ohio Senator Rob Portman said he was disappointed in what he called \"yet another example of the president going around Congress.\" He urged the White House to find another way to honor McKinley in Denali National Park.

If kids want to enjoy school, be inspired, maintain their desires for discovery, and have fun, they need to find their own pace at learning and not be pressured into doing more or less.It's up to us as parents to find the right balance to encourage our kids to stretch themselves without feeling overly stressed and avoidant of learning. Here are 10 ways to do just that:Ten Ways To Help Kids Find Their Own Score Card1. Ask your kids what interested them in their school day?2. Encourage them to explore these interests beyond the scope of their assignments if they find it fun. Google the heck out of new ideas. Check Wikipedia for other points of view.3. Use resources from the environment, the library, friends who enjoy the same topic.4. Forget measuring how well you perform and concentrate on the joy of learning.5. Make grades less important than the excitement of making a new discovery.6. Draw pictures and write stories about interesting ideas and post them on facebook.7. Measure your success by how many new ideas you come up with not by test scores.8. Post YouTube videos of projects that you complete and get comments.9. Inspire others to follow your ideas on social media and get an interaction going.10. Learn for its own sake and grades improve naturally.Ted TalksOnce kids are in middle school and high school introduce them to Ted Talks for all kinds of new innovative ideas about science and math and the environment. Watch the shows with them to field questions and learn together. It's a great audio and visual experience to join millions of other listeners. The audience is filled with adults but most of the talks teens can follow and be really excited by.It's a great plus for parents and kids to be learning together. Suddenly dinner conversations are inspiring and exciting. Learning is going at the teens' own pace and pace becomes exponential because they are following subjects that intrigue them. Discovery is the motivation, not tests and performance.  As an adult, you discover you are learning from your kids. This is a terrific experience that goes far beyond the walls of schools. You find yourself reading at your own pace on the topics that your child has drawn your attention to. If we want to keep up with our kids, we need to learn what they are learning. Turn on to their music, their art, their ezines and chat rooms (if they let you) and learn what they learn.  It's unbelievably energizing and everyone learns together.Laurie Hollman, Ph.D. has a new book coming out, Unlocking Parental Intelligence: Finding Meaning in Your Child's Behavior."}, {"title": "5 Post-Katrina Innovations New Orleans Can Brag About", "text": "By Catherine Schuknecht  The Green Project's paint-recycling program. | Photo courtesy of Christal White/The Green ProjectIt's been 10 years since Hurricane Katrina made landfall, taking the lives of 1,500 people and destroying countless homes, churches, businesses, and schools. The people of New Orleans have spent a decade rebuilding their city, but not everyone has felt the full impact of the recovery effort. A recent survey revealed a stark racial divide in how residents perceive improvements to infrastructure and their standard of living. But don't be too discouraged: We found five green innovations that have taken root since the storm and that are improving the lives of citizens across the board.  1. OysterBreak The world is your oyster. At least it is for Tyler Ortego, Matt Campbell, and two professors at Louisiana State University, who invented the OysterBreak system in 2005 and brought coastal protection to life, literally. The system, which is essentially a chain of huge linked concrete cylinders, is made of an oyster-growing substrate that, once installed, is colonized by oyster larvae and eventually grows into a living reef. Because these solid reefs grow faster than sea levels rise, they reduce shoreline erosion. ORA Estuaries, the company that Ortego founded in 2010 to run the building and distribution of the oyster reefs, recently won The Big Idea pitch competition at the 2015 New Orleans Entrepreneur Week. As of yet, the oysters can't be eaten, but Ortego is working on engineering the reefs to double as a sustainable food source.2. Public Lab New Orleans residents are bringing DIY to environmental protection. Powered by civic engagement, Public Lab is a nonprofit network of locals who are working to make sophisticated environmental monitoring tools accessible to the general public. They cover everything from water quality evaluation to aerial mapping, coming up with innovative ways to make complex monitoring devices out of inexpensive materials. Travis Haas, an environmental science teacher at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, and his eleventh grade students recently collaborated with Public Lab to map and assess the progress of wetland restoration. Acting as citizen scientists, the high schoolers launched a helium balloon attached to a camera and used Public Lab's MapKnitter software to piece together the photographs it collected.3. The Green Project New Orleans residents say that Hurricane Katrina created 20 years of waste in a single day. True or not, the disaster left the city sitting on over 55 million tons of debris. Enter The Green Project. Founded in 1994 as a paint-recycling business, the New Orleans-based nonprofit stepped up after Katrina, taking materials from destroyed homes and reinvesting them into community rebuilding projects. Ten years later, The Green Project is thriving. The project promotes creative repurposing and prides itself on being accessible to all populations--materials are sold to community members at one-fifth of new retail costs. It also has the only paint-recycling program in the Gulf region and leads regular community recycling education workshops. We agree, it's pretty much the whole package.4. Water Wise It wouldn't be New Orleans without stormwater management. In 2013, Global Green USA launched its Water Wise NOLA program in New Orleans to advocate for simple solutions to water-related issues, such as flooding and substandard water quality. The organization is working to help residents lower their water bills by reducing consumption and promoting rainwater management. And they host regular rain-barrel builds--does it get better than that?5. Eco-Friendly Transportation Don't worry; the city government is making an effort to green-ify New Orleans, too. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the city's public transportation system in 2005, the Regional Transit Authority was tasked with a massive reconstruction project. Although the bus service is still operating at 35% of pre-Katrina levels, the RTA has made progress. Today, the transit network's entire fleet is run on biodiesel and sixteen of their buses are biodiesel/electric hybrids. The city has also made pedestrian-friendly improvements to its streetlights. Since 2014, over 4,000 of them have been replaced with energy-efficient LED lights as part of the city's ongoing Energy Smart Streetlight Conversion Program. We'd call that a step toward a brighter future."}, {"title": "Why The Debate Over Europe's Migration Crisis Is Full Of Myths", "text": "Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Hein de Haas, professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam and former co-director of the International Migration Institute.European nations' struggle to cope with an influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees in recent years has exacerbated a growing humanitarian crisis in the region.The number of people seeking a better life in Europe currently shows no signs of decline. Countries including Germany and France have signaled the need to create a cohesive common policy that could address this migration, but EU leaders have so far rejected plans like spreading asylum claims throughout the union.Hein de Haas, a professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam and former co-director of Oxford's International Migration Institute, believes that this debate over migration is lacking a number of key facts. The WorldPost spoke with De Haas to discuss some of the myths surrounding policy making and migration.You wrote in a blog post that “much conventional thinking about migration is based on myths rather than facts.” Could you clarify that idea?A lot of policy making around migration is based on politics rather than a real understanding of migration. The primary aim of a lot of politicians when talking about migration is to give the public the impression that they’re going tough on migration, but reactions like building a fence, deporting migrants or increasing border controls are not really based on real insight of what drives migration and are therefore ineffective.A lot of politics is relatively fact-free in this arena, and we need to much better understand what drives migration before we can form the right policies.We should acknowledge that to a certain extent migration is inevitable, and that saying that is not a judgment on whether migration is something good or bad, it’s just a statement of fact.Are you referring to people who are migrating because of economic reasons, or does that also include forced migration and people who would be classified as refugees?The vast majority of migration is still economic migration and family migration. What we’ve seen in Europe right now -- where the issue of refugees has come to the fore -- that’s still a minority of migrants coming to Europe.The main drivers of migration are clearly economic and social, and there I think there’s a failure to understand how migration works.To give you one example, there’s the myth that in order to prevent irregular border crossings we should combat smuggling. It’s based on a failure to understand that the smuggling is a reaction to the border controls, and that where there is a systemic demand for labor migration or conflict in origin countries, it means that some level of migration is inevitable.In terms of this latest period of European migration in the last few years, is there a certain type of language we should be using to describe it? It's been termed both a \"refugee crisis\" and a \"period of forced migration.\"As a matter of framing, the real crisis is not about migration or refugees. The real crisis in Europe is the incompetence of Europe to come to a common response.With more than half a billion inhabitants, the European Union has the resources to cope with this, and can make sure that people arriving at the European border get access to asylum procedures.These are big numbers if you are reading about a small island like Kos with tens of thousands of people arriving, but not on a European scale. And not if Europe would get its act together and show real solidarity -- not just between member states, but also towards the people arriving.The big increase we’ve seen in irregular migration is clearly people fleeing conflict, with a large percentage of them Syrian. We have asylum procedures in place, we have an international legal framework in place for that. The real crisis is European impotence to respond, and it would be outrageous if Europe can’t cope with that when the vast majority of refugees are in much poorer countries like Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.How is this migration into the EU affecting European economies?As far as the impact of migration, there is a lot of research on that, and it shows that migration increases GDP because migrants add to the workforce. There’s very little real evidence to support the claim that migration is crowding out labor or bringing down wages.However, various studies have shown that the effect on migration on GDP per capita and growth is very small and it is, apart from the migrants themselves, primarily businesses and the higher income earners that benefit from migration. In public debates, the negative or positive effects of migration are generally exaggerated by adversaries or proponents of migration. Migration is primarily driven by economic processes, but it’s not a big economic game-changer.It would be outrageous to suggest that migration is either the cause of structural unemployment, which is one example, or the precariousness of labor. Or, on the other hand, to propose that migration is a panacea for structural problems like aging.What is missing from media coverage and representations of migration?What is really missing is an understanding of how the way we have reshaped societies and economies over the last decades has also changed the structure of labor demand and migration.There is a huge incompatibility between economic policies that have very much trended towards liberalization, increasing economic openness and deregulation of labor markets on one hand and on the other hand an increasing call for less migration.If you create societies that are wealthy, open and de-regularized, then you also create much more demand for migrant labor. These societies inevitably attract migration, and if you close the door, we know what you get -- you get more smuggling and more irregular migration because there are no legal channels to match the labor demand.So I think that’s the biggest trouble and biggest lack of understanding. There is a sort of progress in people’s understanding of migration though. For instance, people increasingly realize that 25 years of fortress Europe have completely failed. People are arriving anyway, and the main result has been an increase of smuggling, suffering of migrants and the number of recorded border deaths.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "A Photo From The Moscow Zoo Vividly Captures Life In Captivity", "text": "This is a Sumatran orangutan in the Moscow Zoo.We asked Chris Draper, program manager for captive wild animals at the Born Free Foundation in the U.K., to comment on the photograph."}, {"title": "A Photo From The Moscow Zoo Vividly Captures Life In Captivity", "text": "This is a Sumatran orangutan in the Moscow Zoo.We asked Chris Draper, program manager for captive wild animals at the Born Free Foundation in the U.K., to comment on the photograph."}, {"title": "New Orleans Marks 10 Years Since Hurricane Katrina", "text": "By Kathy Finn and Edward McAllisterNEW ORLEANS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - New Orleans, a town renowned for staging big celebrations, faces a tricky challenge on Saturday, 10 years to the day from when Hurricane Katrina slammed into southeast Louisiana and triggered flooding that would leave 80 percent of the city under water.The city wants to recognize the progress it has made in recovering from the most costly storm in U.S. history. Thousands of people are expected to turn out as the city's trademark \"second line\" parades snake through the streets and New Orleans puts its famous musical traditions on display.But Saturday is also a time to remember more than 1,500 New Orleanians who were killed by Katrina and its aftermath, and the 130,000 residents who were displaced.\"A celebration would not be the right gesture for those who will never be made whole,\" said Kristian Sonnier, an official at the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"This is more taking stock and recognizing what we have accomplished and that we have a lot more work to do,\" he said.Saturday will cap a week of self-examination that has included panel discussions by urban planners, elected officials, recovery experts, architects and neighborhood leaders.The day begins early with a wreath-laying ceremony in one of the city's historic above-ground cemeteries, the site of the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. The remains of 83 \"forgotten\" victims have rested there since 2008, their bodies never claimed by relatives. Mayor Mitch Landrieu will pay tribute to them during a brief service.Other places that were hard-hit will host memorials as well. At Shell Beach, in lower St. Bernard Parish just east of New Orleans, public officials and residents will gather along a waterway that burst through a levee in 2005 and killed 127 people. The ceremony will feature a reading of the names of victims, now etched into a monument there.Tributes are slated in the city's Lower Ninth Ward, where surging waters broke a floodwall on the city's Industrial Canal and devastated the entire neighborhood. Similarly, Lakeview, Broadmoor, Mid-City and a host of other areas are looking back on 2005 with mixed emotions.\"There aren't enough words to describe the loss, especially for the people of the Lower Ninth Ward, because the breach that drowned their neighborhood was the worst in the city,\" said civic activist Sandy Rosenthal on Friday, just after she had walked in a second-line parade through the ward.At the same time, she says, the progress the city has made in 10 years is undeniable.A march and hand-holding ceremony is scheduled at the city's Superdome, which housed thousands of displaced people after the storm and became an emblem of the chaos and hardship that engulfed New Orleans after the flooding.\"It's a great feeling to see that so many people have come back to the city and are doing well, but depression sets in when you think of those who died or those who want to come back but haven't been able to return,\" said Barbara Blackwell, whose home in the Gentilly neighborhood was a casualty of the flood.\"I know that for many people, this anniversary unearths old wounds, but it's also a healing process,\" Blackwell said. \"The pain never goes away, but it helps to know that loved ones who were lost are being remembered.\"While some residents find it hard to look back, many are heartened to see that national figures continue to show concern and admiration for New Orleans.President Barack Obama paid tribute to the city’s recovery in a visit to the Lower Ninth Ward on Thursday. “I am inspired by you,” he told his audience at a local community center.Former President George W. Bush, who critics say was slow to respond to the unfolding crisis a decade ago, visited the city on Friday. Former President Bill Clinton will address a gathering at a downtown arena on Saturday that will also feature a lineup of well-known local musicians.(Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Shumaker)"}, {"title": "Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Sees A Mesmerizing River Of Lava", "text": "Need a reminder of Mother Nature's might? Then, boy, do we have the video for you.A large lava breakout began early Thursday morning from the Puʻu ʻŌʻō cone of Kilauea volcano on the southeast part of Hawaii's Big Island.In the footage above, the glowing breakout is seen flowing through a landscape of black lava rock, on the northeast flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō.Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and Puʻu ʻŌʻō in particular has been continuously erupting for more than 32 years.According to the U.S. Geological Survey's daily Kilauea updates, the lava initially broke out on Thursday around 1 a.m. local time. The breakout stemmed from a lava tube currently feeding other flows further to the northeast.\"It is too soon to tell how important this breakout is or if it will affect the vigor of the distant flows to the northeast,\" the USGS wrote in Thursday's update. The flow remained active into Thursday evening, but has since stalled.For those who live on the Big Island, lava flows are an accepted and, at times, trying part of life. Last year, for instance, the small rural community of Pahoa was threatened by a flow that burned one house down.Videographer Mick Kalber, who captured the footage above, told Big Island Video News that the breakout was about 3 miles from residential communities.While USGS is monitoring it closely, the flow does not currently pose a threat to Big Island communities. According to Christina Neal, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientist-in-charge, this breakout was simply a \"burp of lava.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Our Future Generations Can Teach Us a Thing or Two About Arctic Drilling", "text": "Last week, President Obama made a terribly risky decision for the Arctic. His administration cleared the final hurdle that allows for drilling into oil-bearing zones in the Arctic Ocean, approving one of Shell Oil's modified drilling permits for the Chukchi Sea. That decision puts the fate of the fragile Arctic Ocean, and a piece of our climate future, in the hands of Shell - a company with a track record of stumbles and mishaps in the Arctic that hardly inspires confidence.To put this decision into context, it's important to understand the climate legacy President Obama has sought to put into place for himself. Obama's climate policy was born of a commitment to acting on climate change for the sake of future generations, a commitment seemingly at odds with green-lighting the drilling for and burning of the billions of barrels of oil currently locked up beneath the Chukchi Sea.Just last month, in more than 20 events across 15 states, citizens across the country banded together in a nationwide protest calling on President Obama to stop Shell - or any other oil company - from drilling in the Arctic Ocean. And one of the most compelling voices from that day of action came from the \"future generations\" that President Obama is seeking to protect - our kids and grandkids, who will bear the brunt of climate change should we continue down our current road of fossil fuel dependence.Bella Parra, all of 11 years old, stood among her peers a stone's throw away from Lake Michigan in Chicago - President Obama's hometown - and spoke out about Arctic drilling:Hi, my name is Bella Parra, daughter of Barbara Klipp, and I (like all of you) strongly dislike Shell's plans for our future! When my mom told me that Shell was planning to drill in the Arctic, I got so mad. Two times I went to Washington, D.C., for Alaska Wilderness Week and I learned so much about Alaska and wildlife. We learned about indigenous people, caribou, polar bears, and all kinds of ocean animals like whales and lots more. I probably learned more there than I learn in school. I thought of what could happen to the wildlife that's been there for ages.As Bella said, we can't ignore the signs of climate change in the Arctic, or the impacts that an Arctic drilling program will have on our nation's climate future. Iconic species like walrus, polar bears and bowhead whales are already being impacted by the disappearance of Arctic ice and other long term impacts from climate change, and now will be subjected to disturbances from Shell's drilling program as well.Whatever happens this summer, the world will be watching. Millions of Americans have come forward to save the Arctic from both climate disaster and the potential for devastating spills -- but this fight is just beginning.Five years on from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, and wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico continues to suffer. Earlier this month, the National Climatic Data Center revealed 2015 to be breaking global temperature records. It's time to safeguard the Arctic and our nation's climate future - our children don't deserve to pay for our mistakes."}, {"title": "California Climate Bills Could Set A High Bar For The Rest Of The Country", "text": "As states prepare to develop plans for meeting new greenhouse gas standards from the Environmental Protection Agency, they might look to California as an example of what's possible.Right now, the California legislature is considering two bills, SB 32 and 350, which would allow the state to meet interim climate goals that Gov. Jerry Brown (D) established through an executive order in April. Brown's order calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, a stopping point along the path to reaching an 80 percent cut by 2050 -- a goal scientists have said is necessary to preventing the worst impacts of climate change.The state is already on pace to bring emissions down to 1990 levels by 2020, a goal established in the landmark state law known as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The latest bills would set the state up for long-term reductions and establish specific energy goals to make that possible.SB 32, from state Sen. Fran Pavley (D), would inscribe the 2030 and 2050 targets in state law. SB 350, from Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León (D) and Sen. Mark Leno (D), would increase the amount of energy the state is required to draw from renewables 50 percent, reduce petroleum use 50 percent, and improve the energy efficiency of buildings 50 percent, all by the year 2030. The bills have both passed in the state Senate, and the assembly is expected to debate the bills in the next few weeks.Lawmakers said the bills will allow the legislature to shape the state's goals. \"The governor is moving forward with or without us,\" Pavley said Tuesday in a press conference. \"I want the legislature to engage in this process.\"They're also pointing to the success the state has had in meeting the goals laid out in their 2006 bill. \"Ten years ago we didn't know if all of this was possible,\" Pavley said. \"We know today that we can do this, and that we have a moral imperative to do this.\"Advocates cited the advances the state has made since the 2006 law was passed: It claims 430,000 jobs in the advance energy field, has more than 100,000 electric vehicles on the road and is on pace to hit 25 percent renewable energy by the end of 2016. All as the state's economy has continued to grow.\"Skeptics have said that our clean air policies would destroy the economy, that we set unrealistic targets,\" de León said at the presser, where he was joined by leaders from a number of California businesses that support the bills. \"And yet here we are today, well on the way to meeting those targets with an economy that is stronger than ever, that is the envy of other states.\"That's not to say the bills aren't meeting opposition, particularly from the oil industry, which is not a fan of the goal of cutting petroleum use in half.\"California’s petroleum industry is proud to produce the world’s cleanest gasoline and diesel,\" Western States Petroleum Association President Catherine Reheis-Boyd said in a statement. \"Ultimately, Californians will be best served by inclusive public policy that protects our environment and supports a thriving economy.\"Utilities in the state have been more supportive, but may seek some changes in the Assembly bill, according to the Los Angeles Times.For environmental groups, passing these two bills into law will ensure some permanence for climate policy. \"A new governor can dispose of [Brown's executive order] as he or she sees fit,\" said David Pettit, director of the southern California air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"It's a different story if you see it in legislation. It puts this in concrete, so to speak.\"The bills again set California up to be a leader on climate policy nationally, particularly when it comes to setting interim targets.\"Having a long-term goal is usually based on what the science says is necessary, while setting a medium-term goal combines looking at where you need to be in 2050 with some analysis of how you get there over the next decade or two,\" said Gabriel Pacyniak, the climate change mitigation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center. \"It's really combining both -- a 'where we need to go' approach and a 'how do we get there' approach.\"Clean air policy is also an area where California has led historically -- \"purely out of necessity,\" said Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. The state's large population and pollution-trapping topography have long create air quality concerns; the five worst cities for air pollution in the U.S. are all in California.\"There are a lot of instances where we've really screwed up, especially on agriculture and the way we abuse water,\" Gerston said. \"But when it comes to energy and environment, we're way ahead of everybody.\"Advocates are hopeful that, as it did with the 2006 law, California can once again be a model for other states.\"I think the biggest lesson conceptually is that you can have a robust greenhouse gas reduction program and grow the economy at the same time,\" Pettit said. \"That happened here. I don't see any reason it can't happen in every other state.\""}, {"title": "Crops Ahoy: Farms That Float", "text": "By Don WilllmottNo Land? No Problem. If Barcelona-based Forward Thinking Architecture has its way, farms of the future will operate autonomously as they float on the open sea. Stretching eco-friendly concepts to the limit, the ambitious design firm has come up with the idea of Smart Floating Farms, large triple-decker agriculture barges that feature fish farms down below, hydroponic gardens up top, and solar panels on the roof to keep things running. They don't exist yet, but they're certainly providing plenty of food for thought.The concept hits all the current buzzwords: preservation of arable land, local organic food sourcing with less \"food mileage,\" environmental protection, self-sufficiency and sustainability.Much of the power needed for the floating farm would come from rooftop solar arrays. (Source: Forward Thinking Architecture)What the designers have in mind is a rectangular farm with a default size of 656 by 1,150 feet and a total area across all its levels of about 2.2 million square feet. Space that isn't used for farming would be taken up by service walkways and catwalks. Since the floating farms would be modular, several could be clustered together to improve their efficiency even more to serve densely populated areas.The bottom level would contain fish farms, external perimeter wave barriers and protection, water access points, storage, a slaughterhouse, a desalination plant, and a packaging facility. Upstairs would be a greenhouse with automated hydroponics, and microclimate control for crop cultivation. The rooftop level would hold a photovoltaic power plant and feature skylights to deliver natural light to the plants. Wind turbines and wave energy converter systems could also play a role, as could biogas power plants and digesters that would be used to eliminate the biological waste produced throughout the operation.The bottom level would be used for fish farming. (Source: Forward Thinking Architecture)The most important component would be the hydroponic garden, because hydroponics doesn't require natural precipitation, fertile land, or pesticides to be effective and can serve as a model for people who live in arid regions or areas with poor soil. Hydroponic gardens can also be stacked, so they take up less space.Hanging hydroponic gardens would be designed for maximum productivity. (Source: Forward Thinking Architecture)The designers contend that all of this could--at least in theory--operate pretty much automatically, with minimal human intervention. The key would be to place sensors everywhere and rely on the gadgetry of the \"Internet of Things\" to report data that would ultimately help the farm run at peak efficiency, although details about all that are fuzzy for now. Meanwhile, big data analytics would also be used to determine what the local populace needed most from the floating farms. Fewer fish and more lettuce perhaps?Forward Thinking Architecture says that one regular farm would yield 8.1 tons of vegetables and 1.7 tons of fish per year, which would let the farm pay for itself within 10 years.

Seven years later, we looked at how he's keeping up with those promises.Environment\"For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\"While the United States' dependence on foreign oil has been declining since 2005, the United States is still importing crude oil from Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Some have projected the United States to be energy independent by 2035.As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.Natural gas reserves have increased under Obama, in large part because of the process known as fracking, which has raised concerns among environmental advocates. The Washington Post reported in February that the Department of Energy had invested $6 billion in clean coal technology.In 2009, Obama released a plan to put 1 million cars with advanced technology on the road by 2015 by offering a combination of consumer rebates and giving car companies money to develop more efficient vehicles.In March, the Obama administration cut back on its purchase goals for consumers. Since Obama took office, the United States government has bought just under 25,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Bloomberg reported that consumers in the U.S. bought 286,814 of these models between 2009-2014, accounting for 3 percent of overall sales, which was helped by a spike in gas prices in the summer 2008. In 2012, the Obama administration also issued new rules that would nearly double the required fuel efficiency for new cars and trucks by 2025.Despite having 61 operational nuclear power plants, and 99 nuclear reactors, there is still no permanent nuclear waste facility in the United States, The New Republic reported in January.And I'll invest $150 billion over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy -- wind power, and solar power, and the next generation of biofuels -- an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.In 2012, a Brookings Institution report projected that the Obama administration would spend about $150 billion on solar power and other renewable energy sources between 2009 and 2014.EducationI'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries, and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.While funding for early childhood education did get a bump with the stimulus when Obama first took office, funding only slightly increased between 2008 and 2013. In December, Obama announced a $1 billion investment in early childhood programs through a combination of public and private sources.While Obama increased merit pay for some teachers through his Race To The Top Program, a teacher service scholarship that he promised during his campaign never came to light.Race To The Top, the signature education policy of Obama's presidency, offered incentives to states to raise educational standards, improve student performance and recruit new teachers. But the program has faced criticism for focusing too much on testing and tying teacher evaluations to test scores.And we will keep our promise to every young American: If you commit to serving your community or our country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.In 2009, Obama signed legislation that extended GI benefits to help veterans who served after Sept. 11 pay for college. In 2012, Obama also signed an executive order protecting veterans from deceptive practices by for-profit colleges. However, Senate Democrats have accused the Department of Education of misleading the public when it cleared its student loan servicers of cheating service members on their loans.TaxesYou know, unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.I'll eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and startups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.I will cut taxes -- cut taxes -- for 95 percent of all working families, because, in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.Obama has been unsuccessful in his efforts to close tax loopholes for companies to move jobs to other countries. Obama did attempt to address this by including proposed changes in his fiscal year 2014 budget. But Democrat-sponsored bills introduced to disincentives this failed in Congress in both 2012 and 2014.In 2010, Obama signed a bill temporarily eliminating the capital gains tax for small business investments. While it was extended through 2011, the exclusion rate for small businesses reverted back to the pre-Obama level of 50 percent in 2012.Obama’s stimulus in 2009 cut taxes for 95 percent -- 94.3 percent to be exact -- of working families, allowing him to quickly follow through on his promise to do so.HealthcareIf you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or an ailing parent.Most health care premiums have actually increased since the Obamacare exchanges opened in 2013. Under the law, members of Congress now get their employer insurance through the exchanges -- the same place uninsured Americans can get coverage.The Affordable Care Act does prohibit insurance companies from denying health care coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. However, there are loopholes in the act that insurance companies can take advantage of to avoid paying for their coverage.The U.S. is the only OECD country that does not mandate paid sick or family leave. While Obama is taking steps this year to guarantee paid sick and family leave for federal workers, he has been unable to do so for the rest of the country. He did bring new attention to the issue during his 2015 State of the Union address, calling on Congress to pass a bill guaranteeing seven days of paid sick leave.EconomyNow is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses, and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.Obama has not taken action to reform Social Security while in office, though he once considered cutting benefits as part of a deal to get Republicans to go along with a deficit reduction deal. He eventually abandoned the proposal. In 2013, a judge in Detroit also ruled that employee pensions could be cut in bankruptcy.And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons.The very first bill that Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, which gave workers more time to sue for descrimination. The Obama administration has made a pretty good effort at tackling the gender pay gap through executive actions, educational apps, memorandums, and the creation of a national equal pay task force. Although Obama has instructed federal contractors to report wage details by gender, Republicans have blocked equal pay legislation multiple times.Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime: by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.Last year, the Treasury issued new tax rules to disincentivize companies from moving their headquarters to a tax-friendly country while maintaining operations in the United States.But I will also go through the federal budget line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less, because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.Shortly after he took office, Obama signed a spending bill that contained earmarks that he admitted he objected to. In 2011, Congress banned earmarks -- money allocated for lawmakers' pet projects -- although some members have more recently been calling for the earmarks to return.Foreign policyAs commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.Last year, the Obama authorized the United States to begin airstrikes against the Islamic State, but didn't submit a formal proposal to Congress authorizing force until several months later -- a proposal that lawmakers are still considering.In April, Obama described his foreign policy doctrine as \"we will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.” In 2013, Obama seemed to be on the verge of attacking Syria after convincing signs that President Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons on its citizens, but abruptly changed course and decided to ask Congress for approval. That vote was avoided when Syria agreed to turn over what it portrayed as its stockpile of chemical weapons.Obama has kept his promise to veterans to get them the care that they need by keeping the VA fully funded, increasing VA access in rural areas, and expanding housing vouchers for homeless vets.But last year it was revealed that the VA kept secret waiting lists and and deliberately hid long wait times for veterans. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and prompted Congress to pass legislation to reform the agency. Despite that reform, a rigid bureaucracy remains in place -- documents obtained by The Huffington Post in July showed that more than 238,000 of the 847,000 veterans with pending applications for health care through the agency had died.I will end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.The last U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011 under a timetable that was initially negotiated by the administration of former President George W. Bush. Since then, Obama has ordered the deployment of more troops to Iraq to train Iraqi soldiers fight ISIS.Obama authorized the successful mission that killed Osama bin Laden, the head of al Qaeda, in 2011, but the terrorist group has retained a strong presence in Syria and Yemen.I will rebuild our military to meet future conflictsDefense spending under the Obama administration has declined since 2010, but spending is still 45 percent higher than pre-9/11 levels. There has been a push to retool how the military is funded, and that would be where Obama really has earned the bragging rights to say that he kept this promise.. The force may be getting trim at the request of the administration, but more resources are going towards next-generation warfare like cybersecurity and drone programs, and less spending on older programs like fighter jets and warthogs.I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.In July, the United States and five other countries -- including Russia -- reached an agreement that will require the country to drastically downsize the amount of nuclear material that it has in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation, poverty and genocide, climate change and disease.The United States partnered with five countries -- the United Kingdom, China, Russia, Germany, France -- to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran. After nearly 50 years of hostility, the Obama administration also normalized relations with Cuba.Obama has also expanded the United States' trade partners through an agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 Pacific countries. Some have raised objections to the deal over the human rights records of some of the countries involved.Gun ControlThe reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.There have been numerous mass shootings since Obama has taken office. While he has issued 23 executive orders on gun control, Obama has said that failure to pass gun reform in Congress has been the most frustrating part of his presidency."}, {"title": "The Ojibwe Take A Stand For Treaty Rights, Hoping To Defeat A Pipeline", "text": "About 40 members of several Ojibwe communities in Minnesota staged a protest this week over their right to hunt, fish and harvest wild rice off the reservation, seeking to provoke a peaceful confrontation with law enforcement.The protesters, who have organized themselves as the 1855 Treaty Authority, intentionally violated Minnesota state laws and regulations that prohibit the Ojibwe from harvesting wild rice off-reservation. The protest on Thursday and Friday took place on Hole-in-the-Day Lake and Gull Lake, near Nisswa in central Minnesota.The 1855 Treaty Authority argues that the state laws violate rights that the Ojibwe were guaranteed under treaties signed between the tribe and the U.S. government in the 1800s. Those treaties ceded Ojibwe lands to the United States, but protected the Natives’ rights to hunt, fish and gather off the reservation, the group claims.The protest tactic is reminiscent of “fish-ins” that the late Nisqually tribal member Billy Frank Jr. led in the Pacific Northwest during the 1960s and ‘70s. Those fish-ins deliberately violated state laws against Native fishing in order to re-assert rights stipulated in treaties signed between Indian nations and the U.S. They led to the decriminalization of Native fisheries and the legal protection of treaty rights to fish in Washington state, now overseen by the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission.The showdown in Minnesota was originally slated for Thursday, but was temporarily defused when the state Department of Natural Resources issued an unrequested special one-day permit allowing the band members to harvest wild rice.Normal enforcement practices resumed Friday, and the Department of Natural Resources cited Todd Thompson of the White Earth band and Jim Northrup of the Fond du Lac band for “taking fish by illegal methods” on Gull Lake, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Thompson and Northrup used a traditional Ojibwe gillnet to fish on Gull Lake, where netting fish is illegal.Col. Ken Soring of the Department of Natural Resources told The Huffington Post that the Ojibwe fishermen face “gross misdemeanor charges for gillnetting.” In addition, Soring said, his department cited two unnamed wild rice harvesters who could also face misdemeanor charges, which would likely result in fines or the loss of state hunting and fishing rights.“The DNR does not recognize reservation harvest rights in the 1855 treaty,” Soring said. “We welcome harvest, but it would be under state licensing and state laws.”The protesters have vowed to continue harvesting wild rice against state laws to provoke further confrontation with law enforcement. The 1855 Treaty Authority has said they will challenge the citations and fight for Ojibwe treaty rights in court.“It’s all about having our treaty rights recognized finally and completely and forever,” said Frank Bibeau, an attorney representing the 1855 Treaty Authority. “The state of Minnesota is without power over our treaty rights.”Bibeau said he is confident that treaties between the U.S. and the Ojibwe, as well as prior case law, set the precedent for the White Earth and other bands to re-assert rights to hunt, fish and gather.The lawyer and others affiliated with the tribe want to push their case even further, however, asserting their treaty rights as a means of stopping oil and gas pipelines. The proposed route of the Sandpiper project, part of an aggressive expansion of pipelines in the region by Canadian oil company Enbridge, runs near the White Earth Nation, while the older Minnesota Pipe Line already crosses the area. Some Ojibwe worry that these pipelines could permanently pollute the land, water and food that has sustained their people for generations.“What we want to do ultimately, beyond the rights to hunt, fish and gather, is really to protect our environment,” said Bibeau. “We are facing four different kinds of pipeline projects right now through Northern Minnesota, through the lakes, rivers and even the headwaters of the Mississippi.”“Our responsibility as the people here is to take care of that land and to take care of that rice and to take care of everything the Creator gave us,” said Winona LaDuke, a White Earth tribal member and two-time Green Party vice presidential candidate. “The issue is, how are you going to be able to eat your rice if there’s oil in it?”"}, {"title": "Trash-Filled Streets Show Why Lebanon Is Telling Its Politicians 'You Stink'", "text": "Beirut stinks, and the city's residents are not happy about it.Trash has been piling up in the streets of the Lebanese capital and surrounding areas for several weeks.

Solar energy isn't just limited to the US; it has now become a global standard. Increasing worries about climate change have compelled many to relook at the role of solar energy. It's not just sustainable, but also renewable like wind and biomass, which means there will always be enough of it to go around.However, with so much information on solar energy systems and companies, installation, cost and companies, it can be difficult to know how to get started. This article gives a step-by-step overview on solar energy companies, the associated cost and types of solar energy systems.Step 1: Research Solar Energy Companies  Solar energy has become a workable option in new home construction and renovation. In fact, solar energy has become big business globally. Solar investments grew 25% to 149.6 billion in 2014. The solar energy market is expected to grow 16% to 25% in 2015. Businesses and government entities are looking to become more sustainable and as a result, they are turning solar to operate their systems.Some of the best US solar energy companies today are installing systems without having customers pay for energy generated by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Location as well as type of solar energy system that is needed and for what use is important. Another thing to notice is whether the company is getting the attention of investors. This shows some degree of profitability.When researching solar energy companies, keep in mind the following:• Not all solar energy companies support residential projects. Residential is the smallest market. In 2014, only 20% of U.S. installations were residential projects.  • The U.S. investment tax credit (the largest solar subsidy in the U.S.) is due to expire at the end of 2016. Now could be a good time for homeowners and future homebuyers to install solar panels while still benefiting from federal and local tax incentives.• Good news! The cost of solar energy is decreasing significantly, and some of the best US solar energy companies are offering competitive rates. Residential system costs are down 50% to $3.48/watt while commercial costs are down 65% to $2.25/watt. This is good news for businesses and homebuyers who want to profit from investing in solar energy.Once you've identified the market and need for a solar energy system, the next step for any aspiring investor, business or homeowner is to research the cost of solar energy. Bottom line -- How much are you willing to pay to install solar panels?Cost of Solar Energy - Power System CostAlthough the initial cost for installation, permits and equipment are high and its cost may seem pricey, the real value and investment is cost efficiency in total home cost and monthly utility bills. According to Find Solar Power, solar energy costs can range from $15,000 up to $29,000 and the initial purchase can be \"offset by the available tax credits in your state as well as any from the federal government and made possible through leasing and financing options.\" The third and final step is to identify the solar energy system that best suits the needs for your residential or commercial use.Identify the Solar Energy System for Your NeedsWhen paying for the installation of solar panels, you're actually covering the cost of a solar energy system for either residential or commercial use. The key is to identify which one best matches your needs and in some cases, homeowners may need both systems. With the Solar Thermal System, solar panels gather sunlight that transforms into energy during daylight hours for heating water systems. The solar energy that is gathered from the Photovoltaic System converts energy into electricity that is needed for operating many appliances and systems in your home.  As you can see, there's quite a few elements that need to be taken into consideration when choosing solar over another energy source. Decreasing costs, tax incentives and environmental benefits and are good reasons to invest in solar power."}, {"title": "'This Could Be The Rarest Animal In The World'", "text": "Truly a mystery of the deep, this living fossil hasn't been seen by scientists in more than three decades. Until now.Peter Ward, a biologist at the University of Washington, first spotted the Allonautilus scrobiculatus   in 1984 alongside his colleague Bruce Saunders. The hairy animal looked fairly similar to the better known Nautilus pompilius,  but proved to be an entirely new, and elusive, genus of nautilus. But the creature vanished, and Ward didn't spot another for more than 30 years.But earlier this month, Ward ventured to Papua New Guinea to hunt for the cephalopod again. Aside from the creature's evasiveness, the scientist said, the schematics of the research were complicated: long days, the threat of malaria and temperatures \"so hot it was almost impossible to think.\"Ward's crew had to jump between several locations where locals were certain Allonautilus would be found, but his team kept turning up empty-handed. They'd set up a \"bait on a stick\" system every night, hoping to attract the nautiluses, which live some 500 to 1,300 feet below the surface.Until finally, there it was, swimming alongside a cousin in all its slimy glory.The find is a substantial addition in the field of biological diversity. Nautilus pompilius,  the enigmatic red and white nautilus seen above, is one of the oldest species around, often classified as a \"living fossil.\" But its furry cousin has a substantially different anatomy, and Ward said the genus is probably a million years old or less.\"This is kind of like a holy grail, at least in what I do,\" Ward told The Huffington Post. \"It takes a lot of push to put anything in a wholly new and different genus ... [and] this is one of the newest animals on the planet.\"Sadly, their elusiveness is tied to growing threats also linked to the collapse of various fisheries around the globe. Nautiluses are highly sought for their striking shells, and overfishing has slashed populations.Ward said researchers are preparing to propose the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service add it to the the list of protected species guarded by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. International protection could very well help ensure the Allonautilus  doesn't fade into obscurity once again.“This could be the rarest animal in the world,\" Ward told UW Today. \"We need to know if Allonautilus is anywhere else, and we won’t know until we go out there and look.”"}, {"title": "In Kenya, Proposed Coal-Fired Power Plant Threatens World Heritage Site", "text": "In 2015, only about 23 percent of Kenya's 45,500,000 people have access to electricity, and this problem is particularly pronounced in rural areas of the East African country, where electrification drops to a staggering 4 percent. It's clear that the question is not whether or not something needs to be done -- it is unconscionable to leave people living in energy poverty. Rather, the issue is how do we start delivering energy services as quickly and as broadly as possible?Despite mounting evidence that new coal generation regularly fails to deliver energy access, especially in rural areas, Amu Power is proposing a 1,000 megawatt coal plant in Manda Bay in Lamu County, home to the World Heritage listed Lamu Old Town. Oxfam and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) recently issued a report on energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa showing that off-grid and mini-grid technologies are better at delivering power than centralized projects like coal plants. These small scale projects, such as home solar systems and community renewable energy, can cost effectively generate power where it is needed and can be installed now instead of waiting years or decades for grid extensions.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to reach \"energy for all,\" 64 percent of new energy investments must go to off-grid and mini-grid solutions. This has been backed up by the World Bank, which warned of the devastating health effects caused by coal-generated energy, saying that coal is not the solution to the world's energy access needs. The most persuasive argument perhaps was the former secretary of India's ministry of power, EAS Sarma, who in an opinion piece for The Guardian noted that his country has added 95,000 megawatts of largely coal-fired power since 2001, but it has done little to help the 45 percent of rural households living without access to electricity. Meanwhile, unsafe levels of mercury and other pollutants are already impacting the health of pregnant women and children who live near India's coal plants. In fact, pollution from coal causes over 100,000 deaths every year in India. But instead of actually helping alleviate energy poverty, the electricity is gobbled up by existing, more affluent users.As for impoverished urban residents with access to the grid, many cannot afford to pay for energy or have other technical barriers to access. This is particularly relevant in Kenya where the cost of grid-based power and connections is a major factor behind energy poverty. The truth is that building coal plants is expensive and often plagued with long delays and cost overruns, as we have seen in South Africa where the Medupi and Kusile coal plants. These two projects are at least four years behind schedule and $6 billion and $7 billion over budget respectively. This is not a good precedent for the Lamu coal plant, which is already facing delays.And where coal fails at alleviating energy poverty, it succeeds in spreading deadly pollution. It is this concern over the health effects of coal that spurred locals in Lamu to action, starting with a petition calling on Lamu Governor Issa Timamy to stop the coal project. While project proponents insist this will be a \"clean coal\" plant, saying \"the only thing that comes out of the chimney is water vapor,\" the truth is there is no such thing as \"clean coal.\" The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has yet to be released, but we can glean some details about the project from statements and interviews given by project spokespeople. For example, the proposed Lamu plant does not employ the best available technology to limit pollution, and it will begin operation without Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce nitrogen oxides. The operator says they will add an SCR later, but the time to add an SCR is during construction, not after emitting pollutants for an indefinite amount of time. And while the project will have controls for particulates and sulfur, there are no controls that can capture every emission, resulting in untold tons of deadly sulfur, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter spewed into the air. The proposal also states the plant will employ supercritical technology, which is hardly advanced at a time when more efficient ultra-supercritical plants are being built -- and even those are still far from clean.With regards to water pollution, the ash dump for the toxic leftovers that remain after the coal is burned will be lined, but a single layer of high density polythene paper is not sufficient, and without leak detection dangerous heavy metals could still contaminate nearby waters. It is also unclear whether there is a plan for catastrophic failure of the ash dump, as happened in Tennessee and North Carolina. It is also unclear what sort of cooling system the plant will use. Chemicals discharged from coal plants into the water can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and fishing, especially if the plant has an open cycle cooling system which releases water at a temperature significantly above that of local bodies.There are still many questions surrounding the proposed Lamu coal plant, but perhaps none is more critical than the question of whether the plant it is even necessary. With the cost of clean energy sources dropping -- even to the point of making them cheaper than coal in places -- and knowing that coal is not an effective solution to alleviate energy poverty, is building a new coal plant that will force locals to live with deadly pollution really the best option for Lamu? For those organized against the project, the answer is clearly no."}, {"title": "Pit Bull With Half A Face Gets New Nose, Helps Other Abuse Victims", "text": "The damage inflicted on Khalessi the pit bull by her previous owners is, finally, being undone.The sweet dog who lost half her face -- including her nose and jaw, as well as full use of her back legs -- to abuse, has been through her first round of reconstructive surgery.This week, veterinarians at the Hays Towne Veterinary Hospital in Southwest Florida built Khalessi a new nose, removing her tusk-like upper canine teeth in the process.Surgeon Colby Burns explained to WFLA that the procedure would involve \"creating two openings so she has a nasal passage,\" while making the new nose out of tissue from elsewhere on Khalessi's face.On Thursday night, after the five-hour surgery, veterinarian Kerry Slomcenski posted to Facebook that Khalessi was \"sleeping comfortably\" -- for the first time in a while.\"She has not been able to do this in a very long time because her tongue used to block her airway when she tried to sleep,\" Slomcenski wrote.Stephanie Paquin -- founder of the nonprofit Passion 4 Pits, who has been caring for Khalessi since getting her out of a Florida shelter about two weeks ago -- is breathing a little easier, too.Khalessi is far from done with her treatment and will remain hospitalized for another week, Paquin told The Huffington Post.\"She is going to need surgery to repair her legs as well,\" she said.But even now, while she's in the thick of getting better herself, Khalessi is helping others of her kind.For one, folks are signing up to take foster dogs into their homes as a result of learning about Khaleesi. This is letting Passion 4 Pits get more dogs out of the shelter. The foster-based group needs its dogs to have a safe place to stay while being treated and readied for adoption.And even those who aren't able to house a doggie for some time have been looking for other ways to contribute, for example, financially.For those: Paquin has set up Khalessi's Warriors Foundation, the proceeds of which will be used to take care of dogs who are victims of cruelty and abuse.Because of all this support, Paquin was able to save a new dog, named Trooper. He is a loving, friendly dog with wounds all over his legs, who came from the same shelter as where Khalessi wound up, and then got out of.Trooper is now also in the hospital, being made well.It's likely a long road ahead of him, too. But a much more hopeful one than had he been left behind.Paquin chalks Trooper's rescue up to Khalessi.She's excited to see what else lies ahead for this special dog, and because of her.\"This amazing little girl has brought people together from every corner of the world and she has forever changed my life and the rescue,\" Paquin says. \"I feel very blessed that she came into our lives.\"We've reached out to the Orange County Sheriff's Office for information about the investigation into Khalessi's abuse, and will update this piece with any new information.Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you have an animal story to share!CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this piece, an explanation of the surgery provided by Dr. Colby Burns was mistakenly attributed to Dr. Kerri Slomcenski."}, {"title": "POTUS and Climate Change: Four Steps Forward,  One Step Back, but Still Missing a KEY Step", "text": "Barack Obama is about to leave on a historic journey that could affect Americans for generations to come - he'll become the first sitting American President to visit the Arctic to observe Alaska's rapidly melting glaciers. This trip, coming on the heels of Obama's historic clean energy plan is groundbreaking. Also poignant as it will coincide with the ten-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina which signaled the arrival of climate change on U.S. shores-- whether Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal wants the president to talk about it in New Orleans or not.On August 13th, our Commander-in-Chief took time out from his vacation to announce the Arctic trip, declaring, \"What's happening in Alaska isn't just a preview of what will happen to the rest of us if we don't take action. It's our wake-up call -- the alarm bells are ringing. And as long as I'm President, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late.\"The Obama administration's Council on Environmental Quality even hosted a panel discussion on August 20th about what's being done on college campuses to educate youth about the climate crisis. This is a step in a very positive direction. However the president can't get an \"A\" in my book until his administration does something to address the eco-education gap among adults.This week President Obama addressed the Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas. He sounded like a true advocate in declaring, \"Solar isn't just for the green crowd anymore--it's for the green eyeshade crowd, too!\" in praising recent cost reductions for renewable energy.However, Obama's decision, announced last week, to grant Shell Oil the rights to drill in the Arctic seemed to fly in the face of his earlier news and left climate activists scratching their heads. Is the Obama administration trying to pull a fast one --a Shell game-- or what? That's not yet clear, and the timing is particularly puzzling since his drilling decision so closely precedes the fact-finding, glacier-gazing trip to Alaska.Given the latest data showing Greenland's glaciers melting at a dizzying rate of three feet per hour, this journey comes none too soon. Not to mention that July was the hottest month EVER recorded and 2015 is set to melt records.Yet the green light given to Shell, especially after the oil giant botched its first attempts to drill in the pristine region, seems oddly timed. What is clear is it's too soon to uncork the champagne in celebration. Better keep it on ice until after Obama sees the melting icebergs, drills down, and connects some more green dots.I put some bubbly in the fridge to chill after the President's August 3rd Clean Power Plan announcement. Comments like \"...no challenge poses a greater threat to our future and future generations than a changing climate,\" \"There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change,\" and \"We only get one home, one planet,\" and \"There's no plan B\" showed that Obama understands the importance of this crisis, and also its immediacy.What rocked my world most about Obama's announcement was that CNN carried it live. Millions around the country and world got the full impact in real time - similar to the Pope's pivotal encyclical on climate change. Getting the mainstream news to report on growing threats from a changing climate and other eco-existential challenges is paramount. It's been a commitment of mine for more than a decade to bring this to fruition.As a former CBS Radio reporter and anchor who left breaking news to cover our breaking planet and emerging eco-evolution as an independent radio host/producer, I can attest to the fact that there is zero programming on any commercial broadcast network - radio OR television - that covers these critical environmental changes.I call this astonishing media void the \"glaring green gap\" and have been trying to fill it for more than a decade. After producing and hosting more than 2,500 shows on the former Air America network (left of center) between 2004-2007 and later independently on the internet, archived at www.thegreenfront.com and www.ecotalkradio.com, I have experienced first hand how much there is to learn and report on, both in terms of challenges...and solutions.There are at least \"50 Shades of Green\" both in range of topics (from garbage to GMO's to global warming) and \"E\"-list guests. Eco-leaders like Al Gore, Robert Kennedy Jr., Van Jones, climate scientists including Dr. Jim Hansen and Dr. Katherine Hayhoe, writers Francis Moore Lappe and Elizabeth Kolbert, and Senators John Kerry, Barbara Boxer, Bernie Sanders have all been interviewed on my programs, but they represent just a tip of the melting iceberg when it comes to credible and compelling voices for our embattled environment. Passionate experts on these topics must be heard by the masses in order to broaden our understanding, widen the conversation and prompt restorative action.It's worth noting that not one of the questioners or candidates in the August 6 Fox News Channel \"prime-time\" GOP presidential debate mentioned the climate crisis, energy or the environment, other than Jeb Bush taking a jab at opponents to the Keystone pipeline. And just ahead of the President's visit to New Orleans Thursday Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal warned against linking Katrina to climate change.Keep in mind that Jeb Bush's low-lying State of Florida is predicted to be the first U.S. casualty of rising sea levels. No one who watched the debate heard any discussion about the need to scale back our carbon emissions to 350 parts per million.Just imagine how many millions would get a critical education and quick wake-up call on our shared eco-reality if the TLC network replaced its cancelled hit reality show \"19 Kids and Counting\" with a program called \"400 Parts Per Million and Rising.\" Now that might get America to wake up and smell the carbon!"}, {"title": "Here's Why Scientists Are Giving Honeybees Tiny 'Backpacks'", "text": "These tiny \"backpacks\" aren't your typical fashion accessory.An international research team, leading the Global Initiative for Honeybee Health, is addressing the global decline of honeybee populations by equipping the insects with tiny high-tech backpacks.A video posted to YouTube Monday shows the backpacks, which are actually micro-sensors, in action. They use radio-frequency identification technology, which enables electronic readers to record the behavior of individual bees. That recorded data is then sent to a computer for the researchers to review.About 15,000 healthy honeybees in Australia and Brazil have been given these high-tech backpacks, which weigh just 5.4 milligrams, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.\"The tiny technology allows researchers to analyze the effects of stress factors including disease, pesticides, air pollution, water contamination, diet and extreme weather on the movements of bees and their ability to pollinate,\" Dr. Paulo de Souza, a science leader with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which organized the initiative, said in a press release. \"We’re also investigating what key factors, or combination of factors, lead to bee deaths en masse.\"Nearly one-third of all honeybee colonies in the U.S. have vanished, according to the Natural Defense Resource Council. The global honeybee population is declining so quickly that it's resulting in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder, de Souza told the BBC. This is when the majority of worker bees in a colony die or abandon the hive, and only the queen, honey and immature bees remain. Scientists don't know why this happens.\"Fitting so many bees with chips allows us to have a representative measure of hive activity,\" de Souza told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Also, we tag young bees and they carry sensors during their entire lifespan.\"Now, all eyes will be on the backpack-carrying honeybees as the researchers hope to find clues to explain dwindling bee populations and the disappearance of beehives.\"The time is now for a tightly-focused, well-coordinated national and international effort, using the same shared technology and research protocols, to help solve the problems facing honey bees worldwide before it is too late,\" de Souza said.Check out photos of the bees sporting their backpacks below."}, {"title": "What Eating Organic Food Does for the World", "text": "by guest blogger Lisa Bunin, PhD, organic policy director, Center for Food SafetySure, I eat organic food because I think it's healthier for me than food grown with synthetic, toxic agrochemicals or food that's been genetically engineered or injected with growth hormones. But equally important to me are the multiple ecosystem services and broader benefits for society that organic farming provides.For starters, when you eat organic, you support a system of food production that taps into the very best of what nature has to offer. You eschew farming practices that aim to overpower nature's complex ecological systems by taming them with artificial chemicals. You reject the growing of a single crop on sterile land bereft of vegetation that extends for miles. And you sustain organic farmers and farming practices that enrich nature's ecology by producing strong plants that resist pests and disease and produce healthy and delicious food.Nourishing SoilsWhen you eat organic, you endorse farming systems designed to maintain and improve the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of soil. Organic farmers manage crop nutrients and soil fertility through the application of organic matter and compost, as the organic regulations require. They plant cover crops for weed suppression, to increase earthworms and beneficial microorganisms in the soil, and to add essential plant nutrients that assist in plant growth and seed and fruit production. These practices also mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by improving soil's water-holding capacity and regulating soil temperatures so that crops can survive during droughts, floods, and bouts of extreme heat or cold.Flourishing EnvironmentsWhen you eat organic, you contribute to conserving water, protecting biological diversity, and defending wildlife, wild nature, and pollinators like bees, and butterflies. Standard organic farming practices such as planting high residue cover and rotational crops, like oats and hay, create large volumes of plant biomass that increase the amount of carbon stored (sequestered) in soils. These practices also prevent erosion and topsoil loss. Planting native hedgerows creates wildlife habitats and attracts pollinators, beneficial insects, and birds that fertilize crops and combat pests. Hedgerows have the added benefit of filtering waterborne pathogens in their root systems, filtering windborne pathogens on their vegetation, and regulating water flow to crops.Healthy Workers and CommunitiesWhen you eat organic, you also champion a healthier environment for those who grow your food. That's not to say that farm work, organic or not, is easy. But a farm is certainly a healthier place for farmers to work when they are not exposed to synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides as they labor. Growing organic is also healthier for farming families and the communities where food is grown because those major sources of hazardous air and soilborne farm chemicals are largely eliminated. So are the accompanying social costs of ill health, reproductive disorders, and compromised immune systems. Since antibiotics and non-naturally occurring growth hormones are prohibited in organic animal rearing, organically raised animals receive more ethical treatment. Humans benefit, too, from not eating meat injected with drugs.With all of the societal advantages of organic food production systems, it's not surprising--and it's certainly justifiable--that organic farmers get paid a premium price for the food they grow. After all, they use their labor, ingenuity, experiential knowledge, and instincts to maintain crop yields, instead of relying on quick toxic chemical fixes or unproven genetic engineering technology. They produce healthy food that's good for the planet and all of its inhabitants, and they deserve to get paid a fair price for it.So, when you eat organic, you can feel confident that you are contributing to a better world by supporting farmers and farming practices that steward the fertile land upon which a secure food future depends. What's more, you help ensure that current and future generations of farmers can continue to provide themselves, their communities, and the world with healthy and nutritious, fresh food.Given all of these benefits of eating organic, I have to agree with the take-home message of Maria Rodale's book Organic Manifesto: \"If you do just one thing--make one conscious choice--that can change the world, go organic. Buy organic food. Stop using chemicals and start supporting organic farmers. No other single choice you can make to improve the health of your family and the planet will have greater positive repercussions for our future.\"Watch the video! \"The Choice Is Simple: Choose Organic.\"As organic policy director with the national public interest organization Center for Food Safety, Lisa J. Bunin's work focuses on curbing the proliferation of harmful food-production technologies by promoting organic and sustainable agriculture and by challenging policies and practices that compromise organic integrity. Bunin holds a PhD in environmental sociology and is board president of the Ecological Farming Association. She also serves on the National Organic Coalition's executive committee.

Instead, it could lose tropical storm strength over the next two days, with winds falling below 40 mph (64 kph) as it moves over eastern Cuba, though heavy rain was still a concern.\"The forecast intensity has been significantly changed to show a much weaker cyclone,\" the hurricane center said in a late Friday afternoon advisory.If Erika survives the mountains, it could regain intensity over the Straits of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, it added.\"We're not quite prepared to rule out tropical storm impacts in Florida,\" the NHC said.Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Friday, noting the storm could travel \"up the spine of Florida\" from Sunday into next week.Scott said the Tampa area on Florida's Gulf Coast was a major flood concern due to saturation from rain this month.Forecasters have described Erika, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, as unusually hard to predict due to disruption from wind patterns and interaction with land, which weakens a storm, as well as warm water, which adds energy.The greatest risk over the next few days was heavy rain over impoverished Haiti's eroded hillsides, with up to 10 inches (25 cm) possible in some areas. This could cause \"life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,\" the Miami-based NHC said.As Erika neared Haiti on Friday, its sustained winds were still holding at 50 mph (80 kph), the NHC said.So far the worst affected island was Dominica in the eastern Caribbean where the prime minister said in a radio broadcast that swollen rivers and rain-triggered landslides had swept away homes, roads and bridges. Some communities were cut off on the small, mountainous island with a population of about 72,000.Skerrit lowered the number of confirmed fatalities from 12 to eight in a Twitter post.

You noticed the media forgot all about another story's basic facts? Tweet @TheWorldPost or let us know on our Facebook page.The worst drought in almost a decade has decimated agriculture in southern Africa, leaving 1 in 10 people in the region at risk of going hungry.The drought contributed to massive crop failures, including in South Africa which ordinarily produces 40 percent of the region's corn. The country had to import the crop earlier this year, after it faced the worst drought since 1992.The regional drought crisis has raised fears of renewed chaos in Zimbabwe, just as it was beginning to emerge from years of economic turmoil. The World Food Program warned this week that 1.5 million Zimbabweans will face food shortages after the production of staple crops like corn was slashed by around 50 percent.“What you will see is people buying less of everything else so that they can afford corn,” Zimbabwe-based economist John Robertson told Bloomberg News. “People will limit buying to corn and nothing else.”Zimbabwean officials said over 20,000 people have fled drought-hit regions for more fertile areas, sparking conflict and hurting the region’s ecosystem. The government warns that rainfall in Zimbabwe could decline by between 5 and 20 percent by 2050.Zimbabwe came close to economic collapse after 2000, in part because of 91-year-old President Robert Mugabe's land reform policies, according to analysts. But after years marked by recession, widespread food shortages, and hyperinflation that reached a billion percent, the country experienced modest economic growth in recent years. Food output rose by 82 percent in 2013-2014 from the previous year.Now these gains risk being wiped out by the drought and other negative factors, including lower commodity prices. Zimbabwe cut its economic growth forecast from 3.2 percent to 1.5 percent last month.“Everyone is very much dreading a return to 2008, which was the era of meltdown and hyperinflation,” Stephen Chan, international relations professor at the U.K.’s School of Oriental and African Studies, told The Guardian after a recent trip to Zimbabwe. Chan explained that while hyperinflation is unlikely to return now that Zimbabwe is using the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies, there is mounting pressure on Mugabe to attract more investment and tackle’s the country’s debt.Yet experts warn of more drought and food shortages across southern Africa, as climate change disrupts rainfall and temperature patterns. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last year that climate change has already had a negative impact on agriculture around the world.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Hottest...July...Evah!", "text": "July was hot. It was the hottest July on record, but more than this: it was the warmest month ever recorded on Earth. Let that sink in a moment. The first seven months of 2015 were all record breakers, and 2015 is on track to take the record for warmest recorded year. As Paris Hilton likes to say, \"That's hot.\"Data show that the global average surface temperature in July was 61.86F, breaking the 1998 record by 0.14 degrees.Nineteen ninety-eight was the year of the last huge El Niño event, and most forecasts predict a similarly large event this year. El Niños tend to raise worldwide temperatures, and also to create mischief in places like California, parts of which haven't received rain in a very long time. El Niño rains in California often double the normal annual rainfall -- all falling in a few weeks, with storm after soupy storm drenching the state. This deluge leads to landslides. The gigantic Mission Peak Landslide above Fremont initiated after the 1998 El Niño rains, and the slide has been awaiting the next deluge to move downhill toward a number of homes. Epic drought or unmanageable rainfall -- California just can't seem to catch a break.But the bad news for California just keeps coming: NASA reports that the ground in parts of the state is sinking as rapidly as two inches per month. No, I didn't mistype that: two inches per month. With the ground plunging on the order of two feet per year, soon roads and home foundations and infrastructure, such as the California Aqueduct, will start to crack and deform.This ground sinking -- also known as subsidence -- happens when farmers pump water out of aquifers to irrigate their crops. That formerly-trapped underground water acted as an incompressible fluid to support deeply-buried sediment layers from the crushing weight of everything on top of them. Remove that water and you remove the support for those layers. Imagine poking a hole in a waterbed then having a bunch of people jump on the mattress.Normally, farmers receive an allotment of irrigation water, but California's epic drought has so curtailed these water deliveries that the agricultural industry increasingly relies on groundwater pumping. The state has not traditionally regulated or even measured this sort of pumping (and you thought California regulated everything!). Now so much water is being pumped that subsidence is happening at a staggering rate.Record-breaking temperatures. El Niño storms and landslides. Epic drought. Rapid land subsidence. California has always been a land with plenty of drama, but human activities are making the Golden State even more extreme.According to a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, anthropogenic climate change has made the current California drought 15-20% worse than it would otherwise have been. Periods of drought and intense rain have long characterized California's hydrology, but now it's as if the craziness has been turned up to 11. Moreover, as the Geophysical Research Letters article found, climate change is doubling the risk of California droughts as severe as the current one.We can't do anything about some problems afflicting the planet, such as the Kardashians still having a reality TV show. But climate problems we bring on ourselves."}, {"title": "Ten Years After Katrina, Low-Income Communities Are Still Vulnerable to Disaster: Here's Why", "text": "Gloria Walton, photo courtesy of SCOPEIt's been 10 years since my mother lost the only house she's ever owned.A warehouse worker in Jackson, Mississippi, one of the poorest American cities, my mother lost her house to the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina that uprooted families, killed thousands and laid waste to entire neighborhoods throughout the Gulf States.My mother earned less than $11 an hour. She didn't have the means to fix the house after the water receded and mold spread through it like a mile-a-minute weed, so she lost the house to foreclosure.She had lived in it for only two years.On Aug. 29, it will be 10 years since the deadly storm that pushed families already living on the brink over the edge. My mom, like so many others, is still recovering.Hurricane Katrina survivors wade through water on the street on Aug. 31, 2005, two days after the storm made land fall.  Photo Credit: News Muse, flickrDespite the losses - Katrina was the worst residential disaster in U.S. history costing $135 billion in damage - we as a nation haven't done much to prepare the most vulnerable of our communities for disaster. Today, I see another disaster striking low income communities. I see the devastation that the four-year drought in California is having on families already struggling to get by as it parches the land, displaces people and drives out jobs.Like Katrina, where impoverished communities such as the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans were wiped away by the storm, in California the people hardest hit are those who live in communities that have experienced disinvestment.\"The people with the fewest resources to begin with have the hardest times rebounding,\" says Heather Joy Rosenberg, a US Green Building Council Ginsberg Fellow.The California drought is highlighting the differences between the haves and have-nots in the nation's most populous state. There is a tension between water as a human right and as a commodity that has existed throughout the state's history, but that we feel acutely during droughts. Today in California, if you can afford to pay for water, you can have lots of it.Nowhere are the stark differences more apparent than in two radically different communities south of Los Angeles. In Cowan Heights, a wealthy community, property owners who can afford their water bills have kept their lawns lush and green during the drought. Residents there consumed 572.4 gallons of water per person during the hottest months last year, from July to September.Thirty miles away in Compton, families that are in a daily struggle to make ends meet limit their water use for the basic necessities of life, including bathing and cooking. Lawns, not surprisingly, are dull and brown. Compton used 63.6 gallons of water per person during the summer last year.The state is rationing the amount of water Californians use, calling for four to 36% cuts by community. Steep rises in water rates are likely to follow.But in south Los Angeles, where I work and a third of the residents live in extreme poverty, residents can't afford high water bills. They are like many American households in the bottom 40% of incomes, which spend about 15% of their average $18,000 a year incomes on utilities. For decades, the people in these communities have lived figuratively with drought, from a lack of green space and trees to food deserts.Now they face a literal drought if they cannot pay for water.We must begin to think smartly about how to prepare vulnerable communities for the effects of climate change so they can sustain themselves. For example, we should plant more trees in communities where parks are scarce to keep neighborhoods cooler as temperatures rise. Then under those open spaces, we can construct aquifers to capture storm water. In Los Angeles, when it rains, the runoff flows into the Los Angeles River, which carries it to the ocean.We need to rethink our water infrastructure so we keep every drop we get. Why not help low income communities find ways to capture water so they can use it where they need it most?And as we think about ways to create more sustainable communities, we need to think about jobs and who will do the work.At Strategic Concepts for Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE), the organization I lead, we've tried this approach to help families cut their bills. For example, we've worked with partners who have trained people from the community to install solar panels, which have been placed in the homes of low-income families. Solar power can save California households more than $30,000 over 20 years. Something similar needs to happen with water.The 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the ongoing drought in California shine a spotlight on the extreme weather we will continue to see as a result of climate change. Americans often talk about Katrina and New Orleans as if they are synonymous, but the devastation was felt for hundreds of miles in communities where people have less resources to rebuild and rebound.This is a wake-up call that we must prepare those communities that are the most vulnerable, whether they are in Jackson, Mississippi, the Lower 9th Ward or South Los Angeles.Gloria Walton is President and CEO of Strategic Concepts for Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE), which builds grassroots power to create economic and social justice in low-income communities of color.

Before today's rule, 2 million miles of streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which flow into our favorite waterways, from the Puget Sound to the Chesapeake Bay, had lacked clear safeguards under the Clean Water Act, following a pair of polluter driven lawsuits that went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006.Court decisions in these two cases had left the streams and wetlands that feed our rivers, lakes, and the drinking water supplies for 1 in 3 Americans vulnerable to polluters and developers, who could use these waters as dumping grounds or pave over them without any federal oversight or limits. In fact, in a four-year period following the decisions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had to drop more than 1500 investigations against polluters, according to one analysis by The New York Times. Similarly, an investigation by Pro Publica found oil companies and other polluters dumping into streams without consequence.The Clean Water Rule, adopted in May following a decade-long push by Environment America and many others, ensures that such pollution cases can be prosecuted. On the front end, federal officials can now protect these waters with enforceable limits on pollution.The joint rule by EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is backed by robust scientific review and has gained broad support across a wide range of constituencies, including mayors, brewers, kayakers, anglers, small businesses, and small farmers.The public strongly backs the rule. In May a Hart Research Associates poll showed that 80 percent of voters surveyed across party lines favored it. Americans submitted more than 800,000 comments in support of the restored protections.Despite the public's backing of the Clean Water Rule, oil and gas companies, developers, and other polluters have waged a bitter campaign against it. Congress has largely sided with the polluters, with the U.S. House and key Senate committees passing bills to undo the restored protections.Moreover, polluters and their allies have turned once again to the courts. Those bringing lawsuits against the Clean Water Rule now include Murray Energy (the largest privately held coal company in the U.S.), agribusiness interests, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and several state attorneys general.Yesterday, a federal judge in North Dakota granted a motion to halt the rule in 13 states pending the outcome of litigation by their attorneys general. It's frustrating to see clean water delayed and denied to the people of these (mostly Western) states, including Colorado and New Mexico.Yet we know that the Clean Water Rule is on solid legal ground and backed by more than 1,000 scientific studies showing how streams and wetlands are vital to the health of our rivers, lakes, and bays.And so, with enough support from key senators and continued strong backing from the Obama administration, we're confident that the restored protections for our streams and rivers will survive and thrive. That way, our favorite places for swimming, boating, and fishing will be cleaner today, this weekend, and for many summers to come."}, {"title": "10 Years Later, Pit Bull Rescued During Katrina Finally Has A Forever Home", "text": "A few weeks after Hurricane Katrina, veterinarian Jennifer Wellman was volunteering at a camp set up to care for displaced pets, many of whom were sick and starving.Pinky came in -- a sunburned pit bull with a bad skin condition and a sweet disposition, and nowhere to go.\"I wasn't really planning on bringing animals back,\" Wellman says. But she couldn't bear to leave Pinky behind.Wellman (her last name was then Stobbe; that's how she's identified in the video) wound up coming home to her practice in Mississippi with three Katrina pit bulls in tow, Pinky among them, figuring she'd get them healthy and socialized, and then into homes.Half a decade later, Pinky was still there.Wellman had by then opened a pet resort, to go with her animal hospital. Pinky lived there, and was happy and comfortable.He and another of the dogs, who also hadn't yet been adopted, had \"a pretty darn good quality of life,\" says Wellman.But she still hoped that they'd find families to love them.To increase their odds, Pinky and the other pup were dispatched to a progressive shelter in Colorado, where the climes seemed friendlier to pit bull adoption.The two dogs were given lots of training and love at the Colorado shelter. It worked for Pinky's friend, who got adopted.Pinky was given a new name more fitting to the now older, no longer sunburned dog: Yogi.But even with the new name and the new environment, Yogi still wasn't getting adopted. He's not great with other dogs and has lingering health issues, plus a patchy coat -- which might all have contributed.Yogi began showing some signs of stress in the shelter. The options for a dog in this situation can often be grim.His shelter caregivers wanted to see a happier ending, and submitted an application for Yogi to go live at the Best Friends Animal Society sanctuary in Utah.Yogi got to the sanctuary in July 2012.The aim was still to find him a home. But if needed, Yogi could stay the rest of his life in this place -- where on any given day he'd go for long walks and take golf cart rides around the sanctuary, palling around with staff and volunteers.\"Yogi was always very happy here,\" says Cherie Mascis, a manager at Best Friends. \"He has never had a home so we don't know if he knew what he was missing.\"Ingrid Lindberg and her partner, Melinda Miles, are dog lovers who traveled from their home in Alaska to volunteer at Best Friends over the summer.The couple met Yogi on a golf cart ride. They were impressed with his sweetness and moved by his history. They asked if they could keep him overnight, at their hotel, expecting a short-term affair.\"A dog adoption was not on my list,\" says Lindberg.After going back home to Alaska, Lindberg and Miles couldn't stop talking about Yogi. They posted about him on Facebook and tried to convince their friends to adopt him.\"I knew there was someone out there who would see that despite his challenges and his age, Yogi is a great dog,\" says Lindberg.It did not take long for Lindberg to realize that she and Miles and their two kids were those someones. They put in an adoption application, and were thrilled to have it accepted.Mascis says some happy tears were shed, as Best Friends staff said goodbye. They gave Yogi a few extra walks, and a few more golf cart rides, before sending him on his way.\"We knew that Yogi could blossom in a home, and we always hoped that would come true for him,\" she says.Wellman is having a hard time keeping her eyes dry, too.\"He was just a puppy when we rescued him,\" says Wellman. \"This is the most wonderful news, that he did find a home. It makes me cry. It makes me so happy.\"Now 10 years since the sunburned puppy was delivered out of the storm and into the care of humans determined to make his life good, Yogi's come home.About a week ago, Yogi arrived in Alaska, flying up from Utah.It's been a very good week.Yogi is having some trouble with going up and down the stairs -- maybe due to arthritis, or maybe because he's never used them before -- but he has started to make friends with the household's other pets, and \"he's licking our kids like they're best buds,\" says Lindberg.The other day, as the family pulled onto their street, coming home from a trip to the ocean, Yogi stood up in the car and began to wag his tail.Lindberg thinks that might be the moment it set in for Yogi: this is where he lives now. These are his people and his people think that \"this is going to work,\" says Lindberg.\"All he really wants is a home, a family, a couch, some rides in the car, maybe a few yummy treats once in a while and some chest rubs,\" Lindberg says. \"It is just so easy to make this dog happy.\"Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com!Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "It's Time For Corporate America To Stand Up To Republican Climate Deniers", "text": "If not now, then when?This is the defining moment when corporate America needs to stand up and publicly show leadership on confronting the biggest threat to our prosperity and social cohesion -- climate change.Like a cornered wild animal, the fossil fuel industry and its supporters are recognizing the tide of history is beginning to turn against them, and they are going to act with increasing viciousness, supported by lobbying dollars, to protect their wealth and status.President Barack Obama said as much when he predicted earlier this week that “when you start seeing massive lobbying efforts backed by fossil fuel interests or conservative think tanks or the Koch brothers, pushing for new laws to roll back renewable energy standards or prevent new clean energy businesses from succeeding, that’s a problem.”To have any hope of countering these forces, progressive politicians need Brand America to put their collective head above the parapet and make it clear to the world that countering global warming is not just a moral imperative but makes good business sense.

Today, that’s no longer true.”But the truth is that while major corporations are starting to address sustainability issues within their own operations, they are in most cases still too afraid to be seen as supporters of specific climate-related policy changes.Now is the time to call out the Republican climate deniers and make it clear that, far from being supporters of business, the party is at risk of being seen as the enemy of business.I spoke with Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit focused on sustainable business and climate action, who says companies are slowly becoming bolder, recognizing that global warming offers both a financial risk and an opportunity.Even two years ago, she said it would have been difficult to conceive that 365 companies would come out in support of the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean power plan.She singles out Citigroup, “not exactly bleeding heart liberals,” which earlier this year announced a $100 billion funding commitment for renewables, not just because there was money-making potential but because it was also the right thing to do.In another encouraging sign, my colleague Shane Ferro this week highlighted business support for Californian legislation calling for tough emissions reductions. Beyond the usual suspects like Patagonia, the North Face and Ben and Jerry's, were companies less well known for climate advocacy such as Gap, Mars Inc, eBay, Los Angeles-based homebuilding company KB Home and Dignity Health, California's largest not-for-profit hospital chain.But while this growing movement is welcome, Lubber acknowledges this has not yet reached a critical mass and that too few CEOs are still prepared to speak out.She says most business leaders are wary of being seen to enter the political fray and generally use their interventions “judiciously,” often focusing on issues that are relevant to their particular business interests. Their lobbyists are also wary of calling in political favours that do not directly affect the company’s business interests. In most cases, saving the world does not figure on their list of priorities.So what does Lubber want the corporate sector to do? “We need to see those companies committing to 100 percent renewables, setting goals to reduce their carbon footprint and expecting that from their supply chains. They need to pull their resources out of business associations lobbying against climate policies and stand up publicly at state and federal levels and fight for changes on climate policy as hard as the fossil fuel companies are opposing them.”“Companies need to have a unified voice, just like the fossil fuel companies, and put resources into supporting politicians who are prepared to act boldly,” she addedThe reason progressive companies are our only hope is that, Lubber says, there's little chance of the fossil fuel companies voluntarily transitioning away from oil, coal and gas.“When I tell them they have got to pivot out of fossil fuels, many of them look at me as though I am asking them to sell women's underwear, rather than other fuel sources,” she said.Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, showed courage at last year’s Climate Week by sticking his neck out and stating, “When you realize it and you see the urgency, it is time to act now. Everyone that hasn't been on board, that's OK, but now is the time to get on board.\"Many other companies are lining up to make announcements this year that they are stepping up their game. I hope for their sakes and ours that they use the opportunity to follow Cook’s lead and display real leadership, rather than promoting their own pet projects.Time is short, let’s not waste it."}, {"title": "The Microbes Living In Your Home Say A Lot About You", "text": "There are thousands of microbial species crawling around your home right now -- and they can reveal a lot about you and anyone else who lives there.That's according to a study published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The study reveals the surprising amount of microbial diversity in the average household, and what kinds of secrets those microbes hold.What exactly can scientists learn about you from a single sample of the dust in your house?\"We can, to some degree, figure out where you live (or at the least the climate where you live), [and] who you might live with (including dogs and cats),\" Dr. Noah Fierer, a microbial ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"More generally, we can figure out what potential allergens you may be exposed to inside your home.\"For the study, the researchers examined roughly 1,200 homes across the U.S., analyzing the indoor and outdoor dust at each home.The researchers found that, on average, most homes contain more than 5,000 different species of bacteria and around 2,000 species of fungi.But don't panic. As Fierer told the Los Angeles Times, most of these household microbes are completely harmless, and some may even be beneficial.The researchers also analyzed which factors influence each home's different fungal and bacterial communities.\"For fungi, the biggest influence appears to be where your house is located,\" Fierer told HuffPost. \"For bacteria, it appears to be the human and non-human animals (i.e. dogs and cats) that you live with.\"(Story continues below.)For instance, bacteria found in your home can vary depending on the number of men and women who live there, Live Science reported. Clues to the men-to-women ratio in a home can be found in many of the local microbe populations, including skin, vaginal and even armpit bacteria.Meanwhile, the kinds of fungi residing in and around your home will vary according to your location. For example, you get different kinds of fungi if you live near a beach than you would if you live in the mountains.\"One of the key takeaways is that if you want to change what you breathe inside your house, you would either have to move very far away or change the people and the pets you live with,\" Albert Barbarán, a graduate researcher at the university and lead author of the study, said in a press release.The researchers noted that their findings could be used to help forensic investigations, as well as to better our understanding of the microbes that we often forget we share our humble abodes with.“Every day, we’re surrounded by a vast array of organisms in our homes, most of which we can’t see,” Fierer said in the same press release. \"We live in a microbial zoo, and this study was an attempt to catalog that diversity.\"How exactly do microbes colonize and control your home and body?

He Is Also A Pit Bull.", "text": "Matthew Smith has used a wheelchair for 20 years, ever since he suffered severe injuries in a motorcycle accident when he was 22 years old. Life drastically changed for him just over two years ago, however, when he got a service dog named Jericho. Jericho accompanies him everywhere, and reduces the anxiety he experiences in public places.\"Originally I pictured him just being a mobility dog -- as far as helping me move the wheelchair and picking stuff up,\" Smith told The Huffington Post. \"I never could have imagined what an emotional help he would be.\"Using a wheelchair \"takes a big hit on your self image,\" the Maryland resident explained. \"I found that Jericho takes a lot of that anxiety away from me. When I go into a store, I don't feel like they're looking at me, I feel like they're looking at Jericho.\"The benefits Jericho adds to Smith's life are in line with what an estimated 200,000 service dogs provide to people all over the country. Jericho is somewhat of anomaly, however, in that he's a pit bull. While all kinds of larger dogs can be trained to assist people, the most typical are German shepherds, golden retrievers and labradors. Breed  shouldn't matter, but areas with breed specific legislation can pose obstacles for dogs that are stigmatized based on the way they look.The five-year-old pooch was trained at the Duchess County, New York-based Animal Farm Foundation, a non-profit organization that hopes to \"secure equal treatment for pit bull dogs,\" Apryl Lea, the organization's certified Assistance Dog International trainer, told HuffPost. \"We want to show the community that pit bull dogs are just the same as any other kind of dog.\"Dogs with physical traits that are classified as pit bull-like are often characterized as aggressive, unruly and dangerous. But the term pit bull doesn't actually refer to a single breed. There are at least seven official dog breeds that are categorized as pits, as Katy Nelson, a Washington, D.C.-based veterinarian explained in a blog on HuffPost. Dogs with similar \"pit bull traits\" are often assumed to have certain behaviors, and in some cities, are banned from occupying apartments and certain spaces.Jericho is just one of the handful of dogs AFF has trained to help clients with PTSD, immobility and other disabilities, as well as to help pummel the pit bull stigma. \"They're just dogs,\" Lea said. \"All dogs are individuals. We need to look at each dog as an individual.\"Lea and Smith agree that a pit bull service animal is also working to improve the image of such dogs. \"We get stopped in public all the time,\" Smith said. \"He's an attention grabber, and it's a good icebreaker. People are so happy to see him, and I've never had a negative reaction to his breed.\"Jericho, Smith and Smith's wife recently went on an Alaskan cruise together. \"I think most people knew Jericho's name than most of the people's name on the ship,\" Smith said, and he describes his dog just like any dedicated pet owner might.\"He's a one-of-a-kind dog.

According to Mercy For Animals, that’s the “disgusting secret” behind McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets.On Wednesday, the advocacy group released disturbing hidden-camera footage capturing what it says is evidence of abusive practices at a McDonald’s chicken supplier.The investigation into T&S Farm, located in Dukedom, Tennessee, “exposed horrific cruelty to animals, including birds beaten, crammed in filthy sheds, stabbed to death with nails attached to makeshift clubs and left to suffer and slowly die without proper veterinary care,” the group wrote.The farm had likely supplied chicken for McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, McChicken sandwiches and grilled and deep-fried chicken filets, according to The Associated Press.Watch the video below. Be warned that it contains graphic footage:The video has reportedly prompted McDonald's and its supplier Tyson Foods to sever ties with T&S Farm. The Weakley County Sheriff's Office has also opened an investigation, Reuters reported.“Animal well-being is a priority at our company and we will not tolerate the unacceptable animal treatment shown in this video,” said a Tyson spokesman. “Members of our animal well-being team are investigating; however, based on what we currently know, we are terminating the farmer’s contract to grow chickens for us.”In a statement, McDonald’s said that it supported Tyson’s decision and is participating in its investigation. The fast food chain added that it was committed to “animal health and welfare at the farm level.”T&S Farm has yet to comment on the allegations.Mercy for Animals said the abuses witnessed at T&S are anything but unique. The group claims it has conducted dozens of similar undercover investigations in the past -- including at a Walmart pork supplier, a California duck farm and a McDonald’s egg supplier.Director of Investigations Matt Rice said investigators are always faced with images that “shock and horrify,” no matter what factory farm they visit.“Unfortunately this type of animal abuse runs rampant in the animal agriculture industry,” Rice told AP.Earlier this year, McDonald’s announced that it would start phasing out the use of chickens raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its U.S. restaurants.“For public health, this is really a game changer,” Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts' antibiotic resistance project, told Reuters in March.Mercy for Animals has set up a website called McDonald's Cruelty, which details their allegations against the fast food chain.

Cecil the lion's murder by an American hunter who paid local trackers to lure the popular animal out of the protection of a Zimbabwe national park so he could be killed and beheaded as a trophy fueled international outrage. So did the killing of Blaze the grizzly bear in Yellowstone Park after the mother and her cubs were surprised by an off-trail hiker, who Blaze instinctively attacked and then ate. (Actually, like a good mom, she buried part of the hiker's remains so her family would have food later.)Prompting far less attention, but way more important to the evolving issue of how humans should treat non-humans, was the publication of Beyond Words, What Animals Think and Feel, by Carl Safina, a thoughtful, moving, and important book about animal cognition and emotion. Safina writes with respect, affection, admiration, even awe about the remarkable cognitive abilities of many animals, and argues that we should treat non-human creatures with more respect. But he is a scientist, and he bases his case not on emotion alone but on the firm and ever-mounting body of evidence that non-human beings, with whom we have far more in common biologically and behaviorally than what separates us, are significantly more sentient, intelligent, and rational than we give them credit for.  Safina focuses on elephants, wolves, dolphins and killer whales, but his examples range from apes to fish to birds to insects. The stories Safina tells are remarkable. They provide powerful evidence of animal intelligence, learning, and self-awareness (defined not by whether the animal can recognize itself in a mirror -- Safina ridicules this as too narrow a measure of self-awareness -- but whether the animal is aware of itself as a unique being separate from others).There is stunning and ample evidence -- at least among the social animals -- of what only can be described in human emotional terms; the family warmth and affection among elephants, the mourning of killer whales at the loss of a child (descriptions of the wailing and frenzy of parent killer whales when their juveniles are abducted for display in marine amusement parks are heartbreaking), or the excitement and happiness dolphins demonstrate when re-uniting with human researchers they see only occasionally.And there are numerous instances of animals displaying what in a human terms we'd describe as personality; individual animals within each species who are more playful, aggressive, docile, curious, or animals with better or worse skills as family leaders.  In case after case non-human animals consistently demonstrate the ability to intelligently figure things out, to make the right choices, to actively interpret all sorts of cues - sounds, smells, gestures -- in order to find food, identify mates, ensure safety, and interact successfully with their environments.All sorts of animals have social skills. Many demonstrate what can only be described as emotions. They think. They feel. Safina argues that we have to stop thinking about animals by asking \"What are you?\" and start also considering \"Who religion, are you.\"Buried inside Safina's moving and evidence-based argument that non-human animals are worthy of respect and moral treatment is an even more profound message. If rationality is defined as basing one's judgments and behaviors on an objective analysis of the evidence, our non-human partners on the Tree of Life have it all over us. He writes;There is in nature an overriding sanity and often, in humankind, an undermining insanity. We among all animals are most frequently irrational, distortional, delusional, worried. It's not rationality that's uniquely human; it's irrationality.We are the only species known to deny overwhelming evidence -- about vaccines, about climate change, about the dangers of smoking -- in ways that actually put us in greater danger. The emotional nature of human risk perception can sometimes produce a literally self-destructive irrationality. Non-human animals don't make such mistakes.With our unique ability to foresee the future, we are the only species known to invent phantom beliefs, complete with detailed rules of behavior and morality, to give ourselves the illusion of control over our uncertain fates. Non-human animals don't have religions. They don't need them. As Safina observes;Other animals are great and consummate realists. Only humans cling unshakably to dogmas and ideologies that enjoy complete freedom from evidence, despite all the evidence to the contrary.And as Safina notes, it is patently irrational for humans to deny the voluminous evidence that animals think and feel. Is that just anthropomorphic arrogance? Or is it necessary to absolve ourselves for the callousness (and outright cruelty) with which we treat non-humans? Safina asksWhy do human egos seem so threatened by the thought that other animals think and feel. Is it because acknowledging the mind of another makes it harder to abuse them?Or, as Safina quotes Charles Darwin:\"Animals, whom we have made our slaves, we do not like to consider our equal.\"Beyond Words joins Virginia Morell's Animal Wise: The Thoughts and Emotions of Our Fellow Creatures and other writing on animal cognition as the equivalent for non-humans to Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow and Daniel Ariely's Predictably Irrational and lots of other literature on human cognition; works that pull together remarkable recent discoveries about how living beings think. These popular works are bringing into focus, and wider awareness, what research has discovered in the past 30-40 years; that non-human animals are more sentient, intelligent, and rational than we have assumed, and that humans are far less rational than we have pretended.Now if only we can use this knowledge, about human and non-human intelligence, more intelligently."}, {"title": "35 Of Pope Francis's Most Prophetic Statements", "text": "Pope Francis has brought new spirit into the Catholic Church with his humble lifestyle and direct and often challenging commentary on world affairs and personal ethics.

The new research shows that sea level rise most likely will be at the high end of that range, said University of Colorado geophysicist Steve Nerem.Sea levels are rising faster than they did 50 years ago and “it’s very likely to get worse in the future,” Nerem said.The changes are not uniform. Some areas showed sea levels rising more than 9 inches (25 cm) and other regions, such as along the U.S. West Coast, actually falling, according to an analysis of 23 years of satellite data.Scientists believe ocean currents and natural cycles are temporarily offsetting a sea level rise in the Pacific and the U.S. West Coast could see a significant hike in sea levels in the next 20 years.“People need to understand that the planet is not only changing, it’s changed,” NASA scientist Tom Wagner told reporters on a conference call.“If you’re going to put in major infrastructure like a water treatment plant or a power plant in a coastal zone ... we have data you can now use to estimate what the impacts are going to be in the next 100 years,” Wagner said.Low-lying regions, such as Florida, are especially vulnerable, added Michael Freilich, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division.”Even today, normal spring high tides cause street flooding in sections of Miami, something that didn’t happen regularly just a few decades ago,” Feilich said.More than 150 million people, mostly in Asia, live within 3 feet (1 meter) of the sea, he added.The biggest uncertainty in forecasting sea level rise is determining how quickly the polar ice sheets will melt in response to warming temperatures.“Significant changes are taking place today on ice sheets,” said Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California in Irvine. “It would take centuries to reverse the trend of ice retreat.”Scientists said about one-third of the rise in sea levels is due to the expansion of warmer ocean water, one-third to ice loss from the polar ice sheets and the remaining third to melting mountain glaciers.(Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by David Adams and Cynthia Osterman)Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "New Report Highlights Koch Brothers' Role In Hurricane Katrina Damage", "text": "WASHINGTON -- A new report from the Democratic opposition research group American Bridge's Bridge Project describes the way Charles and David Koch, the influential conservative billionaires, put their vast resources into actions that exacerbated the impact of Hurricane Katrina and stalled the Gulf Coast’s recovery.The report, released Thursday, highlights the Koch brothers' influence on the region before and after the storm, including constructing and operating pipelines that destroyed wetlands south of New Orleans and attempting to obstruct legislation that would have aided the recovery.The report describes a federal class-action lawsuit claiming that Koch Pipeline Company and other major oil companies were “partly responsible for the destruction of 1 million acres of marshlands and also for millions more acres of dying marshland.” The destruction of the marshlands eliminated New Orleans' \"natural protection against hurricane winds and storm surges,” according to the lawsuit. The case was later dismissed because a judge deemed it “ambitious.”The Bridge Project also details an unsuccessful Koch-backed legislative effort to oppose a bill that was intended to promote recovery by limiting premiums for flood insurance. The Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act sought to place a limit on rate increases for people at higher risk of being affected by hurricanes and other damaging storms.The Koch-funded conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and other conservative organizations signed a letter in February 2014 urging GOP lawmakers to oppose government intervention in the flood insurance market by voting against the bill. (The legislation had the support of then-Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), whom AFP supported in his successful 2014 Senate campaign.)As the Bridge Project report points out, AFP defended itself by touting its support for an amendment to the bill that would have slowed down the insurance rate increases. However, the conservative groups sent the letter opposing the bill a month after the amendment had been shelved.Though some of the findings in the report have been documented previously, it highlights the Kochs' extensive political and economic influence. The findings add to the long list of instances of the brothers' network of conservative groups attempting to obstruct environmental legislation. Koch-backed groups have advocated against state-level proposals that incentivize companies to invest in renewable energy. On the business side, their companies have shut down oil refineries and factories in several states, which many critics have alleged were efforts to avoid incurring environmental cleanup costs.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Earth's Resources for 2015 Have Already Been Used Up", "text": "Global Biocapacity / Global Footprint NetworkHumanity is placing inordinate demands on nature, and it just keeps getting worse. In 2000, humanity had exceeded its \"ecological budget\" by October. This year, \"Earth Overshoot Day\" was August 13, according to the Global Footprint Network, a California-based environmental think tank. Earth Overshoot Day marks the moment \"when humanity's annual demands on nature exceed what Earth can regenerate that year.\" This is yet another wake-up call that sustainable global development hasn't taken root despite two decades of effort. Humanity currently needs 1.6 Earths to cover what we take from nature each year.Global Footprint Network doesn't quantify how the accumulated deficits have impacted the long-term ecological health of the planet, but they say they are a cause for alarm. \"It is not clear whether a sustained level of overuse is possible without significantly damaging long-term biocapacity, with consequent impacts on consumption and population growth.\" In other words, damaging Earth's long-term capacity to provide ecosystem services could result in lower levels of overall services, and that means fewer crops, fish, trees, and less fresh water.The biggest cause of the overshoot is, of course, skyrocketing carbon emissions, which demand that nature sequester carbon at far higher rates than is possible. The group says that carbon sequestration make up more than half of the total demand on nature. Other demands take the form of energy, fishing, timber and paper production, food and fiber, and settlements.Global Footprint Network includes settlements because they believe once land has been developed, its basic ecological functions have essentially been made \"non-productive.\" While sustainable design practices can help make even developed land restore some its original ecological productivity, the group is largely correct because these practices are still not widespread. Estimates put the total share of green buildings worldwide at just a few percentage points, if that, and there is no data on worldwide sustainable designed landscapes.The costs of \"ecological overspending\" are also clear. As carbon dioxide levels exceed the Earth's absorptive capabilities, the excess enters the atmosphere, warming it. On the ground, the ongoing struggle between the expansion of human settlements and expanding agricultural production results in deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and reductions in fresh water availability. Cropland, grazing land, and developed land all tax nature's ecological carrying capacity as they reduce its regenerative abilities. \"All these demands compete for space. As more is being demanded for food and timber products, fewer productive areas are available to absorb carbon from fossil fuel.\"The think tank offers a smart interactive map that shows each country's per capita biocapacity alongside its ecological footprint, measured in global hectares (there's also an alphabetical list of all countries). Biocapacity per person is calculated each year based on a range of factors, including ecosystem management approaches; agricultural practices, including fertilizer use and irrigation; ecosystem degradation; population growth; and weather. And ecological footprint per person is calculated according to the amounts being consumed and production efficiency standards.According to these charts, the biocapacity of the U.S. has been falling while the ecological footprint, with periodic jumps up and down, has largely held steady. But this really means that the deficit between the available biocapacity and the U.S.'s ecological footprint is only growing. China's biocapacity has largely held steady, while it's ecological footprint has exploded beginning around 2000, only expanding the gap. Japan now requires 5.5 Japans to support one actual Japan each year: Its biocapacity continues to shrink while its ecological footprint has only increased. But, interestingly, with the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia's biocapacity has actually grown dramatically -- one of the few positive environment outcomes from that oil and gas exporter -- while its ecological footprint shrank but is now creeping up again.National biocapacity / Global Footprint NetworkAs part of the interactive map, the organization lists all the countries that are a \"biocapacity reserve,\" meaning they produce materials and consume resources far below the levels that tax nature's abilities. These are mostly developing countries in Africa, South America, and the Middle East, along with developing countries with huge environmental bounties like Brazil.Biocapacity Reserve / Global Footprint NetworkAnd then, also the countries that have biocapacity deficits, meaning they consume and produce far more than their natural environments can sustain. These countries are wealthy, urbanized countries like Singapore, Japan, and Israel.Biocapacity Deficit / Global Footprint NetworkThese compelling tools demonstrate what many environmentalist believe -- that the Earth's ledger is out of balance. As the famed biologist E.O. Wilson wrote in The Future of Life, one of his best books, \"the constraints of the biosphere are fixed.\" This means that either the earth's biocapacity needs to be increased, or human consumption and production need to be decreased to reach a sustainable balance.Already, the Earth has 7 billion people, with the numbers just growing each year. E.O. Wilson and other scientists have pointed to the number 10 billion as the ultimate maximum capacity. While techno-utopians believe there will be a new green revolution that will only increase the productivity of agriculture, what about the never-ending growth of grazing animals? They are not ecological assets. Wilson argues that \"if everyone agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land (3.5 billion acres) would support about 10 billion people.\"And what about forests? What new approaches can increase forests' capacity beyond a commitment to protecting them and planting more trees? A new special report in Science argues that the world's major forest biomes are struggling despite the best efforts of dedicated forestry officials around the world.Global Footprint Network experts see the rise of renewable energy sources like wind and solar as one of the most positive steps in helping to keep every country in its ecological budget.Explore the interactive map and learn more at Global Footprint Network."}, {"title": "NASA: Sea Level Rise Likely To Get Much Worse", "text": "Sea levels worldwide rose an average of nearly 3 inches (8 cm) since 1992, the result of warming waters and melting ice, a panel of NASA scientists said on Wednesday.In 2013, a United Nations panel predicted sea levels would rise from 1 to 3 feet (0.3 to 0.9 meters) by the end of the century.

My mother's, sister's, and other family members' homes were destroyed by the floodwaters. We all wondered: Could our unique and beloved city survive--and thrive again?A decade later, the answer is yes. New Orleans has remade itself in many ways as a more sustainable and resilient city. It has built new elevated and more efficient public schools as neighborhoods come back. To manage water, it has turned to both hard infrastructure solutions like sea walls and pumps, as well as to softer \"green\" infrastructure such as parks and rain gardens. This renaissance has been made possible by the vision and determination of community leaders and government officials who fought red tape and pushed boundaries to innovate as they spent substantial federal resources on disaster relief and recovery.This revival offers lessons for all communities that use federal disaster recovery dollars to rebuild, adapt, and thrive in the aftermath of climate-related disasters--and ideally, to prepare in advance of such events and avoid the most dire consequences. So to mark the anniversary of Katrina, the Georgetown Climate Center is issuing a report describing these lessons. The key message: We need to modify laws and policies governing the spending of federal disaster relief money.Since Katrina, NOAA estimates that the U.S. has spent more than $554 billion in the aftermaths of weather-related disasters that have touched every state. This figure does not include this year's floods, droughts, and wildfires and will inevitably rise as disasters occur with greater frequency and intensity with a changing climate. The damage we have seen in New Orleans, in New York with Sandy and from the California drought will be dwarfed by future impacts--unless we fight climate change by reducing emissions and begin now to prepare for the \"new normal\" of a warmer planet.The good news is that we are making some progress. The Obama Administration is helping states and communities prepare for future impacts and rebuild after disasters in ways that take rising seas and other climate impacts into account. In New Orleans, for example, officials across all levels of government worked to eliminate bureaucratic barriers that would have prevented the city from rebuilding public school buildings in a smarter way, adapting to the changed understanding of the city's flood risks and new demographics. Community leaders and some at FEMA are working to spend disaster relief money to build parks and greenways that capture stormwater. These projects are not only helping the city reduce more routine flooding, they are also reducing urban heat island effect and providing open space and bike paths, cleaner air and water, and wildlife habitat.The challenge, though, is that current federal formulas for spending disaster relief money often do not take these multiple benefits into account. As a result, officials had to fight hard to use the federal dollars in innovative ways, rather than just rebuilding what had been lost. What we need now is to make these innovative approaches standard operating procedure for every community rebuilding after a disaster. The goal should be to rebuild smarter, and ensure that the investments made with federal taxpayer dollars will survive the next storm.In some cases, that means changing our laws. Our analysis shows that during New Orleans' recovery, and in recovery efforts after Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, federal agencies were constrained by statutes drafted under earlier, more static conditions. Those statutes limit flexibility to deploy scarce resources in ways that will reduce future risks from climate change.Many federal officials recognize this problem, but Congress is not on board. Recently an Oversight Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee called a hearing to criticize the Department of Homeland Security for what it called its \"misplaced focus\" in proposing to spend a mere $16 million out of a $65 billion budget on understanding and integrating climate projections in the agency's work.Given the staggering number of individuals and communities at risk from ever-increasing impacts of heat waves, storms, droughts, wildfires, and rising seas and the increasing risks to our military readiness and homeland as voiced by military leaders, it would be a dereliction of duty for our government to not consider and address these risks.It is true that, in some cases, New Orleans found creative ways to use federal disaster dollars to build in smarter, more resilient ways. But we need to make these examples the rule, not the exception, by changing the underlying legislation to incorporate flexibility. In order to be prepared for the monumental risks from a rapidly changing climate, we must confront reality head on. To do otherwise is not only throwing good money after bad, it is knowingly putting our communities--and the lives of millions of people--at risk.Vicki Arroyo is Executive Director of the Georgetown Climate Center and Professor from Practice at Georgetown University Law Center."}, {"title": "LOOKOUT!

While it may seem to be everywhere, our planet's water resources are in danger. By 2030 global demand for water will outstrip our natural supply by 40 percent. That means that in only fifteen years our beautiful planet may not be so blue anymore. Overwhelming? It can be. Critical? Yes. Preventable? You bet.Less than one percent of our Earth's water is fresh and accessible, and for millions of people, finding access to clean water is a daily challenge. I work at 1% for the Planet, a network that joins businesses all over the world that commit to donating one percent of sales to nonprofits focusing on a variety of environmental issues just like this, and we're working every day to help increase that water percentage. I'm proud to see the impact that our network is making, but it's not just the businesses that have a role to play in protecting our planet. YOUR efforts matter just as much - if not more - and there are many ways that you can use your power of one to make a difference.The way I see it, individuals are the ripples that create waves of change, and I encourage everyone to utilize that power. So how can you have a positive impact on water access and quality? You can join 1% for the Planet's member businesses, nonprofits and ambassadors in pledging to \"Make Waves,\" by being mindful of your everyday habits and making easy changes that lead to a big difference. Start small with four simple steps:• Reduce your plastic use. Better yet, stay away from it altogether. Swap your plastic bags and bottles for reusable ones and be aware of where microplastics exist in your everyday life. They're everywhere, including microbeads in toothpaste and facewash and microfibers shed from clothing in the washing machine, and they're polluting our water. Read labels before you buy and shop smart.• Give a dam. There are over 40,000 obsolete dams left in America, blocking our rivers and preventing salmon and other wild fish to return to their natural spawning grounds. Connectivity and cleanliness are vital to healthy ecosystems, sustainable food sources and wildlife, and idle dams impede this connection. Check out DamNation for more information on the issue, sign the petition and see how you can get involved!• Live on the edge. In my mind, there's no better reminder of our planet's natural resources like long walks on the beach, weekends at the lakeshore and time spent at water's edges. As you spent your summer in the sand, take time to think about the life the water around you sustains and be mindful of your impact on it. Pick up trash that you see and educate yourself on ways that you can help protect these resources - otherwise, they won't be there for much longer.• Worship your water. You probably don't realize it, but seventy percent of fresh water is used for agriculture. Where does it go? Livestock. It can take up to 2,500 gallons of water to produce a single pound of beef. Compare that to the mere 220 gallons of water it takes to produce a pound of Californian soy tofu. Try lowering your impact by going meatless once a week with a Meatless Monday party and always opt for sustainable seafood. Encourage friends and family to do it with you to help create a habit you can stick to.As with anything, it's the small changes that lead to the next big step. Take notice of the natural beauty that's around you every single day and remember the role you play in affecting lasting change.

In some areas, the ROV dove to depths of 330 feet.\"It's a wild and dynamic environment,\" Steffan Howe, Parks Victoria's marine science manager, told The Huffington Post.The Wilsons Promontory National Park sits on a peninsula in Victoria, Australia's southernmost state, and is surrounded by the Bass Strait, which separates the mainland from the island of Tasmania. The peninsula used to form a land bridge to Tasmania, according to Howe.\"Part of the area we are looking at was actually above sea level during the last ice age,\" he said.The research team uncovered stunning physical features in the marine park's deep waters, including boulders the size of houses, underwater sea caves and 100-foot high sand dunes shaped by the ocean currents.Physical features aside, what really makes the marine park's seafloor comparable to the Great Barrier Reef is the \"spectacular invertebrate communities and abundant fish communities within these areas,\" Howe explained.\"It looks like a biodiversity hotspot in Victoria, or even possibly nationally.\"This site could be important for conservation efforts because it contains \"amazing communities with really, really high biodiversity structures,\" Matt Edmunds, a marine biologist who steered the ROV during exploration of the area, told the local newspaper The Age.\"We discovered quite a few different community types that we didn't even think existed out there, in terms of sponge gardens and coral assemblages,\" Edmunds said, noting that they also found big cup or plate sponges that had never been observed in Victoria before.Although the area is only 150 miles from Melbourne, scientists previously knew very little about the marine life in Wilsons Promontory, Howe told HuffPost. The area is remote and the weather is unpredictable, making it very difficult to access.With advanced technology like the robotic vehicle and underwater cameras, the habitats can be observed by humans, perhaps, for the first time ever.\"It’s fair to say that the majority of what we’re seeing here hasn’t been seen before,\" Howe said.\"We’re still analyzing a lot of the video footage, which will take some time,\" he added. \"But given the diversity of the marine life we’ve seen, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some species that we haven’t seen before.\"With the plethora of new information, researchers can better understand the region's biodiversity and better protect the marine reserve to \"minimize impact and threats to these sort of communities,\" Howe said. But the scientists want to encourage recreational diving in the area.Parks Victoria officials still need to collect and analyze more video to determine which areas might be safe for scuba divers, Howe said.\"We really hope that this will stimulate a lot of interest amongst divers,\" he said, \"and give them some appetite to explore this area.\"Below, explore the newly discovered depths of Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park -- the Great Barrier Reef's newest competition.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Comment Card Scolds National Park For Failing To Train Bears Better", "text": "For some people, the problem with the great outdoors is ... it's outdoors.Take this visitor to Yellowstone National Park, for instance, who failed to see any bears and recommended lodge employees train them better.

The human toll was devastating. But so was the toll on thousands of companion animals throughout the Gulf coast. An estimated 250,000 dogs and cats were displaced or died as a result of the storm.Animal rescue groups rushed to the scene and committed themselves to the daunting challenge of saving as many lives as they could. The ASPCA worked closely with the Louisiana SPCA and the Humane Society of South Mississippi, sending dedicated staff to work on the ground for two years and contributing $13 million in grants for rescue, reunification and sheltering efforts.In collaboration with our partners, we helped reunite more than a thousand pets with their owners, and helped transport over 7,500 homeless and displaced animals to the Lamar-Dixon Exposition Center in Gonzales, Louisiana, which had been dedicated to their care.Despite weeks of round-the-clock work from responders and volunteers, flaws in the process kept us from being even more effective. It became obvious that new organizational approaches and legal fixes were necessary to get ahead of the next major calamity.Less than a year after the storm, two groups were formed with formal support and participation from the ASPCA: the National Animal Rescue and Sheltering Coalition (NARSC) and the National Alliance of State Animal and Agricultural Emergency Programs (NASAAEP). These coalitions are dedicated to enhancing communications between animal welfare organizations, state agencies, and volunteers during emergencies. They also conduct in-depth trainings around the country on topics including flood and fire rescue, pet first aid, proper animal handling, decontamination, and animal sheltering and assessment.On the federal legislative side, two Acts passed by Congress - the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act - added pets to existing federal guidelines for disaster planning, and designated FEMA as the lead agency for pets in federally declared disasters. These laws not only save lives, but elevate the issue of animal safety to its rightful place among other natural disaster priorities.Another measure only recently proposed, the Animal Emergency Planning Act, would require businesses that house pets - including pet breeders, research facilities, zoos, animal carriers and animal handlers - to develop detailed contingency plans for animal care in cases of emergency. These businesses profit or benefit from animals; it only make sense that they take full responsibility for the animals' safety.Important legislative work is also happening at the state level. If you live in California, I urge you to join us and the American Red Cross in supporting AB 317, which will facilitate the establishment of vital emergency shelters in the event of a state emergency. We're collaborating with the Red Cross to also find ways of co-locating animal and human shelters to help keep families and their pets together during severe crises. AB 317 faces a critical final vote in the Senate next week before heading to Governor Brown's desk for his consideration.Setting up animal shelters quickly is crucial. During Katrina, many of the existing Louisiana shelters were flooded, making emergency facilities the only available shelters across four parishes.In New York, lawmakers recently passed a bill that will enable veterinarians to cross state lines to respond to pets in disasters and other crises. Because these unexpected events can often overwhelm local agencies, it's vital to facilitate the quick arrival of out-of-state veterinarians who specialize in shelter medicine, forensic sciences, and emergency response protocol. This bill is currently awaiting Governor Cuomo's signature.Of course, the biggest responsibility for keeping pets safe and alive during disasters belongs to their owners. When owners don't take necessary precautions, it puts both them and their animals in danger. According to a Fritz Institute poll, 44 percent of New Orleans residents delayed or chose not to evacuate the city during Hurricane Katrina because they refused to leave their pets behind. A similar nationwide poll by Lake Research Partners on behalf of the ASPCA found 42 percent of Americans would also not evacuate without their pets.Simple, inexpensive preparations can keep owners from having to choose between their pets' lives and their own. Some of the most important tips:• Micro-chip your pets and make sure they wear collars and ID tags with up-to-date contact information.• Keep current photos of your pets on hand.• Establish quick exit routes in your home, and know the locations of local animal shelters, pet-friendly hotels and friends who can watch your pets for you.• Put alert stickers on your windows to let rescuers know pets currently live there. (Please remove them if no animals are inside)• Put together an emergency kit, including pet carriers, canned food, bowls, bottled water, first aid items, garbage bags, and blankets.• The ASPCA also has a new shareable infographic and free mobile app dedicated to helping owners prepare for disaster and find lost pets.With natural disasters always threatening to wreak havoc on our lives, we must continue to learn from them and actively prepare for their effects. This is the best way to protect ourselves as well as those whose lives depend on us.Matthew Bershadker is President and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)."}, {"title": "EPA Clean Power Plan Attacks Based on Flawed Reports", "text": "Critics of President Barack Obama's landmark regulation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions almost always highlight a series of flawed studies (which are often paid for by utility or fossil fuel interests) to attack the Clean Power Plan.Many of these flawed, industry-backed reports analyzed the EPA's draft rules or a broad idea of regulating existing emissions, instead of the EPA's final (and official) draft regulations.

Pit bulls. The policies define \"pit bull\" differently, since it is not a specific breed, but, rather, a general category. While the Army, for instance, defines pit bulls as \"American Staffordshire Bull Terriers or English Staffordshire Bull Terriers,\" the Marines' policy doesn't define the term at all.It's unclear how exactly officials determine the breed or type of dog. The Marines policy states that if a dog does not have formal breed certification, a veterinarian will be tasked with determining the breed, and a 2013 article by Amy Bushatz, editor-in-chief of Military.com's family blog, indicates this is the case in the Army as well. Bushatz explains that these classifications, based primarily on looks and first impressions, can be highly arbitrary.Regardless, the restrictions are somewhat ironic, because not only do pit bulls regularly act as service dogs for veterans, some of the most celebrated canines in U.S. military history were pit bulls as well.Here are a few historical military pups who would most likely be banned from many military housing facilities today. While not all of their breeds are known, they have all been considered pit bulls at some point by historians and the media based on their appearances, and would likely be classified as such today.Sergeant Stubby: Decorated DogThis courageous canine World War I veteran was described as a “bull terrier” in his New York Times obituary and a \"pit bull\" in historian Michael Lemish's book War Dogs. Stubby was adopted as a pup in 1917 by Pvt. J. Robert Conroy, who found the young dog on the fields of Yale University.He soon became the mascot of the 102nd Infantry, 26th Yankee Division, and even learned a special dog salute, in which he held his right paw up near his eye. Conroy smuggled Stubby along with him when the unit headed to France, and the commanding officer allowed Stubby to stay after the dog saluted him.Stubby was reportedly was able to detect poison gas, waking up soldiers in the trenches to warn them to flee, the obituary notes. At one point, he even held a German soldier by his pants until U.S. forces could nab him. The National Museum of American History says Stubby was promoted to the rank of Sergeant after assisting in the capture, though Lemish says Stubby was never officially given rank by the military.After the war ended, Stubby became a bone-a fide celebrity, touring the country and meeting three different presidents.One of Stubby’s best traits, though, was his good-natured spirit. From his obituary:The noise and strain that shattered the nerves of many of his comrades did not impair Stubby's spirits. Not because he was unconscious of danger. His angry howl while a battle raged and his mad canter from one part of the lines to another indicated realization. But he seemed to know that the greatest service he could render was comfort and cheerfulness.While Stubby wasn't technically awarded any military medals, the men of the 102nd attached a Victory Medal to his collar to commemorate his service, according to Lemish. A group of French women also made Stubby a special blanket after the town of Chateau-Thierry was recaptured by French and American forces. After the war, people who met the \"hero dog\" would pin medals to the blanket.He died peacefully in his sleep. Stubby’s skin was preserved on a plaster cast and is now on display at the American History Museum, along with his blanket and medals.Dog Jack: Canine Prisoner of WarDuring the Civil War, the soldiers of the Union’s 102nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment cared so much about Dog Jack -- a mixed-breed dog with a distinctive patch over one eye -- that they exchanged a prisoner of war to get him back after he was captured by Confederate troops in 1863.Unfortunately, Dog Jack went missing the following year, and no one is sure what happened to him. Some speculate that thieves picked him up because of his silver collar. Soldiers in his regiment later commissioned a portrait of the beloved canine.The 2010 movie \"Dog Jack\" was loosely inspired by the dog's life and starred a deaf female pit bull, Piglet, as Jack.Sallie: Loyal MascotThis Staffordshire terrier was so beloved by the Union Army’s 11th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War that she was commemorated in a monument at Gettysburg. As a puppy, Sallie was given to the regiment as a gift and quickly became its mascot. Sallie demonstrated her incredible loyalty during the Battle of Gettysburg, when she got separated from the troops and was found three days later guarding the bodies of dead soldiers from her unit.Sallie ultimately lost her life when she was shot in the head during the Battle of Hatcher’s Run in 1865. Her fellow soldiers buried her on the field.Harvey: Friend To Soldiers And SquirrelsAnother Civil War pup, Harvey was one mascot of the 10th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, which became known as the “barking dog regiment” because it had so many canines in tow. Harvey’s proud owner inscribed his dog tags with the words “I am Lieutenant D.M. Stearns dog; whose dog are you?”In a letter home to his children, Capt. William Jordan wrote that Harvey and two other dogs had “the run of the regiment,” and described Harvey saving the life of a squirrel. Another regiment dog, Teaser, chased after the squirrel -- which soldiers were keeping as a pet -- but Harvey picked up the small animal in his mouth and carried it to safety.The dog was also known for swaying from side to side while soldiers sang campfire songs. Some attributed this to a love of music, though at least one private believed that the music just hurt the dog’s ears.Harvey was wounded in battle twice, but survived the war, and the soldiers of his unit later memorialized the dog in a portrait and on keepsake buttons.Contact the author at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com.For the second year, The Huffington Post is holding a week-long, community-driven effort to bust the myths and raise awareness about pit bulls, a maligned \"breed\" that often bears the brunt of dated, discriminatory legislation that can make it near-impossible for these dogs to find a forever home.

There are plenty of good options -- but opening up the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to more offshore oil drilling isn't one of them. It's like trying to empty the bath without turning off the faucet.Yet that's the awkward stance that President Obama will be taking in Alaska next week, where he'll promote his climate change policies and Arctic stewardship against the backdrop of global concern about his decision to let Shell drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea. He'll address a conference of nations with interests in the Arctic and somehow try to convince them not to follow the example he's setting.Climate scientists say at least a third of the world's currently-identified oil reserves must remain safely in the ground to avoid cataclysmic impacts to our oceans and climate. Add the oil under the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, which isn't now counted as oil reserves but is estimated to contain about 95 billion barrels of crude oil, and you've got a carbon bomb of massive proportions.But here's what's so strange: President Obama has made addressing climate change a higher priority than any previous president, recently unveiling new controls on power plant emissions. Yet over the past year, he's also called for offshore oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, endangering wildlife and undermining his own greenhouse gas reduction goals.How can a president who pledges to address \"the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate\" single-handedly add two untapped oceans of burned oil to our planet's atmosphere that's already in crisis?Worldwide oil production and carbon emissions are already at all time highs. Let's not dig ourselves any deeper into this hole.President Obama's main obstacle to a good climate change policy isn't the global warming denial crazies in Congress - his own policies have accelerated domestic oil production, even in environmentally-sensitive areas.We see a similar disconnect in California, where Gov. Jerry Brown recently told a Vatican climate change conference that we must leave a third of oil reserves in the ground. And yet, he supports expanded oil production in his state, including recently-authorized controversial offshore fracking permits to squeeze more oil from beneath the ocean floor.If risking their credibility as climate leaders isn't enough, perhaps Obama and Brown should consider the very real and present environmental risks of offshore drilling, an inherently dangerous form of oil extraction.The industry itself makes the case, whether it's the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 or, just a few months ago, the crude oil that coated the Santa Barbara coastline and killed hundreds of birds and marine mammals. These weren't aberrations - this is simply the price we pay for offshore oil drilling, an inevitable cost of this risky business.In the Chukchi Sea, where the Obama administration recently allowed Shell to begin its long-sought Arctic oil drilling operations, conditions are so hazardous that even the Department of the Interior admits there is a 75 percent chance of an oil spill of at least 42,000 gallons of crude. Containing a spill would be far tougher in the unforgiving Arctic than in the relatively calm Gulf of Mexico, which BP found so difficult, and cleaning a spill in that churning, icy sea would be impossible.Even before drilling takes place, the seismic testing for oil in the Atlantic, according to an Interior report, could injure 138,000 dolphins and whales, including endangered North Atlantic right whales whose calving grounds are in the impact zone, and disrupt marine mammal feeding, calving, breeding, and other vital activities more than 13.5 million times. Nonetheless, the Obama administration quietly opened the public comment period on four seismic testing applications on July 28, as environmentalists were busy criticizing his Arctic drilling authorization from the week before.The world doesn't need more oil wells, and even if it did, the Arctic and Atlantic oceans are terrible places to put them. We can do better -- future generations of both people and wildlife are depending on it."}, {"title": "Creating a Vision to Match the Scenery of Our Public Lands", "text": "On several occasions over the past few years, Park Rangers for Our Lands has called on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to do a better job of balancing energy development with the protection of our national parks and neighboring public lands. As a former park superintendent and ranger, I know that most visitors do not distinguish between what lies within national parks and what lies without. Take a drive to Moab, Utah, home of Arches and Canyonlands national parks, or Dinosaur National Monument in northwestern Colorado - without an entrance or boundary sign, can you tell where national parks end and the BLM lands begin? Probably not - and I can hardly blame you. The world-class scenery is the same, and so are the pristine night skies. And the elk, mule deer and other wildlife that so many visitors come to see? They tend not to care about the artificial boundaries, either.That's why I'm very pleased with the progress that the BLM is making. Over the past two weeks, the BLM has finalized a \"master leasing plan\" (MLP) for the remote, wildlife-rich public lands around Dinosaur National Monument and proposed another for the magnificent canyon country that surrounds Arches and Canyonlands. MLPs are designed to strike a balance between conserving important resources - like national parks and the scenic lands that often surround them - and oil and gas development. With the MLPs just announced, I think BLM comes very near to hitting that elusive mark. Both plans recognize the importance of being a good neighbor and include measures to guide oil and gas development away from national parks - to locations where industry can drill without blemishing night skies or world-class scenery. The MLPs also ensure that the right conversations happen with the National Park Service before development moves forward. Finally, I think both MLPs do a good job of recognizing and responding to the needs of local communities, which have become increasingly dependent on tourist dollars and visitation to the national parks.Are the MLPs perfect? No. They would still allow drilling in places that should probably stay undeveloped - because they border a national park or popular hiking and mountain biking trails. But are the MLPs a strong step in the right direction? In my opinion, yes. The BLM has come a long way - it was only a few years ago that through a process often byzantine and obscure, at least to most members of the public, the agency leased thousands of acres on the doorstep of Arches and Canyonlands national parks for oil and gas drilling. The BLM's effort to use MLPs should be commended. These MLPs, which were created through an open public process and with the input of key stakeholders, like the National Park Service, should help avoid future conflicts with the protection of our national parks, while providing far greater certainty for all industries and users of our public lands.But the job's not finished. For Moab, the BLM must continue to work diligently on the MLP, with an eye to finishing that plan sometime next summer. If any place is in need of a management plan to match its scenery (to paraphrase Wallace Stegner), it's Moab. On a broader scale, the BLM must continue to embrace MLPs and the spirit of the oil and gas leasing reforms it announced in 2010. There are other places, including around Mesa Verde National Park, where the BLM can use MLPs as a means of broadening public discourse over where, how and when oil and gas development should happen.In the challenge to find the right balance in planning for the future of our public lands, we might remember that part of the Hippocratic oath first written nearly 2,500 years ago. First, do no harm."}, {"title": "Cynical Opportunists", "text": "For most Republican politicians, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucrats are \"damned if they do, and damned if they don't\".The GOP routinely accuses these bureaucrats of overregulating industry, yet in the next breath, doesn't hesitate to denounce them for failing to fulfill their regulatory responsibility. That contradictory dichotomy was on display in the Republicans' scathing criticism of the EPA's recent botched reclamation of an abandoned Colorado hard rock mine. The agency's mishandling of the project led to a spill that contaminated the Animas River, an important source of drinking water and recreation for the region.The EPA mishap was an accident, but that did not deter its enemies from implying that the incompetency was representative of the agency's entire operation.In the eyes of anti-big government Republicans, the EPA is a bureaucratic overreaching economic scourge that needs to be drastically scaled down if not dispensed with altogether.Republicans could be accused of shedding crocodile tears for the public impacted by the Colorado spill. That is because the GOP's ideologically-driven focus has been on demonizing (and dismantling) the EPA, not on addressing the nationwide problem that the Colorado mine mishap typifies. No GOP critic bothered to mention the estimated 160,000 shuttered hard rock mineral mines scattered around the country, many of which are potential pollution hot spots that no one is even monitoring. To make matters worse, Republican critics made no reference to updating the federal 1872 Mining Law that allows abandoned mines to fester and is devoid of any cleanup funding mechanism. GOP lawmakers' Silence can be attributed to their keeping a bill to amend the 1872 law bottled up in a congressional committee at the urging of the mining industry.The hypocrisy of some Republican politicians in dealing with the EPA is breathtaking. They berate it for messing up the Animas River, yet they are the very ones who have substantially cut the budget to scale back the Agency's regulatory authority.A Republican presidential contender is even getting into the act big time. Ever an opportunist, Dr. Ben Carson visited the site to condemn the EPA for polluting the river and coming forth with a \"weak response\". This is the same guy who recently wrote in a Facebook entry that the \"EPA should be a research and technology coordinator, not an armed police force.\"One more thing. The EPA has a good operational track record but it does make mistakes, just like everyone else. The distinction is that when it does, the ensuing degradation is an accident. By contrast, the contamination that results from industrial polluters' violations usually is the product of premeditated discharges."}, {"title": "Ten Years After Katrina", "text": "Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,800 people, devastated a great American city, and caused more than a hundred billion dollars of damage. An enormous natural disaster was amplified by governmental incompetence and indifference into a human tragedy that shocked the world. Today, a full decade later, aftershocks of Katrina are still being felt, particularly in New Orleans, which has never completely recovered.Although the events of 10 years ago were certainly momentous enough in and of themselves to warrant commemoration, Katrina is also a harbinger of our future. We know that climate disruption threatens to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, from droughts to heat waves to hurricanes. Extreme storm surges like those from Katrina and Superstorm Sandy will become 10 times more frequent, even if we succeed in limiting global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That works out to a Katrina every other year.But the most important lesson we can take from Katrina has more to do with people than weather. The storm itself was only partially responsible for the extensive damage and suffering in New Orleans. When the levees failed, it was because no one cared enough to ensure that they were properly engineered and constructed. When thousands of people found themselves caught in the storm's path, it's because no one cared enough to help them evacuate. Even after the storm had passed, and survivors were sickened by the formaldehyde in FEMA trailers... well, you get the idea.When it comes to disasters caused by climate disruption and extreme weather, there's nothing fair about which people will end up being hurt the most. Low-income communities and communities of color are not only the first in the line of fire but also the last when it comes to getting help. In New Orleans, for Katrina, it was the Lower 9th Ward. In New York, for Sandy, it was the outer boroughs. But look almost anywhere and you'll find people living in frontline communities that are both more vulnerable to disasters and less able to recover in the aftermath.In fact, the same kind of injustice applies on a global scale -- many of the poor and developing nations that have been the least responsible for climate disruption will nevertheless be the hardest hit by its effects.That is why we cannot tackle climate disruption without also addressing climate justice. That means dismantling the racial and economic injustice that leaves some people, through no fault of their own, at much greater risk from the effects of climate disruption.Although clean energy doesn't guarantee climate justice, it's a key ingredient. The beautiful thing about growing a clean-energy economy is that, when done right, it not only cuts the pollution that causes climate disruption but also leads to healthier, more prosperous, and stronger communities. You can already see this happening in the Lower 9th Ward, where residents are five times as likely to have solar as elsewhere in New Orleans.Climate justice will definitely be on my mind as Sierra Club President Aaron Mair and I join the 10th Annual Katrina Memorial March and Second Line this Saturday in New Orleans. Because although no one can prevent future storms like Katrina, there's no excuse for forcing entire communities to suffer disproportionately from the consequences."}, {"title": "Tesla's Model S Is So Great It Broke Consumer Reports' Scoring System", "text": "Its price tag aside, the Tesla Model S P85D is nearly perfect.A year after Consumer Reports published a harsh critique of the electric sedan it once ranked above all other cars, Tesla's new speedy, all-wheel-drive version of the vehicle scored so high it shattered the rating system.\"The Tesla initially scored 103 in the Consumer Reports Ratings system, which by definition doesn't go past 100,\" Mark Rechtin, an editor at Consumer Reports, wrote in a review published Thursday. \"The car set a new benchmark, so we had to make changes to our scoring to account for it.\"In 80 years of testing, no car has ever earned that high a score.\"Model S receiving the first score of 100 out of 100 points from Consumer Reports is truly a testament to our commitment to continually give our customers enhancements in range, performance and value, and ultimately a better driving and ownership experience,\" Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson told The Huffington Post in an email.The Model S P85D, unveiled last year at a widely amped event, has better braking and handling and is more energy efficient than the top-scoring standard Model S, the magazine found.Tesla stock soared nearly 9 percent after Consumer Reports posted the review online.The one problem: The vehicle is insanely expensive, starting around $101,000.

The \"termination dust\" that fell every fall ahead of the deep freeze of winter made my job easier, providing an annual pause in development, with the cold winters that followed keeping the permafrost permanently frozen. Yet now, the vast and beautiful natural resources of Alaska and the broader Arctic region face their greatest threat of all: global warming.Global warming is usually expressed as an average over the globe. But the Arctic region has warmed twice as fast as the global average -- faster than any other place on Earth -- and is now 3.6 degrees warmer than 50 years ago, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The region is suffering climate impacts today that show what the rest of the world may face tomorrow. Warming in the region is contributing to the record fires in Alaska this fire season and the five million acres already destroyed, as well as to the loss of Arctic sea ice and the melting of land-based glaciers and permafrost.These impacts feed upon themselves and further accelerate warming in the region and the world. The loss of forests means carbon dioxide stored in trees and soil is returned to the atmosphere causing more warming. The loss of reflective sea ice means less incoming heat is reflected back into space. The melting of permafrost means carbon dioxide and methane trapped over eons may soon contribute to further warming. Melting land-based glaciers including in Greenland are contributing to sea-level rise and threatening to dump enough fresh water into the ocean to disrupt the currents that now keep Europe's climate temperate.In this drumbeat of bad news, however, there is a counterpoint of hope -- a strategy that can help slow warming in Alaska and the Arctic enough to avoid some of the worst impacts. The strategy is to reduce the often overlooked \"short-lived\" climate pollutants, which include black carbon soot, methane, tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone, and hydrofluorocarbons, used primarily as refrigerants. These climate pollutants are responsible for between 40-45 percent of global warming, with carbon dioxide responsible for the other 55-60 percent.Because they are short-lived in the atmosphere, cutting these pollutants can quickly reduce most of the warming they cause. An integrated assessment by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization concluded that aggressive cuts to black carbon and tropospheric ozone could cut the rate of global warming by up to half in the near term, and cut the rate of warming in the Arctic by up to two-thirds. Black carbon and tropospheric ozone are also traditional air pollutants, and reducing them would save millions of lives a year globally and improve crop yields. Cutting HFCs, which are the fastest growing climate pollutants in much of the world, can cut the rate of warming even more.Recent research from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, suggests by midcentury, an aggressive effort to reduce carbon dioxide can avoid a 0.1 degree Celsius rise in warming, while aggressive mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants can avoid up to 0.6 degree Celsius of warming midcentury, making the mitigation of short-lived pollutants more effective than that of carbon dioxide in the near term. At end of the century, cutting short-lived pollutants and carbon dioxide provides comparable benefits, each avoiding more than 1 degree Celsius of warming. These scientists calculate that cutting the short-lived climate pollutants along with carbon dioxide can significantly slow sea-level rise, with the short-lived climate pollutants responsible for more than two-thirds of the slowdown in sea-level rise by the end of the century.President Barack Obama is taking strong steps to address both long-lived carbon dioxide and short-lived climate pollutants, including efforts to increase renewable energy, improve mileage for autos, and cut carbon dioxide from new and existing power plants, along with efforts to cut HFCs, soot emissions from heavy-duty trucks, buses and vans, and most recently, methane from oil and gas production.Most importantly, the president's success at home puts him in position to encourage other world leaders to reduce both their carbon dioxide and their short-lived climate pollutants. The U.S. has done this with China, India, and Brazil for HFCs and with China on an even broader scale. At the GLACIER meeting in Anchorage next week, the president has the opportunity to urge the Arctic nations and observers including China and India to join him to take global action to cut short-lived climate pollutants along with carbon dioxide. This effort should include a global agreement to stop the growth of super greenhouse pollutants like HFCs this fall through the Montreal Protocol, a treaty signed and ratified under President Reagan that has put the stratospheric ozone layer on the path to recovery, while also providing more climate protection than any other policy or regulation. Such actions can help create a more bipartisan domestic and effective international platform for climate policy, and help save the Arctic and Alaska from the threat of runaway climate impacts.Durwood Zaelke is founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Washington, D.C., and Geneva and co-directs a related program at the University of California Santa Barbara.This Op-Ed was originally published in the Alaska Dispatch News - Anchorage Daily News on August 27, 2015."}, {"title": "Why Big Corporations Like Gap And eBay Are Mobilizing Against Climate Change", "text": "This week, California legislators received a pair of letters signed by dozens of corporations in support of two bills that would require the state to further reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through 2050. In both letters, the firms say tackling climate change is \"one of America’s greatest economic opportunities of the 21st century.\"Some of these companies you'd expect to see among advocates for stronger environmental policy: Patagonia, the North Face and Ben and Jerry's. But there are also companies less well known for climate advocacy: Gap and the candy company Mars Inc. signed both letters. eBay and the LA-based homebuilding company KB Home each signed a letter, too.One of the largest corporate supporters of both bills, Dignity Health, California's largest not-for-profit hospital chain, also signed both letters.California has been at the forefront of climate change-related legislative action. In 2006, it passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act, which required the state by 2020 to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions back down to 1990 levels (about 15 percent below where it would have been if it had continued doing nothing).With the state on track to reach that goal, these two new bills on deck in the state legislature are pushing for further reform.SB 350 calls for a 50 percent reduction in petroleum use, and a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency in existing buildings, as well as 50 percent of utility power to come from renewable energy by 2030. SB 32 would require the state to further slash greenhouse gas emissions -- to 80 percent below 1990 levels -- through 2050.California could save $8 billion on health care costs related to respiratory illnesses like asthma if the state meets the goals for 2030 laid out in SB 350, according to Rachelle Reyes Wenger, the director of public policy and community advocacy at Dignity Health.“Healing requires an environment that lets people have a healthy lifestyle,” she told The Huffington Post. “Climate change threatens to undermine 50 years of advancement in population health.”The science backs this up, particularly in California. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year found that improved air quality in California over the last 20 years is correlated with a significant decrease in children living in Southern California who have asthma.The oil industry, on the other hand, has mounted firm opposition to both bills -- and there will certainly be upfront costs to changing the way that Californians get their energy.But it's important to think about the cost of inaction as well, says Carol Lee Rawn, the director of the transportation program at the nonprofit advocacy group Ceres. \"It’s good economic policy to be addressing this. When you set ambitious goals, that drives innovation and drives investment.\"While cutting down on emissions is costly, California's aggressive stance on curbing them is also bringing it business.Proterra, a company that makes fully electric buses, is moving much of its corporate staff to California from South Carolina. Proterra CEO Ryan Popple told HuffPost that California's 2006 law allowed alternative energy companies to flourish there.\"The advantages that incumbent industries have are just enormous. There is no industry larger and more entrenched than energy. I don’t think that California protects big monopolistic industries in the way other markets do,\" he said.

Any movie, book or article that discussed wolves was high on my list. I loved watching \"Dancing With Wolves\" - although the film wasn't really just about wolves, and Kevin Costner was good to look at too!When the movie \"The Gray\" came out I was there on opening night at my local movie theater. I must admit this movie scared the crap out of me and I developed an even healthier respect for wolves. I've followed the entire debate on their endangered status in Alaska and other parts of the lower 48 states and in Canada. I just can't see how killing this magnificent animal does any good for anyone. When I learned that every 20 minutes we lose an entire species on this planet, it makes me sad - and to think we might also lose wolves makes me even sadder.You can imagine my excitement when I learned that there are places in this world where one can meet, sleep near or gaze at wolves in their natural habitats. Last November at a gathering hosted by Québec Tourism, one of the presenters mentioned that they had an adventure experience \"sleeping\" with wolves. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and volunteered to go on this trip.It was all settled, I was going. I thought that this was such a wonderful opportunity not only for me but what if my 11 year-old granddaughter Alex, went too? I'm all about intergenerational travel and found having a younger person on a trip makes the experience more rewarding for me; introducing travel to young people helps them understand the world is a lot bigger than their own neighborhoods.So, on July 13th we were off to the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region in the Québec Province - Alex and me! Before we left however, Tourism Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean had another surprise. We were not only going to a private wolf sanctuary, Aventuraid, but also to an animal wilderness park - Zoo sauvage de Saint-Félicien. The zoo was in a stunning boreal forest, and we looked forward to experiencing a camping, canoeing and hiking adventure.We arrived in Canada and were greeted by a perky, pretty and knowledgeable Tourism Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean guide - Amélie Simard. Not speaking one word of French made having her there a very good thing because all the road signs were in French!Since this was Alex's first time in Canada and on an adventure with me, I asked her to share her impressions of our trip. What follows are her journal notes. Enjoy!'I was invited by my grandmother to go on an adventure in Québec, Canada. It was my second trip out of the country and I was excited to visit another country and have the opportunity to sleep over night at a wolf conservation camp and inside a real wild animal park!I agree with everything Alex says. This was a special and extraordinary trip with my granddaughter. What a great companion. She was supportive of me when I struggled to get into the canoe (fear in my eyes I must admit), or as we hiked in the forest with nets that covered our heads as a way to ward off the mosquitoes. Alex was as real trooper. The people we met were really nice and we developed a friendship with many of them that I know will last.In each camp we had great food - fresh and tasty and well seasoned. Our guides were outstanding and well versed on their areas of expertise. Most of all, we were so happy to have Amélie with us and have now adopted her as part of our family.Québec is beautiful, and a perfect place to take the entire family.

How we might help right such a catastrophic wrong, caused in part by human hubris, human greed and human naiveté about the power of nature enraged.   So last year we made good on our promise. We gathered together architects and engineers, construction pros and product manufacturers, building owners and operators, bankers, lawyers, teachers and students in the Big Easy, and we discovered our faith hadn't been totally misplaced. True, it was happening in fits and starts, but there were new green schools, some new green housing, and a return of commerce that was beginning to feel reasonably permanent.   The haunted cemetery tours again outnumbered the disaster tours. And New Orleans' uniquely fabulous food once again graced white-linened tables from the Quarter to the Garden District.  The opening plenary stage of Greenbuild last year sat at one of the goal posts in the Superdome. The dome had been transformed into a French Quarter street scene with flickering lights and café seating sprinkled throughout the field. Once again the movement's faithful had convened for this annual rite of optimism and camaraderie, and we were proud that we knew a whole lot more than we did in 2005.Of course in the intervening years we had learned a lot about how to design, build and operate better, healthier, higher-performing buildings and communities. In the 15 short years since LEED had its start in 2000, we had changed forever the practice of architecture, the profession of building operations, and the perspective of product manufacturers, seating a new market that did not exist previously, one that is now valued at more than half-a-trillion dollars in the U.S. alone.  But we had also learned something else, something more important and more fundamental. We learned that buildings matter, not just because they provide shelter and sanctuary, not just because they provide for safe assembly for work, for play, for learning, for healing. They matter because they are the outward manifestation of our need to settle into community, to organize for progress, to ground our humanness in place and time. And we learned that we had a better chance of permanency, of success, if our buildings and communities saved energy, water and other precious resources. If they were designed and constructed with an intention of better health and greater resiliency. If they reduced the kinds of greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change and intensify nature's cycles, be they tornados, floods, fires, or hurricanes.  That night, after an incredible speech by the amazing Mayor Landrieu, one of New Orleans' own took the stage. With a voice as sweet as the pralines the city is famous for, Ivan Neville sat down at a baby grand Steinway, and made Randy Newman's song Louisiana his own:  \"What has happened down here is the winds have changed. Clouds roll in from the north and it started to rain. Rained real hard and it rained for a real long time, Six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline.  The river rose all day The river rose all night Some people got lost in the flood Some people got away alright The river have busted through clear down to Plaquemines Six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline  Louisiana, Louisiana They're tryin' to wash us away, tryin to wash us away . . .\"  And in the stillness of that evening, in a place that had become the starkest of symbols of those horrible days, we were swept back in time. Like the day Kennedy was shot, and the day the astronauts landed on the moon, pretty much everyone knows where they were the day the rains came, the river rose and the levees broke.  That evening and in the days that followed, the fear in the faces you saw on TV tore at your gut. For endless days frustration and outrage punctuated every voice you heard every minute of every news cast. Everywhere you turned were images of massive destruction and a mass of humans in desperate need, and in so many ways, it laid bare the worst of us.  But the purity of Ivan's voice reminded us that we also experienced the best of us. Hundreds of thousands of acts of simple kindness were recounted. Heroic actions were everywhere. The green building movement responded from day one with thousands of volunteers, with expertise and with vision on which a new future could be built. And our success in bringing that vision to life could be seen in the faces of the kids on their first day in their brand new LEED-certified Langston Hughes Elementary School. And it could be experienced in the Lower Ninth as Tom Darden and Brad Pitt and the team at Make it Right put down early stakes to build 150 LEED Platinum affordable homes and one neighborhood began - slowly - to be reborn.  Today you see it in the city's thriving convention business and in the new \"creative class\" that flowed into the city as the water receded, adding its own layer of uniqueness to the crazy quilt of culture that makes New Orleans so special, bringing back jobs, and people, and hope.  Ten years ago, all we could do was blindly believe in our best selves. Ten years into a recovery that will likely take several generations, it's clear New Orleans didn't wash away after all.And as long as there are people like the thousands of incredible volunteers who have worked alongside the proud and determined residents in a search of a more sustainable, resilient future, in defiance of all odds--it never will."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Recent Studies Provide Examples of Emissions Trading Successes, Failures", "text": "The emissions trading program in the northeastern United States -- the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) -- is responsible for about half the region's emissions reductions -- an amount far greater than reductions achieved in the rest of the country.The study in the journal Energy Economics determined that even when controlling for other factors -- the natural gas boom, the recession and environmental regulations -- emissions would have been 24 percent higher in participating states without RGGI (subscription). RGGI, the first market-based regulatory program in the United States, is a cooperative effort among states to create a \"cap\" that sets limits on carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector -- a cap lowered over time to reduce emissions. Power plants that can't stay under the cap must purchase credits or \"emissions allowances\" from others that can.\"While the study focused on the northeastern states and the RGGI program specifically, the findings suggest that emissions trading could be a cost-effective strategy for states now considering how to comply with EPA's recently issued regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide from power plants,\" said Brian Murray, lead author and director of the Environmental Economics Program at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.A separate study in the journal Nature Climate Change found significant misuse of a key carbon offsetting scheme after several factories increased their production of industrial waste products -- spiking emissions. It suggests that a loophole in the United Nation's carbon market may have led to \"perverse incentives\" for some industrial plants to increase emissions so they could then make money by reducing them.A companion study indicates that the majority of credits from Russia and Ukraine were a sham and that no emissions were reduced. In fact, the study estimates use of the sham offsets actually enabled greenhouse gas emissions to increase by some 600 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.\"We were surprised ourselves by the extent, we didn't expect such a large number,\" said study co-author Anja Kollmuss. \"What went on was that these countries could approve these projects by themselves there was no international oversight, in particular Russia and Ukraine didn't have any incentive to guarantee the quality of these credits.\"Study Quantifies Global Warming's Contribution to California's DroughtHow much of California's drought is due to climate change? A study published in Geophysical Research Letters has an answer: up to 27 percent. The study also indicates that climate change has made the odds of severe droughts twice as likely.Global warming has worsened the drought through increased evapotranspiration, the contribution of which was quantified in detail for the first time by researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the University of Idaho who analyzed 432 combinations of precipitation, temperature, wind and radiation data gathered between 1901 and 2014 to simulate monthly changes in soil moisture across California. When they modeled these combinations against various greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, they concluded that the state's lack of rainfall is due to natural variability -- a finding that accords with most other studies -- but that California's drought is 8 to 27 percent drier because of human-cause climate change (subscription).\"By knowing how much global warming has contributed to the trend in California drought conditions over the past century, we can reliably predict how the future will play out,\" said A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Lamont-Doherty who led the study. By the 2060s, Williams said, drought conditions will be more or less permanent, and evaporation will overpower bursts of intense rainfall.Williams likened climate change to a \"bully\" that every year \"demands more of your money than the year before. Every year, the bully -- or atmosphere -- is demanding more resources -- or water -- than ever before.\"He also said that California should more aggressively police groundwater withdrawals by agricultural operations, increasing use fees and fines for overuse. California is one of the few states that does not regulate such withdrawals, which after three years of drought have led to precipitous drops in groundwater tables and land subsidence.Obama Announces Renewable Energy InitiativesIn the first stop on an 11-day climate and energy tour, President Obama announced a number of initiatives aimed at making it easier for homeowners and businesses to invest in clean energy technology.\"We are here today because we believe that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than climate change,\" said President Obama at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas. \"But we're also here because we hold another belief, and that is, we are deeply optimistic about American ingenuity.\"The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

There would be lions in America, and elephants and rhinos roaming Europe.That's the conclusion of a new study that details how human-driven animal extinctions have influenced the distribution and populations of large mammals around the world.\"The study shows that large parts of the world would harbor rich large mammal faunas, as diverse as seen in protected areas of eastern and southern Africa today, if it was not for historic and prehistoric human-driven range losses and extinctions,\" Dr. Jens-Christian Svenning, a biologist at Aarhus University in Denmark and a co-author of the study, told NBC News.The study was published last Thursday in the journal Diversity and Distributions. The researchers analyzed what the natural distribution of large mammal species would be if not for the impact of humans.The study expands on the scientists' previous research, which showed that the mass extinction of large mammals during the last ice age and in subsequent millennia was largely linked to the spread of modern humans, not to climate change.Based on their most recent analysis, the researchers concluded that sub-Saharan Africa is virtually the only place on Earth with the naturally high diversity and population of large mammals that would be seen elsewhere if not for humans.\"Most safaris today take place in Africa, but under natural circumstances, as many or even more large animals would no doubt have existed in other places,\" Dr. Søren Faurby, a postdoctoral fellow in bioscience at Aarhus and lead author of the study, said in a press release. \"The reason that many safaris target Africa is not because the continent is naturally abnormally rich in species of mammals. Instead it reflects that it’s one of the only places where human activities have not yet wiped out most of the large animals.\""}, {"title": "The ACT Is a Beacon of Hope in Tony Abbott's Sea of Despair", "text": "Co-authored by Josh Creaser* and Charlie WoodLast weekend, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) made history when its Chief Minister - Andrew Barr - committed to divest the Government's investments in coal, oil and gas companies, making it the first state or territory in Australia to do so, and the 350th worldwide.On the same day, the ACT also became the first Government in Australia to set a 100% renewable energy target. The ACT is no stranger to leadership on climate policy. It also has the most ambitious emissions reductions target in the country and one of the most ambitious in the world.Yet, all of this local climate leadership in the ACT Assembly is incredibly ironic given the climate craziness playing out just a stone's throw up the road at Parliament House. Whilst the Territory sheds fossil fuel companies from its investment portfolio and aims sky-high on solar and wind, up in the House on the Hill, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his team are busy declaring coal good for humanity. Doggedly, they are throwing their support behind foreign mining giants and multi-billion dollar coal projects, labelling renewable energy offensive and wrecking the policies that would help steer us off a path to climate catastrophe and give our kids a chance at a brighter future.But no matter how hard Prime Minister Abbott campaigns against climate solutions, he will now have to take his seat at Parliament House, knowing that the ACT will soon be 100% powered by renewable energy and free of investments in the fossil fuel companies that he's hitched his political wagon to so hard.Of course, the ACT's climate ambition is not simply a case of progressive politicians setting progressive policies. Certainly, Canberra has its fair share of progressive politicians. But it takes a progressive community to demand progressive politics.Legislating the city's world leading emissions reductions target in 2011 was in large part thanks to a strong community campaign - Canberra Loves 40% - that engaged broad sectors of the ACT community over many months.So too was the case with last week's fossil fuel divestment announcement. Twelve months ago, Chief Minister Barr dismissed fossil fuel divestment as \"gesture politics, that I find frustrating.\" But Fossil Free ACT campaigners persisted and it is due to their two years of hard work that, on Saturday, Barr committed his Government to divest.Indeed, in committing to divest, the ACT positions itself not only as a national leader but as a global leader. From San Francisco to Stanford, the Rockefellers to RaboBank and the $900bn Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund to Norway's Capital Oslo, financial heavyweights worldwide are shedding their fossil fuel investments. These investors recognise that to profit from climate wreckage is morally and financially irresponsible. In committing to go 100% renewable, the ACT is positioning itself alongside some of the smartest economies in the world, like Denmark and China, who see that there's a brighter future for their economies in industries that don't wreck the planet.In committing to divest, the ACT is also charting a financially responsible path. Markets have financed future fossil fuel extraction on the false assumption that what fossil fuel companies have asked investors to fund can safely be burnt. But of course, if we want a liveable future, the vast majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground. Leading international authorities, like Citibank, HSBC and the IMF, are catching on to this and warning of the financial risks that continued investment in fossil fuels pose.You need only look at the performance of companies like Whitehaven Coal, currently in the ACT's portfolio, to see this in action. Whitehaven recently posted a quarterly loss in the hundreds of millions - the manifestation of a deeper trend that analysts are increasingly saying will spell the end of coal. With financiers like the World Bank and entire countries like Norway getting out of fossil fuels, the ACT is in good company as it backs away from this sector of the past.Company like that serves to highlight, again, the illogic of the Abbott Government's attachment to fossil fuels. The ACT is a beacon of hope in Tony Abbott's sea of climate despair. It is an example of the kind of climate leadership that Australia could take and it's a shining case-study in the benefits that flow when Governments listen to their constituents rather than to the vested fossil fuel interests that are crippling our democracy, undermining our communities and wrecking the fragile climate that allows us all to call this beautiful blue planet home. Imagine the positive future we could create if all of our state, territory and local governments were to follow the ACT's lead.*Josh Creaser is a campaigner with 350.org Australia and was closely involved in the Fossil Free ACT campaign."}, {"title": "11 Times Pit Bulls Were Totally Scary, Awful And Mean", "text": "Aggressive, mean and the opposite of cuddly.

If not, Inspiration Pollination wants to change that. They hope to remind you to think more about it every day, and how you can make a difference.Inspiration Pollination, an artistic movement launched by Melanie Oliva this month, takes pollination as both the problem and the cure.Pollination, as a process, means influence, not visibility. We barely notice the bees and hummingbirds shuttling pollen from blossom to blossom as they bob about the landscape. But without them, there would no landscape, let alone blossoms.The artistic process is, in many ways, quite similar; artists rarely make front-page news, and art funding is often the first to go when budget cuts are on the table. But artists seed the ideas and innovations that keep society evolving.\"Our ideas will pollinate the online world,\" says one line in Inspiration Pollination's mission statement. Oliva elaborated in an email to The Huffington Post: \"In a way, there is a natural symbiosis between pollinators and artists in the project.\"Not only does Oliva hope to see the environmental message spread far and wide, but the secondary message of the value of art. \"I've ... noticed a declining appreciation for fine art and the time it takes to create,\" she said.Through Inspiration Pollination, she hopes to \"gain exposure for artists and creators who are struggling to make it.\"With the project launched, thanks to contributions from Oliva and other artists such as Oliver Sanchez and Herb Williams, she's planning to establish Inspiration Pollination as a nonprofit fostering environmental art.So what next? Awareness, Oliva says, is only the first step. It's up to us, the audience, to put this into action. \"Buying organic, using less sprays and chemicals in your yard and proactively cultivating plants that pollinators need are all things that require effort and commitment,\" she explained.A tall order, but as with pollination, only many working together can make a change.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "This Friendship Between Bear And Man Is Still Going Strong", "text": "When most men get married, they choose a sibling, a childhood buddy, an old roommate or similarly close friend to stand up in the wedding as their best man. Casey Anderson chose a bear named Brutus.Brutus has been Casey's best friend ever since Casey rescued him from being euthanized at an overcrowded wildlife park when Brutus was just 5 months old. That's also when Casey founded the Montana Grizzly Encounter, an educational sanctuary where Brutus grew up. There, Brutus and Casey developed a deep emotional bond that Casey later described to \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2009.\"This connection goes beyond just taking care of Brutus,\" Casey told Oprah back then. \"They're very, very emotional animals... When he was a little baby, I was bottle-feeding him and I looked down in his eyes. He had a little tear in his eye. I just kind of chalked it up to [him] straining as he was sucking down the bottle. Several years later, Brutus got a bit of a bellyache. In his eyes, he had the same tear. At that moment, I realized that grizzly bears can feel the same emotions we do.\"Not only does Casey believe that Brutus experiences emotion, but he also told Oprah that his best friend can also sense -- and react -- when Casey is upset as well.\"I was having a hard time, was really upset about some things... I was crying,\" Casey said. \"I could see that he wanted to take the pain away from me. He came up to me very gently and nudged me. He just stood by me unconditionally and he listened to me and he was there when I was crying. It's truly what I needed from him. This relationship is a give-and-take.\"When he's not hanging out with Casey or enjoying the occasional visit inside Casey's home, Brutus spent his days frolicking around the sanctuary. Despite Brutus' close interaction with a human, Casey said that Brutus gets along quite well with other bears.\"He actually has kind of a girlfriend,\" Casey said in 2009. \"She's kind of the tomboy-girl of the sanctuary. She's the only one that can really put up with him. He plays pretty rough.\"Still, it seems that no one can take the place of Casey in Brutus' life. The pair are still the best of friends, as Casey tells \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\" in the above video. Brutus is now 13 years old, and he's still living at the Montana Grizzly Encounter.\"Brutus can't be in the wild because he didn't get to spend the first three years of his life with his wild mother,\" Casey explains. \"That's when bears in the wild learn everything they need to know to survive.\"Since Brutus and Casey's 2009 appearance on \"The Oprah Show,\" the Montana Grizzly Encounter has rescued two more bears, bringing their rescue total to seven grizzlies.\"Brutus has got a lot of new friends,\" Casey says. \"We just recently rescued a little orphan grizzly bear from Alaska named Bella. She's been a lot of fun.\"For as close as Casey and Brutus are, Casey is very clear about taking precautions when they interact.\"When I interact with Brutus, I certainly am very careful... I definitely don't treat him like a pet. He's a grizzly bear,\" Casey says.Casey isn't just careful for his own sake; he also recognizes what an injury could mean for the mission of grizzly rescue and education.\"If something happens to me, then everything that I'm trying to teach basically is canceled. It goes away. I'm just some fool that got too close to a grizzly bear,\" Casey says. \"So, that's part of my responsibility in having this relationship: to never forget that, no matter how much I love him, how much of a best friend he is to me, he's a grizzly bear.\"They've been together for more than a decade, and Casey sees their friendship lasting decades more.\"Bears can live to be 30, 40 years,\" he says. \"[It's] quite some time that we'll be sticking together.\"\"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\" returns with new episodes on Saturday, Sept. 19, at 10 p.m. ET.

ALEC is a major force behind the scenes in the effort to stall official policies that would combat climate change. Shell's extraction from ALEC is part of a larger ongoing effort to position the company as concerned about the environment, responsible, and supportive of efforts to mitigate climate change.Don't believe it for a second.This may seem like stating the obvious; however, Shell has gone to great lengths to greenwash its image. They have a climate blogger. The top item on their website's main menu is \"Environment and Society.\" They use words like \"responsible\" and \"sustainability\" all over their public communications to make it seem like they care about the environment and deserve a seat at the table in climate discussions.Despite all the pretty environmentally friendly sounding rhetoric, though, Shell has no plans to stop enriching itself while pumping carbon into the atmosphere. Take it from the company itself, in its own most recent annual report:\"Our strategy seeks to reinforce our position as a leader in the oil and gas industry...\"It doesn't get more explicit than that.Shell wants its investors to know that it's going to continue to fight its way to the top of the polluter pile and make a fortune while defiling the planet.And, while it's drilling operations in the Arctic are getting all the media attention, Shell brags to its investors that it has brought on a mind-boggling number of fossil fuel extraction operations last year, including 4 deep-water drilling sites, two of which are off the U.S. Gulf Coast.\"In Malaysia, first oil was produced from the Shell-operated Gumusut-Kakap deep-water development (Shell interest 29%). Peak production of around 135 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) is expected. Work on the gas injection facilities is continuing.Shell will be extracting roughly 305 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day from just these 4 deepwater sites. For comparisons sake, BP's Deepwater Horizon platform that caused the 2010 disaster in teh Gulf was gushing at a rate of 53,000 barrels per day just before they finally capped it.In total, Shell reports that it produced more than 3 million barrels of oil equivalents in 2014.Shell remains one of the dirtiest, corrupt and dangerous companies ever known, and no amount of green-washing can hide that simple fact.Shell's extraction from ALEC doesn't signal a new environmental conscientiousness dawning at the company. It represents only that the company wanted to neutralize its exposure in the public-relations nightmare that is ALEC, as well as an effort to forestall strong climate-change-focused measures from being adopted at upcoming international meetings by portraying itself and its industry as responsible, reasonable and concerned about our future.Shell is none of those things. Its own corporate documents prove it. It remains one of the most contemptible organizations in the history of humankind, and activists should not back off one inch in the fight against their depredations.

From fueling development around the world to a dangerous, dirty mineral in steep decline.Coal is a dead man walking because of two fundamental reasons: the revelation of the true cost of its deadly pollution and the booming clean energy economy. Both reasons disproportionately impact the Latino community.According to a study conducted in 2011 by several universities, including Harvard, the annual cost of coal in the US, from extraction to combustion to disposal and storage is up to $500 billion. This includes health, environmental and economic costs, of which the coal industry does not pay a single penny. It drops all those externalities on the rest of us, including you and your family.The Atlantic magazine has just published an article revisiting the study by interviewing one of its authors, Jonathan Buonocore, a Harvard research fellow. The conclusion is that the estimates from four years ago could have fallen dramatically short of reality. Originally, the report indicated that the coal industry's annual health care costs across the world almost hit the $200-billion mark.Buonocore acknowledges that back in 2011 they had a limited understanding of the true scope of climate change caused by coal and that they used a key factor --the EPA's Social Cost of Carbon-- which turned out to be painfully low. In fact, a recent study by Stanford University reveals such a cost is six times higher.Buonocore's figures the true coal costs are up to three times as high as the initial estimates, which has turned clean energy into a much more competitive option. One conclusion that has not changed, nevertheless, is that communities of color, such as Latinos, disproportionately suffer the impact of coal and the climate crisis it generates.A recent poll by Earthjustice and Green Latinos found that 78 percent of Latino voters have experienced the consequences of climate change in their communities, and that 82 percent are worried or very worried about it.The survey sends a severe warning to anyone who would ignore the concerns of Latinos over pollution and the climate crisis in favor of the agenda of big polluters. Larger percentages of voters consider water quality (90%) and conservation (86%), and the reduction of air pollution (85%) more important than immigration reform (80%).Coal's future indeed looks bleak among my community, as a whopping 84 percent of Latino voters support that the U.S. government mandate increases in clean energy sources, like solar and wind.And that is precisely what the Obama administration's recent Clean Power Plan does. The initiative will reduce carbon emissions from coal-burning plans by 32 percent by 2030 in relation to 2005 levels. The plan offers several options to each state to reach those goals, but in general terms, it does kick the door wide open for a clean energy economy to substitute dirty coal in our country.Shocking no one, the coal industry and its lackeys in Washington predicted the plan would trigger all sorts of economy cataclysms. The truth is 70 percent of Americans support the plan, which will avoid 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks and 1,700 heart attacks every year.The alternative to fighting the climate crisis is unthinkable. According to a study by Citigroup, inaction would cost some $44 trillion by the year 2060.Fortunately, the world is tuning out the lamentations of this incredibly shrinking mineral.Javier Sierra is a Sierra Club columnist.

A mounted head or showing off your wealth is apparently more valuable than a species threatened with extinction.Who, as yet, has failed to hear of Cecil, the magnificent black-maned lion brutally killed and decapitated by Walter Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota or as he is now known, the most hated man on the Internet. The Internet exploded with outrage over this so called \"hunt\" and Palmer fled for the hills and has just resurfaced. For those of us whose circle of care encompasses creatures like Cecil, it was an appalling act of unnecessary violence and one that I was glad people were outraged over, even Zimbabwe called for Palmer's extradition to face charges.Meanwhile, a lone hiker, walking without any protection in Yellowstone National Park was mauled, killed and apparently half eaten by a 20-year-old Grizzly bear mother known affectionately as Blaze. She had two cubs with her at the time. Blaze is now dead, her cubs heading for a life of imprisonment in a zoo. Blaze was another \"celebrity\" animal and much loved to all that had the good fortune to have studied, photographed and otherwise \"known\" her. A grandmother bear, she had given birth to many litters of cubs and according to a very moving tribute by photographer Sam Parks, had never been aggressive to humans previously.Yellowstone Park Services showed the required amount of contriteness about killing Blaze. And, with that apologetic diplomacy reserved for when humans just have to do the \"necessary evil\" they are obviously expecting all things Blaze to blow over and for the tourist business to carry on as usual. The troubling fact is, that paying the ultimate penalty for \"interfering\" with humans is not an unusual outcome for many animals living in our national parks.Take the iconic bison for instance; if they should happen to wander outside of park boundaries, and what animal understands boundaries, they are systematically shipped to slaughter. The actual number of bison sent to slaughter each year in Yellowstone Park is hard to track as the numbers differ depending on the source revealing a rather dark side of the national park service \"industry.\"Across the other side of the world, the Sumatran rhino was just declared extinct in the wild in Malaysia due to habitat loss and poaching. That means only one hundred of that particular species remain alive on this planet. Our animals are going extinct due to one thing and one thing only, MAN.We are facing the sixth mass extinction, but people like Palmer are still allowed to pay top dollar to hunt endangered animals. Park Services like Yellowstone are still allowed to prioritize tourism over animal's lives.What we need is a profound shift in our way of thinking and to eradicate speciesism. Our park services need to be lead by conservationists, not hunters and, if there is zero evidence to suggest that once a bear has killed a human it will start rampaging the countryside seeking human flesh, remove the human danger and not the animal one. If people are risking their lives for a selfie... well... so be it. The animal should not pay the price.If we don't, it's not too far-fetched to say that the time of the human race will be over shortly along with the animals we have brutally slaughtered along the way to pay for fake medicine and symbols of wealth. Our exaggerated belief that humans are the epicenter of the universe is just about to get its own attitude adjustment."}, {"title": "Environmental Groups Threaten To Sue EPA Over Fracking Wastewater Rules", "text": "WASHINGTON -- A coalition of environmental groups is threatening to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for not implementing new regulations on the disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations.The organizations -- which include the Environmental Integrity Project and the Natural Resources Defense Council -- will file a lawsuit if the EPA does not issue rules explaining where and how oil and gas drillers should deal with the water left over from their operations, they told the agency on Wednesday.Hydraulic fracturing, often called fracking, uses a high-pressure stream of water, sand and chemicals to tap in to oil and gas reserves within rock formations. The environmental groups are concerned about wastewater injected into the ground -- an estimated 2 billion gallons a day, according to industry estimates -- and cite recent research linking wastewater injection sites to increased seismic activity in some parts of the United States. They also worry about the practice of spreading wastewater on fields and roads to deal with dust and drought, and about the lack of structural requirements for storing wastewater in landfills or ponds.Wastewater from fracking operations has been found to include carcinogens and radioactive components, they say.\"Oil and gas waste is extremely dangerous -- yet the EPA admitted decades ago that federal rules are inadequate to protect the public,\" said Matthew McFeeley, an attorney at the NRDC, in a statement. \"Toxic waste should not be sent to run-of-the-mill landfills, sprayed on our roads and fields, or stored in open air pits.\"The coalition wants the EPA to review and revise how it handles this wastewater under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs waste disposal. They say that while the RCRA requires the agency to review regulations at least every three years, it has been more than 25 years since oil and gas waste rules have been updated.If the EPA does not take action on fracking waste within 60 days, the coalition says it will file a lawsuit.\"We will review the Notice of Intent and any related information submitted to EPA,\" agency spokeswoman Laura Allen told The Huffington Post in an email."}, {"title": "Finally, Some Good News About the California Drought", "text": "The California drought continues to drag on but there could be a silver lining, or two.Before the impossible San Francisco real estate market, Silicon Valley and the drought, California was known for something a little sweeter: wine. With the drought bringing less water to fields, vintners are thrilled to say that wine grape quality has never been better. In fact, the 2014 wine grape harvest produced one of the best vintages this decade, according to the Wine Institute. Plants and fruits are actually thriving in the \"deficit irrigation\" (reduced H2O) environment.\"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" said U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns.Napa Valley grapes aren't the only place fruit has gotten sweeter. In early findings on experiments performed by a group of USDA scientists, deficit irrigation (DI), produced either equal to better quality fruit besides grapes after two under-watered years.California peach farmer David \"Mas\" Masumoto, did his own experiment with DI and claims that his fruit bursts with flavor. Masumoto told the LA Times, \"I realize all these years I've been pumping them up with fertilizer and water to try to get them artificially big.\"In a study on the Wonderful Pomegranate Trees, a Fresno, California team led by researcher Tiziana Centofanti and USDA soil scientists Gary Banuelos, observed that the crops were smaller after two years of 35 percent less water, but showed no significant negatives in quality, taste or health benefits.And there may be even more good news coming from the tech industry. Silicon Valley has been historically silent when talking about inserting money into solutions for the drought, but they may be coming around and coming to the rescue, especially young, innovative startups.San Francisco-based company Imagine H2O hosts anti-drought tech competitions so residents can better understand just how much water they're using.PowWow Energy, a young startup, developed the use of gathering electricity data from basic smart meters installed on the water pumps that can signal pump leaks and send a text notification to the farmer. This would prevent any water from being lost which increases reserve efficiency.OnFarm launched a data management software, which includes tools for water management. Through the software, farmers can utilize analytics from real-time soil moisture to irrigation scheduling and more.Two-year-old CropX uses sensors to aid in helping farmers designate where the most useful location for water can be put to use, as to avoid waste. Differing terrain of farmland and fields require different levels of watering dependent on their elevation and relation to the cold or hot weather.The tech giants have also begun showing increasing interest. Google, Apple and Facebook have all pledged to adopt large amounts of clean energy to power their data centers, and the Farmer's Business Network recently raised $15 million from Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and DBL Investors for its social network which would allow farmers to collaborate with each other on field, crop and water issues including irrigation tools and weather information to increase yield.Given, the bad news concerning the drought may outweigh the good. Wine and apps aren't a solution to the bigger problem, but a little optimism during these dry times can't hurt."}, {"title": "Interview With UN Climate Change Report Author: \"Avarice Has Overcome Fear\"", "text": "\"In September, a few decades from now, our rich, colorful planet will display to a traveler in space only one white polar ice cap instead of two. There could hardly be a more portent symbol of what human beings are doing to our climate than the destruction of one of the Earth's ice caps.\"That's according to John Broome, one of the lead authors on the United Nation's latest blockbuster climate report:\"Since its cause is principally our burning of fossil fuel, it should make us fear what might be the next result of continuing in the same way. But, avarice has overcome fear. The surrounding nations see the retreat of ice as an opportunity to extract from beneath the Arctic Ocean yet more supplies of oil and gas to burn,\" writes the White's professor of moral philosophy at Oxford University in 'Climate Matters.'Temperatures in the Arctic are rising twice as fast as the global average.That's because the Arctic is far more sensitive to climate change than the rest of the world. When sunlight falls on snow and ice, it is reflected back into space. But, when it falls on water, that energy is absorbed. Since the 1970's, a third of the Arctic's summer ice has retreated to leave vast stretches of water.And, to make matters worse, there are vast stores of methane gas that are currently trapped in the permafrost underneath that ice. Triggering its release could be \"catastrophic,\" says the greying philosopher. Methane is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas which has the power to exacerbate global warming 25-fold.But, warming temperatures mean that some of it is has already started to escape. Acccording to Broome, \"there is enough methane there to destroy\" the entire human race. And, the terrifying thing is: we may have \"already passed that tipping point.\"Having had teaching posts at Oxford, Stanford and Princeton University, Broome was one of 800 authors who contributed to the UN's latest blockbuster climate series. At his home near the southern English coast, he says that \"the message that comes out of these reports, although very conservative, is actually rather frightening.\"According to the UN, our planet is currently on track to warm by four degrees Celsius before the turn of this century. Such a temperature rise will usher in changes not seen since the last Ice Age.Five years ago, world leaders vowed to restrict the warming of our planet to two degrees Celsius, concluding that this was the upper \"safe limit\". But, according to Broome, \"there is no scientific basis for the 2C target. It was dreamt up a German climatologist in the 1990's, and it kind of caught on.\"Citing James Hansen, NASA's former top climate scientist, Broome says that 2C of warming will lead to significant ice loss in both Greenland and Antarctica, ushering in a six meter sea level rise which would inundate major cities such as London, New York and Hong Kong.His warning comes less than three months before world leaders gather in Paris to strike a make-or-break deal to pull our planet back from the brink of catastrophic climate change. Scientists say that the sum total of the bids tabled thus far will only postpone dangerous warming by a few years.But, according to Broome, president Barack Obama's recent pledge to slash emissions from the energy sector by 32%  by 2030 is some cause for optimism: \"If the US does something strong, it may be that other countries will be persuaded to act as well.\"Yet, at other times, he is more pessimistic: \"The French appear to be more concerned about getting an agreement, than a worthwhile agreement. So, that may mean reaching for whatever agreement there is. And, what there is is the agreement between the United States and China.\"Last November, Obama vowed that America will cut its carbon pollution by over a quarter over the next ten years. And, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pledged that his nation's greenhouse gases will peak by 2030.Although the world's second largest economy has been criticized for not going far enough, Broome says that as China is still developing, it is entitled to make emissions. It still has 100 million people living in chronic poverty, living on less than $400 a year:\"Moreover, China is making a lot of these emissions for the sake of other poeple. They're making emissions to build products for people in rich nations to consume. So, a better way of judging this is by looking at the goods that create the emissions, rather than the countries that are making the emissions.\"According to Broome, as rich nations are historically responsible for the climate crisis, they have a moral duty to compensate poor nations already suffering at the hand of climate change. In his book, he cites the low rising Pacific islands of Tuvalu as an example:\"The Tavaluans have contributed virtually nothing to climate change. Yet, owing to rising sea levels, the islands may become uninhabitable within a few decades. But, the threat of homelessness has been visited on them by profligate rich nations far away.\"And soon, innocent people all over the world will find their lives similarly threatened.According to one report, climate change will cause one million deaths by 2030. And, \"since the killing will continue for decades, tens of millions will be killed in total,\" says Broome.In order to temper such a destructive fate, Broome adopts the UN line that all nations must emit zero emissions by 2100.That means that the much celebrated G7 pledge  to phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century is \"not ambitious enough:\"The G7 must have negative emissions by then, and be zero sometime before that. We are very very far from what needs to be done.\"Negative emissions mean sucking some carbon dioxide up out of the atmosphere. This can involve fairly benign means such as planting vast forests of trees. But, it can also involve more nefarious measures such as spraying the stratosphere with sulfur dioxide in order to reflect the sun's rays back into space.According to one report, this could usher in devastating regional effects which could condemn millions of people in the tropics to severe drought. Broome says:\"It sounds horrifying to me, and one of the worrying things is that it is really quite cheap. So, any country could just start doing this. I heard rumors that China has already started. But, you wouldn't actually know. It certainly wouldn't be announced.\"According to Broome, what we urgently need is a carbon tax.At present, anyone is allowed to pollute our \"common\" atmosphere for free. Instead, fossil fuel companies should be taxed for all the carbon that they take out of the ground. And, individuals should be taxed for all the carbon that their purchases contain: \"This figure needs to be the monetary value of harm that is caused by emitting a tonne of carbon,\" says Broome.And to make sure that everyone benefits, \"the revenue that is raised can be used to reduce income tax.\" It can also be used to \"buy off opposing political interests\" like the fossil fuel companies:\"A just outcome involves vested interests losing to people they have been harming all this time. But, I don't think that is obtainable. So, I think that we'll have to pay them off. It's the only way that we're actually going to get anything done about climate change.\""}, {"title": "Foal With All The Smooth Moves Redefines 'Hot To Trot'", "text": "Have you ever seen a horse moonwalk?Neither have we, but this foal comes awfully close.Unlike pop star Michael Jackson, who picked up his smooth moves with plenty of hard work, Paso Fino horses like this one take more of a Lady Gaga approach: They're \"born this way.\"According to Oklahoma State University, Paso Fino horses are prized for their remarkably smooth, stable gait, which is the result of genetics -- not training.\"These are not trained movements, but are natural to the horse from the moment of its birth,\" OSU's website notes. \"Artificial training aids are not necessary to bring about this genetically inherent gait.\"Here's what that gait can look like once the horses are adults, after a bit of training:(According to Horse Illustrated, a Paso Fino has plenty of other walking styles.

Yet savvy travelers know the country actually consists of  two main islands: the North and the South.New Zealand's North Island is a hub for Maori culture, a hotspot for scuba divers and home to the cosmopolitan cities of Auckland and Wellington. But as it turns out, New Zealand's sensationally beautiful and significantly less populous South Island is a sprawling, rugged paradise many tourists have shockingly failed to appreciate.Polynesian tribes were the first to inhabit the South Island, long before Dutch explorer Abel Tasman rediscovered the land in 1642 and they were subsequently called Maori. Currently, the South Island's population is about one-third of the North's, but what it lacks in human capital, it more than makes up in natural beauty: The South Island is home to nine national parks (one named for Tasman), and offers encounters with dolphins, penguins, whales and birds. Small fishing villages dot the coast, and all around you'll find stunning peaks, oceans, volcanoes, glaciers, fjords and snow-dusted Southern Alps.\"There is more to discover [on the South Island] than probably any place on Earth,\" photographer Antony Harrison, whose images are shown here, told The Huffington Post.Adventuring is huge on the South Island: Glacier climbing, bungee jumping, hot air ballooning and skiing are popular with daring travelers. You'll find some of New Zealand's best \"walks,\" or scenic hiking trails, in the forests, mountains and riverbanks.Oh, and much of \"The Lord of the Rings\" series was shot here, too.It takes about three and a half hours to get to the South Island via ferries from the North Island that operate year-round. Alternatively, you can take a direct flight from the North Island or from nearby Australia. Happy travels!CORRECTION: A previous version of this post included a quote about East Cape, a place we stated was on South Island. In fact, East Cape is located on North Island. Language has been amended to avoid the implication that New Zealand and Australia are not separate countries.Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Smart, Comprehensive Approaches Will Reduce Methane Emissions", "text": "Each year, billions of cubic feet of natural gas -- enough to heat more than six million American homes -- are directly released or leaked by the energy sector into the atmosphere, wasting a valuable energy resource, threatening the health of our communities, and accelerating the impacts of climate change.The EPA recently took a significant step forward to rein in emissions from methane (the primary component of natural gas) by setting a reduction target and guidelines to help the energy sector deploy available technologies and improve practices at new methane-emitting facilities (our statement outlines support for this bold move).States across the country are ahead of the curve when it comes to reasonable programs to limit methane emissions in the energy sector, and we're already seeing good outcomes for workers, communities, and businesses from strong methane policies in states like Colorado and California. But EPA's proposed standards will help all states deploy best practices and technologies to combat unnecessary waste and pollution.While this week's announcement is promising, there are other sources of methane waste that need to be addressed if we want to keep natural gas in the system producing energy -- rather than spilling into the air we breathe. Existing facilities are often the worst emitters and need oversight, as well. In addition, there are more than 100,000 miles of leak-prone natural gas distribution pipes under our cities -- many dating back to the 19th century -- that leak natural gas at more than 50 times the rate of advanced pipe materials available and in use today.Not only do these old pipes waste gas, which consumers and businesses often end up paying for, but uncombusted methane has at least 25 times the climate change impact as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a century. The labor unions of the BlueGreen Alliance (a partnership of 10 national labor unions and 5 environmental organizations), whose members work throughout the natural gas industry, know firsthand that keeping gas in the system -- including distribution networks delivering gas to our homes and businesses -- means safer workplaces and a better environment for their families and communities. Every day, they work diligently toward that end.Therein lies economic opportunity. Last year, we released a report outlining the benefits to consumers, workers, and communities that are achievable if we were to accelerate natural gas distribution system upgrades. On average, it could take 30 years or longer to replace and repair the most vulnerable segments of the natural gas pipes under America's cities and towns. Speeding that timeline up to a decade, which is achievable using current policy and finance mechanisms, would spur:• $30 billion in GDP growth over 10 years;  • More than 250,000 more jobs created throughout the economy; • Consumer and business savings of $1.5 billion of gas otherwise wasted; • Prevention of an additional 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution (akin to taking 17 million cars off the road for an entire year).Reducing leaks in our natural gas distribution networks, along with broader efforts to keep gas in the system throughout the energy sector, offer ways to grow our economy and make it more efficient. American workers are already developing, manufacturing, and implementing technologies that prevent leaks and venting -- creating high-quality jobs and stimulating local economies -- all while reducing emissions that contribute to climate change. Reaching the administration's economy-wide goal of reducing methane emissions up to 45 percent over 10 years will ensure these technologies and practices are deployed at an even greater scale.Coupling the EPA's proposal with potential to upgrade the gas distribution networks serving our cities and towns, and preventing methane waste and leaks at existing energy facilities, provides wins all around -- employing American workers in safer workplaces, conserving energy resources, ensuring cleaner air, and averting climate change impact. On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of our labor union and environmental partners, the BlueGreen Alliance lauds this important step forward, and will continue working to keep natural gas in the system."}, {"title": "Baby Panda Dies At National Zoo", "text": "Well, this is heartbreaking: One of two baby pandas born on Saturday at the National Zoo has died.The smaller of the two cubs died on Wednesday shortly after 2 p.m., the zoo said in a news statement.The larger cub \"appears to be strong, robust, behaving normally and is with mother Mei Xiang,\" the statement read.Zoo employees had been trying to regularly allow each cub to nurse and get individual attention from its mother while the zoo's staff cared for the other one, but they weren't always successful. Mei was reportedly reluctant to give up the bigger cub for some time.The little one had been with its mother from Tuesday afternoon until Wednesday morning, but staff noticed that the cub had \"not increased in weight, appeared weaker and exhibited possible respiratory issues.\"Zoo staff gave the panda antibiotics, fluids and formula, along with respiratory support, but couldn't save its life.The smaller cub weighed just 79.8 grams, .19 pounds, at the time of its death. By contrast, its larger sibling weighed 137.7 grams, or .3 pounds, at its last weigh-in. The zoo says the larger cub appears to be doing well, but \"is still vulnerable and the risk remains high.\"Panda babies are almost impossibly small and fragile when they are born. Scientists believe their small size is an evolutionary adaptation to the giant panda's diet, which consists almost entirely of bamboo and doesn't provide much nutrition. It's more efficient for mother pandas to feed their infants with milk than to stay pregnant longer and grow bigger babies.According to the zoo, about 1 in 4 male pandas and 1 in 5 female pandas dies in its first year.The zoo says it will perform an autopsy on the baby panda, and results should be available in a few weeks.And, because you now deserve to see something cheerful and hopeful, here's a video of Mei with one of her babies on Monday:This story has been updated with additional information about the baby panda's death and more comments from National Zoo officials.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "MMA Fighter Offers Dog-Loving Steelers Fans A Way To Protest Michael Vick Joining The Team", "text": "Gordon \"Shotgun\" Shell is a retired mixed martial arts fighter with a second career as a vigilante dogfight buster, pit bull advocate and semi-professional Michael Vick objector.This week, Shell's been hearing from many former fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers who are unhappy that Vick -- an NFL quarterback who spent 18 months in jail in 2008 and 2009 for his role in an interstate dogfighting operation -- has been signed to a one-year contract with the team.So Shell, who is based in Detroit, decided to offer these folks something to make them feel a little better: a special anti-Vick shirt made up in Steelers colors.\"I'm going to offer free shipping to Pennsylvania residents so the shirts make it to the games,\" Shell told The Huffington Post.What's with the slogan, you may ask?About five years ago, Shell retired from fighting due to a serious heart condition.But he's offered to get back into the cage under one condition -- that Michael Vick joins him in a televised battle to raise money for animal welfare groups. Hence, \"Fight me Mike Vick!\"Shell has promised to call off his protests and encourage forgiveness if Vick pays this (potentially gory) penance.\"I think the public wants and needs blood to feel closure,\" Shell said. \"I just want a clean hard fight in a great event that can raise awareness and funds.\"For the last few years, Shell has been wearing and selling black-and-white versions of his T-shirts. He estimates he's sold about 4,000 so far. He uses the proceeds to buy things like bulletproof vests, which he wears for protection when he's out rescuing dogs.The new line of Steelers shirts launched on Wednesday, a day after it was announced that Vick would be joining the team. The quarterback's arrival has caused some longtime Steelers fans to sever their allegiance.\"I have been a Steelers fan since I was 9 years old, and I still have my very first little wool hat with the pompom on it,\" said Jean Keating, founder of a pit bull rescue group. \"It breaks my heart to not cheer for the black and gold, but my dogs are family and family comes first.\"The Pittsburgh nonprofit Hello Bully, which works with dogs that have been rescued from the fighting circuit, is urging people to call and email the Steelers and register their unhappiness that Vick is joining the team.Shell says he, too, is disappointed that Vick has re-emerged -- especially, he says, since \"I honestly thought he was done.\"But since Vick's not done, and the protesters aren't done, then neither is Shell -- and he's feeling creative.\"I think the new colors freshen the shirt,\" he said, \"and give it a strong meaning to disgruntled Steelers fans.\"UPDATE: 5:20 p.m. -- Chris Shigas, a spokesman for Vick, told HuffPost in an email that he thinks Vick has already raised plenty of awareness for animal welfare, in part by campaigning for legislation to make it a federal crime to attend an animal fight.\"I am proud of the work in the community that Michael Vick has accomplished,\" Shigas said.As for Shell's direct challenge, Shigas gave what seemed to be an oblique no.\"Many people have tried to make money from using Michael Vick’s name,\" he said. \"But threatening violence or cyberbullying is never acceptable.\"Have an animal story to share?

For many Americans, excursions to the national parks conjure up memories of family road trips, camp songs and hikes set in some of the country's most beautiful locales. Ken Burns called the parks, \"America’s best idea.\" Cue Woody Guthrie: \"This Land Is Your Land.\"But what's often left unmentioned is that for the parks to become the protected lands of public imagination, their prior inhabitants -- such as indigenous peoples and the rural poor -- had to be evicted.To shed light on this history and its perpetuation abroad, indigenous rights advocacy organization Survival International launched a new campaign this month called \"Stop the Con,\" protesting what it describes as the \"violent displacement\" of indigenous peoples in the name of conservation. The campaign aims to raise awareness about problematic conservation practices.The campaign began two weeks ago when Tesia Bobrycki, an environmental activist from California, scaled the monolithic granite face of Yosemite National Park's El Capítan and dangled from a rope 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor. Bobrycki had \"Stop the Con,\" written on her hand, which she proudly displayed to the Survival International cameraman stationed above her on the cliff’s edge.Bobrycki was calling attention to the fact that, long before Yosemite became a popular tourist destination, the Ahwahneechee Indians who resided in the region knew it as \"Ahwahnee,\" or \"gaping mouth-like place.\" During the Mariposa War in 1851, California soldiers \"discovered\" the valley while pursuing the AhwahneecheeThe soldiers expelled the Ahwahneechee and renamed their valley \"Yosemite.\" But the Ahwahneechee returned, and worked humiliating jobs entertaining tourists as \"Indian performers\" to remain in their homeland. The national park finally evicted the last of them and burned down their remaining homes in a fire-fighting drill in 1969.A spokesperson for the National Park Service referred request for comment to Yosemite National Park's communications department. A representative from Yosemite did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.Historian William Cronon began unearthing the forgotten stories of indigenous peoples in the 1980s, followed by others like Mark Spence and Karl Jacoby. Their writings revealed the displacement hidden within enduring romantic ideas about national parks.\"Conservation is used as a tool of colonialism,\" Jacoby told HuffPost. \"Conservation is basically trying to say that ‘We the state and the state bureaucracies, have the appropriate knowledge to manage the environment in the best way,\" rather than indigenous peoples and other prior inhabitants.Jacoby’s first book, Crimes Against Nature, draws on case studies from the Adirondacks, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone to demonstrate the history of displacement that underlies American conservation.\"In the 19th century, there is a very strong critique of native environmental practices in a lot of the conservation literature that you read,\" said Jacoby. \"The only way you can come in and say ‘We [the state] need to manage this space and manage the environment,’ is you have to in some ways present the current managers of it -- the native peoples -- as incompetent.\"Native peoples, like the Ahwahneechee, however, did not leave their homes in the parks of their own accord and often had to be removed and kept away from their homelands by force. The United States Army, for example, was stationed at Yellowstone from 1886 to 1918 to keep out indigenous peoples and others with the threat of violence.Jacoby said his scholarship isn't necessarily well-received by conservation advocates. \"My book has not made me very popular in environmentalist circles,\" he added with a laugh.Survival International points out that today, San people in Botswana, Baka people in southeastern Cameroon, and tribes in India’s tiger reserves face arrest, torture and even death as they try to maintain ancestral homes that are being coopted in the name conservationism -- a brand of exclusionary conservation first practiced in America, the group argues.\"All of this abuse that has been carried out in the name of conservation is still going on,\" Michael Hurran, spokesman for Survival International, told HuffPost. \"It’s high time that it stopped. That’s what this ‘Stop the Con’ campaign is trying to do.\"The problem with a neutered history of national parks and conservation, Survival International argues, is that it fails to create the policies that protect the environment.\"Often the real drivers of environmental destruction go unaddressed, things like logging, mining and political corruption, while the lives of the most defenseless people and the least responsible people are ruined or made impossibly difficult,\" Hurran said. \"We are calling for a new model of conservation, a new kind of conservation, that works not against but with tribal peoples who are the best conservationists and guardians of the natural world.\"The first step for the organization is to spark a public debate during the park’s centennial year.\"We are trying to stimulate a really public debate about this to get every normal person talking about this and thinking about this -- both the dark history of conservation and what’s happening now, and what conservation could look like in the future,\" Hurran said."}, {"title": "Monsanto's Bid To Become A Pesticide Giant Is, Thankfully, Dead", "text": "Monsanto's bid to buy pesticide rival Syngenta is officially dead.The biotech seed giant said Wednesday that its Swiss competitor rejected its offer for the fourth time -- this time, for about $47 billion -- because it failed to meet Syngenta's \"financial expectations.\"In a statement, Monsanto said it plans to focus on its stand-alone business, though it's unclear whether the company will consider making a fifth, larger bid. A spokesman was not immediately available to comment.\"Without a basis for constructive engagement from Syngenta, Monsanto will continue to focus on its growth opportunities built on its existing core business to deliver the next wave of transformational solutions for agriculture,\" the company stated.The merger would have transformed the agricultural business by creating an industry Goliath out of the two firms, allowing Monsanto to gain a foothold in the chemical industry it's spent the last two decades distancing itself from. Syngenta's vast portfolio of pesticides would have made Monsanto into a one-stop shop for farmers.As an added perk, merging with Syngenta would have cleared the way for Monsanto to slash its tax bill by moving its headquarters to the U.K., where corporations are taxed at a lower rate.\"This has been quite the soap opera,\" Patty Lovera, assistant director at the food industry advocacy group Food & Water Watch, told The Huffington Post.Both companies are already known for their aggressive patenting of seeds and chemicals, as well as their vicious treatment of critics questioning the healthfulness of their products.Founded in 1901 in St. Louis as a producer of chemicals such as Agent Orange, Monsanto was dubbed the \"world's most evil company\" in 2013. Notoriously litigious, the firm has sued everyone from farmers who save its seeds -- the company ferociously defends its patents -- to European food regulators who refuse to legalize its products.Syngenta, too, has sued to protect its so-called \"Terminator\" patents, which force farmers to buy new seeds every year. By saving or replanting old seeds, the farmer violates the company's patent rights. Moreover, the firm has been plagued by accounts of its own unscrupulous behavior. Last year, The New Yorker profiled biologist Tyrone Hayes, whose research found that Atrazine -- an herbicide sold by Syngenta -- caused sexual abnormalities in amphibians. Hayes believed the company was surveilling him.\"Syngenta was pretty infamous for its treatment of folks who dared to question its chemicals and Monsanto is pretty well known for its practices,\" Lovera said. \"Having that entity get even bigger is not the direction we want to move in.\"Syngenta did not respond to a request for comment."}, {"title": "I Am Mad", "text": "I am mad. So very mad. No, that doesn't begin to describe it. I am pissed. I am angry. I am irate. I am incensed. I am outraged. I am enraged. I am livid. I am GODDESS DAMN FURIOUS.\"All men are created equal,\" states the Declaration of Independence. From the very beginning, women were denied equality in this country. It has taken over two centuries for women to win the right to vote, to have alleged protection under the law, to earn as much as 68 and 77 cents on the dollar (depending on our skin color) that men are paid, and to gain control over our own bodies and destinies.  And now, nearly 250 years later, we are seeing our rights, our freedoms, our healthcare being stripped away, one by one, by mean spirited, misogynistic, right wing religious uber-conservatives. In 2015 there is still no Equal Rights Amendment. Women are still not equal under the law.  Of course I am angry! How can I not be? I am not angry only about the injustice perpetrated upon women in this country, but also on all the women and girls everywhere in the world who are abused, exploited, enslaved, brutalized and murdered -- untold thousands as newborns -- simply because they are female. Better believe I am angry. Aren't you?  My anger is far reaching and inclusive. Every virulent expression -- be it verbal, physical, cultural, political or armed -- of religious hatred, xenophobia, racism, classism, ageism, homophobia sets my teeth on edge. As does witnessing shockingly common displays that range from disregard to disrespect to downright mean, nasty disdain directed at folks with abundant body fat or those who are differently abled.  Every fracking contract, pipeline, oil spill, contaminated river, felled forest, wild fire, melting iceberg, radiation leak, gmo apple, dead bee, poached animal, endangered species, and cancer patient, stirs my wrath. Every hungry, homeless, terrified, traumatized refugee and GI incites my furious, protective tiger mother ire.  My partner often questions why I watch the news if it makes me so mad. Because it is important for me to know what is going on around me. I do not want to be deaf and blind to ignorance or violence, even if the shrill blare and horrendous images are painful. I want to feel that pain, to feel part of that pain. I want to accept any culpability on my part for perpetuating pain and peril through disregard, denial, laziness or depression. Depression is the flip side of anger.  \"Anger is energizing. The opposite of anger is depression,  which is anger turned inward,\" (Gloria Steinem).  Most women are uncomfortable with anger. We are frightened of anger directed at us for very real reasons. But we are most scared of our own anger. We have been raised to be good girls, after all. To be sugar and spice and everything nice. Yeah, right.  Anger is a natural emotion and needs to be honored and expressed, lest it eat us up from the inside. Anger contains a huge amount of energy, which can be converted to powerful creativity, positive purpose, and proactive change.  I think of my anger as righteous indignation. It spurs me to react, to respond, to resist, to rebel. My fury is the fuel that fires my fiercely impassioned efforts toward the defense of Mother Earth and all of Her exquisite creations and creatures.Now is the time for us women to acknowledge and explore our stature and our strength. It is high time to speak our truth, walk our talk, and put our money where our mouth is. We have held back long enough. Starting here, starting now, we must claim our rightful duties as leaders, as healers, as visionaries. We have the whole world in our hands.Hell may have no fury like a woman scorned, but women standing together side by side, autonomous, proud, and empowered can create heaven on Earth!\"There will be no heaven unless we make it,\" (Florence Nightingale)."}, {"title": "Horses With 3-Foot-Long Hooves Freed From 15-Year-Long Hell", "text": "Early last Friday, three horses were found on a private farm by field service officers with the Humane Society of Washington County (HSWC), a nonprofit organization that contracts with Washington County, Maryland to provide animal control services."}, {"title": "Parrots Don't Make Good Pets - Get a Cat Instead", "text": "This question originally appeared on Quora, the best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.Answer by John Buginas:This applies to macaws and other large parrot-like birds.My wife has a macaw she got about 30 years ago as a baby bird. The bird adores her. The bird is pretty and has some charm. It is very cute, especially when she and my wife interact. I met my wife six years ago. I've tried for about six years to win her bird over. It's not working.Some things you may want to consider:Large birds can live a very, very long time — 50-70-plus years is not uncommon. Unlike dogs or cats, they don't die in a few years. Unless you are 5, your bird could well outlive you.It may be hard to find the bird a suitable home when you die, because a parrot may bond well with only one person. This means it sees that person as a partner, and it may not get along with other family members, which means it may bite other family members. Big birds bite hard.Parrots are very smart and have a long memory. They can be trained using positive reinforcement techniques. Some birds can be trained to talk or do tricks. They are also known to train their owners.These birds require a modest amount of daily care. You must, of course, provide food and water daily and regularly clean their cages. They generally keep themselves pretty clean; our macaw enjoys a shower now and then. I do most of the work with my wife's bird; it's less work than my dogs, by far.They are also social animals and will not appreciate being stuck in a cage in a corner when you tire of them. If they are unhappy, they will squawk. If they are very unhappy, they may pull out their feathers.As part of their social behavior, they squawk loudly for about 30 minutes a day — very loudly. It's normal behavior. It drives me and our two dogs out of the room. They also will squawk to get what they want. (They are smart and can train humans!) For example, our macaw trained me to bring her food when she squawked. This was because I brought her some yummy lettuce a few times when she squawked. I thought she might be hungry. (I didn't yet know that they instinctively squawk every day at sundown for 30 minutes.) She then started squawking endlessly and at all hours until I brought food. The only way we could break the habit was to completely ignore the squawking for about an hour until she gave up. It took several days of this for the habit to be broken.I've been trying to charm my wife's bird. I made a plan of working with her frequently. I gave her treats for good behavior. I talked to her pleasantly and tried to play or otherwise engage with her. I was making some progress; I even got her to stand on my finger and take food. But I made one mistake. I bowed to the bird, which I didn't realize was a threatening bird gesture.Since then, the bird has continued to do little but threatening gestures toward me. She has snapped at me when I'm near the cage and bit me (hard) on my foot when it was out of the cage and I made the mistake of looking away from her.The way I reckon it, this bird will outlive me. I'm about 60, and I expect to live another 20-30 years. The bird will likely live another 40-50 years.* * *Answer by Rick Klugman, third-generation parrot caregiver:Parrots do not make good pets, and I strongly advocate against anyone who has no previous experience with the larger birds from getting one. My wife and I support several parrot rescue organizations, and they all tell the same sad tale. They are booked to capacity with birds that were given up by people who didn't know what they were getting themselves into or birds that have outlived their caregivers. My vet will even tell you sadder tales of coming into work and finding birds abandoned on her doorstep. She calls them \"dumps.\" Let me share with you some things to consider before thinking about bringing a parrot into your life.Parrots are not a novelty item. Not all parrots talk. If this is your reason for getting one, get a cat.Parrots are not domesticated animals. They are wild animals that have adapted to captivity. Unpredictability is to be expected. I have been bitten more times than I can remember by misreading a bird's intent. And these are the ones I've shared my life with for more than 30 years! A parrot bite can be severe enough to require medical attention. My wife and I have the scars to prove it.Parrots are exceptionally intelligent with the mental capacity of a 2-year-old human and share many of the same traits. They throw food. They throw tantrums. They bite. They scream for attention, loudly (a cockatoo scream is 100 db compared with 130 db for a jet engine at 100 feet). And they're not potty-trained.Because of their intelligence, they require constant interaction. I recommend at least eight hours a day. My wife gave up her career several years ago to be a full-time mom to our small flock and wouldn't have it any other way. If you ask her, she'll tell you it's a full-time job with plenty of overtime and no pay, but the rewards are great.When you're not entertaining them, they must be entertained. Toys aren't cheap, and you're going to need plenty of them. Most will run between $15-$20, and my cockatoo can reduce one to woodchips in very short order.Just like kids they require annual checkups. I can't overstress the importance of this. Parrots hide their illnesses extremely well, and by the time they become symptomatic it may already be too late. Your average vet bill for this starts at around $85 and goes up from there depending on whether your vet thinks further testing is in order. If they recommend it follow their advice. Bloodwork can run $300. If you can't afford this, get a cat. Also, make sure you visit an avian vet. Birds have an entirely different anatomy than dogs or cats, and you need a qualified avian vet who is familiar with their anatomy. My vet tells me there are only about 200 board-certified avian vets in the U.S., of which she is one, and I'm extremely lucky to have found her. She's amazing!Parrots have an extremely long lifespan. The larger the bird, the longer it lives. My other vet has a scarlett macaw that's confirmed to be at least 65 years old. If you're considering taking in a parrot, you'll be making a lifelong commitment. Are you willing to do this? If not, get a cat.If I still haven't dissuaded you, I implore you to adopt. As previously mentioned there are many rescue organizations looking to rehome birds willing to share their lives with you. Be prepared for a backround check with follow-ups. All responsible rescue organizations will have a very thourough screening process to avoid having a boomerang bird.Please give careful thought and do your homework before bringing home a feathered friend. In case you haven't figured it out yet, I'd rather you got a cat!Why do parrots make good pets? originally appeared on Quora.

With a population projected to grow up to 9.6 billion people over the next 35 years, a range of sectors and professions must confront the same question: How do we provide the quantity and quality of food necessary, let alone in a sustainable manner?While a focus on nutrients is important to create a food system that can sustain the future population, an equal emphasis should be placed on sustainable diets. And this piece is too often missing in discussions of nutrition. A macronutrient that often garners particular attention for its lack of sustainability is protein. This is an issue Forum for the Future is investigating with The Protein Challenge 2040. I recently attended a workshop for this Challenge where a diverse group of attendees looked at how system mapping can be utilized to optimize nutritional outcomes while reducing negative impacts of protein production, with a theme being sustainability.Sustainability must be a key factor when considering animal-source protein production methods. For example, the average meat consumption per capita is expected to grow to 50kg in 2015 from 42kg in 2010 because of increases in income and changes in dietary preference. Overall, animal-source protein demands are expected to grow by 72 percent between 2013 and 2050. Moreover, since livestock and poultry are fed plant-based diets, these animal-source proteins will compete with humans for grain foods.Two questions confront the intersection of food security and nutrition: Do achievable and sustainable food science innovations that can produce the required quality and quantity of protein to serve consumers worldwide, exist? And, can these innovations be scaled up for the 9.6 billion people worldwide by 2050?Protein, a macronutrient, contains essential amino acids that play many functional, structural, metabolic, and developmental roles in the body. Equally vital are micronutrients, the vitamins and minerals that the human body requires. The lack of optimal levels of macro- and micronutrients across the globe leads to what is called the triple burden of malnutrition. The triple burden refers to deficiencies in macro- and micronutrients, and to excessive intake that results in obesity. Global estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations tell us that 842 million are undernourished; 2 billion are micronutrient deficient; and, 1.4 billion adults are overweight, as of 2014. How will these malnutrition statistics change with the approaching protein sustainability problem?To explore this question, The Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science at the New York Academy of Sciences brought together leading researchers and innovators in a conference centered around the topic of the protein supply chain to discuss biodiversity, the role of agriculture in diets, the environmental impact of protein production, protein processing technologies, and innovations in the protein supply chain. A related podcast explores these issues.Will we recognize the food on our plates in 2050? Ultimately, the food may look (and taste) a little different, but if the nutrition, agriculture, economics, and social and behavioral sciences fields work together, we can create sustainable solutions that will enable us to proactively tackle malnutrition and create enough nutrient-rich food to serve the growing world demand. ​A version of this blog originally appeared on SecureNutrition #securenutrition, a World Bank Knowledge Platform on April 20, 2015."}, {"title": "Stolen Pug Goes Bananas When Reunited With Her Owner", "text": "Words may not be able to sum up this pooch's excitement at seeing her owner once again.Lola the pug, who lives in the town of Harlow in Essex, England, was recently reunited with her owner, Kate Witham, at Harlow Police Station after the pup had been stolen, according to the description from an Essex police YouTube video.

Recent studies showing the pronounced developmental effects of pre-mature neutering have many people thinking twice before cutting off their dog's testicles. I know I did.Last week, after reviewing the growing research against the invasive, organ-removing surgery, I took our youngest rescue, Gadzooks, to a Zeuterin clinic at Adopt-a-Dog in Armonk, New York. Zeuterin is an FDA-approved, non-surgical sterilization procedure for puppies ages 3-10 months. Proven to be both safe and effective, the injection is similar to receiving an inoculation and allows a dog to be back on their feet within an hour. There are generally few complications, which are detailed below.Say what? That sounds a little too good to be true. If you're like me, you might be wondering: how does it work, and why haven't I heard of this procedure before? The photo below offer a quick clue. Study it on an empty stomach.Before we delve into the nitty gritty of sterilization methods, let's look back. Long before these practices were used on our pet populations, people used castration for everything from signaling victory in tribal conquest to marking status in ruling kingdoms. In 1778, Thomas Jefferson passed a bill in Virginia enacting castration as a penalty for certain crimes.Early observations of castrated men showed side-effects like reduced bone density, muscle mass, and body hair development. Many of the men were said to assume more serene dispositions but also claimed to have developed depression.But enough about us, what happens to castrated dogs?Interestingly, there are no legitimate scientific studies that demonstrate the behavioral effects of castration on dogs. A lot is assumed. Intact dogs are said to roam and mark and be more aggressive. While some statistics show that 80 percent of all dogs found on the side of highways are intact males (presuming they've roamed from home), new research shows that aggression--which has always been the strongest selling point for testicular removal--may actually be worse after the procedure, which has been shown to increase anxiety levels. While male-to-male dog aggression is more pronounced in intact dogs, it's unclear if training and early socialization would help reduce those tendencies. All this, and to muddy the water even more, female dogs also mark, roam and show aggression, so go figure.On the other hand, there are health risks involved with neutering, especially when this surgery is performed on dogs who haven't reached physical maturity (1-2 years of age). The AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) informs that this procedure \"can result in increased risk of health problems such as incontinence and some types of cancer.\"Other health risks that have been linked to studies targeting certain breeds  where premature castration--and the consequent elimination of the vital hormone, testosterone - include:• bone cancer (osteosarcoma) • prostate cancer • hypothyroidism (under-active thyroid)  • obesity • urinary tract cancers • heart cancers (cardiac haemangiosarcoma)  • orthopaedic (bone) disorders • adverse reactions to vaccinations • senilityIf castrating a dog has this many adverse side effects why is it still happening? Most importantly, why are our country's leading rescue organizations sterilizing their puppies as young as seven weeks of age, risking sedation and removing organs that produce a major growth hormone (testosterone) -- especially now that there is a viable alternative? While one can understand the urgency to stave off the sad overpopulation issue, don't we owe our beloved pets a little more? These are not farm pigs we're talking about--these are our dogs who, in most households, are revered like children.Consider the Options As studies continue to show the adverse health effects of traditional castration, two other organ-sparing procedures have emerged:  • Vasectomy, a surgery commonly used to sterilize people, involves snipping the vesicular tubes that transport sperm during breeding.  • Chemical Sterilization involves injecting a disruptor compound into each testicle. Ark Sciences manufactures and distributes Zinc Gluconate, an FDA-approved serum.I spoke to my friend and colleague, LA's premier veterinarian and TV personality, Dr. Jeff Werber, who regularly practices both traditional and alternative sterilization procedures, i.e. Zeuterin. \"Neutering eliminates all but trace amounts of testosterone from the dog's system; Zeuterin, while it effectively sterilizes a dog, only reduces testosterone by about 50%.\" As a means for population control, he feels both are effective. The key differences are that neutering requires anesthetizing, \"the most dangerous part of any procedure,\" whereas Zeuterin, an in-office procedure, is fast, does not require full sedation and is thus less expensive. He finds the new practice of pre-mature neutering in our shelter system puzzling. \"Zeutering is the answer here! You sterilize the puppy using a non-invasive, safe procedure that will not handicap their physical growth! Down the road, if the dog develops behavior problems related to increased testosterone - like marking, roaming, or aggressive tendencies - you can neuter then.\"Again the question: Why wouldn't everyone--from the AVMA to our country's leading humane organizations - jump at effective, organ-sparing, hormone-salvaging options for population control?   While the AVMA has taken notice, Dr. Douglas G Aspros, a former president and spokesperson for the AVMA, says they're reluctant to adopt non-surgical neutering procedures, such as Zeuterin, as their primary method of sterilization until more research has been completed on its long-term effects. He, on behalf of the AVMA, suggests dog lovers speak to their veterinarian regarding the best option for their pet.After mindfully considering my options and speaking to my veterinarian, I chose the FDA-approved Zinc Gluconate sterilization, known as Zeuterin, for my own dog.  Upon arriving at the clinic, I was able to observe the procedure and speak with representatives from Ark Sciences, who both distributes and certifies doctors to administer the serum, as well as the attending veterinarians (Dr. Mortsakis, NY Vet Practice, and Dr. Carr, Greenwich Animal Hospital). Handing Gadzooks' leash to the technician, I watched the procedure as both a fascinated journalist and a compassionate dog mommy.After inducing light sedation, Dr. Ben Kagen, the preforming veterinarian from Adopt-a-Dog, measured each testicle to determine the dosage, then tenderly injected the sterilizing serum into the center of each globe. It took no longer than a traditional vaccination. Zinc is normally needed for maturation of sperm, but in the concentration used in the serum, it destroys the seminiferous tubules. Over 4-6 weeks, the healing process creates scar tissue that effectively blocks the movement of sperm outside of the testicle. Testosterone producing cells are spared and continue to produce testosterone for metabolic functions, although at lower.Photo by Bohdan AdianowyczAt the end of the procedure, a small tattoo - looking more like Harry Potter's lightening bolt than the intended \"Z\" - was imprinted on Zookie's abdomen. The technician then carefully reversed his sedation, explained that side effects could including grogginess, licking, and swelling at the injection or tatooed site, and sent us on our way.The next day, I phoned Sandeep Manchanda, a partner at Ark Sciences, to ask his opinion as to why this revolutionary method for effective sterilization was not more openly received, especially by rescue organizations. \"It's perplexing,\" he replied. \"After it was approved in 2014 we were expecting a lot of interest, especially within the humane organizations as a solution for population control. Their current practice is to neuter their male pups as early as 7 weeks of age, even though research is showing an increased risk of orthopedic issues, bone and other cancers as a result. Instead we got resistance. Concerns about aggressive behavior, even though it is not supported by existing research, is a big barrier. Lack of quick adoption of an FDA-approved procedure by influential organizations like Humane Alliance and ASPCA creates question marks in people's minds as well. We are assuming that studies comparing castration with Zeuterin will show the impact it can have.While questions and demand for research continue in the US, the same formula remains approved for dogs of all ages in Mexico, Bolivia, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Turkey. It is also approved for cats in Colombia.\"As research reveals the serious health conditions that result from castration (at any age), neutering is coming under review, with many of our country's leading veterinarian scientists and thinkers are taking a stand. Marty Becker, author of 22 books (3 New York Time best-sellers) who is referred to as \"America's Veterinarian,\" endorses Zeuterin - -the only product he has ever endorsed: \"Zeuterin...has the potential to revolutionize how we care for our dogs...and has to be a powerful weapon in the fight against pet overpopulation.\"Slowly, this and other organ-sparing procedures that allow dogs to maintain healthy levels of testosterone are gaining popularity, although concerned veterinarians still question the increased risk of adenomas (benign tumors), fistulae (cracks in the internal passageways) and testicular cancer. In reply, Zeuterin researchers report that in each case, the recurrence rates are so low that they are not worth the anesthetic risk for prevention. As for testicular cancer, the rates are at 2% and can be treated by castration 90% of the time. In comparison, neutering is shown to double or triple the overall cancer risk in other areas of the body.Tinkering with the body of any animal has consequences. While neutering has long been the salvation of domestication in the U.S. (versus European countries that view the procedure as cruel and inhumane), it's time to consider other options for sterilization.

Astronauts on the Apollo missions in the '70s found hardened beads of glass that were proof of these fiery geysers. But scientists were never quite sure exactly which volatile gas caused fountains -- until now.A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday finds that carbon caused the moon eruptions when it mixed with oxygen to form expanding carbon monoxide gas.\"The carbon is the one that is producing the large spectacle,\" Dr. Alberto Saal, associate professor of planetary sciences at Brown University and co-author of the new study, said in a statement.For the study, the researchers analyzed the glass beads collected during the Apollo missions and looked for any magma that might have been trapped inside them when they cooled. And -- voila -- the magma they found had traces of carbon monoxide in it.Since the researchers found much higher levels of carbon in the beads with trapped magma than in the moon's volcanic glass overall, they concluded that the carbon monoxide must have been responsible for the fire fountains, Space.com reported.The finding not only sheds new light on the moon's old fire fountains, but also serves as more evidence that our planet and its satellite have a lot in common. The amount of carbon detected in the beads was very similar to the amount found in volcanic rocks on Earth.This new study adds to previous findings that the moon may have formed out of leftover debris when Earth was hit by a Mars-sized object.\"The volatile evidence suggests that either some of Earth’s volatiles survived that impact\" and helped create the moon, Saal said, \"or that volatiles were delivered to both the Earth and Moon at the same time from a common source — perhaps a bombardment of primitive meteorites.\"For the full story of how Earth got its moon, check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" episode below."}, {"title": "Newest Tasteless Halloween Costume: 'Cecil The Lion Killer Dentist'", "text": "Halloween is still more than two months away, but companies are gearing up with tasteless costumes.The Lion Killer Dentist costume costs $59.99, but that includes a severed lion's head and blood-splattered smock."}, {"title": "After Katrina, Store Made New Orleans Believe 9th Ward Was 'Coming Back'", "text": "One man used a grocery store to help bring security to a damaged New Orleans neighborhood.New Orleans native Burnell Cotlon created one of the first grocery stores in the city’s Lower 9th Ward since it was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina a decade ago, NationSwell reported.

Snouts are nuzzled with reckless abandon and tongues go flying. We know this because we set one up in New York City's Tompkin's Square Park last Thursday. A bunch of dogs graciously offered their services, tongues and tail wags for a good, bark-worthy cause, and to honor their loved ones on National Dog Day (which happens to be Wednesday, August 26).Tyler, an 11-month-old pit bull terrier, and Loki, a 3-year-old American Staffordshire terrier were two of the first to man dog the booth.

The Midwest Unrest protesters said on Tuesday that Kerry should step in and stop the company from completing the project.“Why in the world would we let them proceed without an environmental review?” said Greta Herrin, a student from Kalamazoo, Michigan, who attended the protest outside Kerry's residence Tuesday. “This is a corporation that has shown a complete disregard for the people and the Earth.”In 2010, another Enbridge pipeline leaked more than 800,000 gallons of tar sands oil into a Kalamazoo River tributary. It was the largest inland oil spill in the nation's history.The Midwest Unrest protesters, many of whom were bused from the Midwest to Washington overnight, marched to Kerry’s Georgetown residence from a small park nearby. Some held up signs quoting Kerry describing climate change as \"a weapon of mass destruction.\" Others expressed confusion over why the Obama administration would take a more cautious approach toward approving a permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which has been under consideration at the State Department for years.“We're saying, 'Secretary Kerry, pay the same attention to this as you do to Keystone,'\" said Kenny Bruno, a longtime activist who also attended Tuesday's rally. \"They're both dirty, they're both not in the national interest, so you've got to reject it.”The protest drew students, recent graduates and veteran environmental activists.\"I'm mad, and I don't like people lying to us.

Photography by Julie Ann Fineman.With beloved Blue Bottle in hand (a nod to the early morning hour) my collaborator, Julie Ann Fineman, and I head toward Two X Sea -- the celebrated sustainable-fish purveyor that resides on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. Co-founders Bill Foss and Kenny Belov are onboard to let us grill them about the business.As we make our way to the end of the pier we pass countless seafood slaughterhouses and food processors and we're both struck with acute pain -- for our oceans. We're so disturbed we ask Bill and Kenny how many of these places turn a blind eye to raping and pillaging our aquaculture.Their answer is disconcerting: Two X Sea is the only fish operation that harvests ethically here. We point toward the many restaurants on the wharf and Bill adds, \"Not one restaurant you're looking at now is a Two X Sea customer. They don't want to pay for sustainable fish.\"Bill and Kenny are outspoken advocates for reexamining how we eat fish, and if you think eating wild fish is okay they're about to disabuse you. \"Our ecology is being dismembered for the sake of having fish on our plates. Fortunately, though, fish doesn't have to be wholly off the menu.\"The pair are also seemingly unlikely sustainable seafood advocates. Bill co-founded Netscape, but he's passionate about food. So when he left the world of technology he aspired to build a Bay-area food community -- something sorely lacking at the time. In fact, he returned from a trip to Italy downright angry about the American food scene. \"Food should make you scream in a good way. It's much more than something you just shove in your mouth.\"Kenny was born \"Innokenty Belov\" in Moscow where his parents were circus performers. Really. They moved to the U.S. when he was five and introduced him to the world of Florida ocean fishing. In 1996, he moved to San Francisco and ditched a career in photography to develop a new environmental concept -- a socially responsible restaurant.Odd bedfellows, yes, but within minutes of our arrival at Two X Sea we're reassured to learn these guys don't simply evangelize about sustainable fish - they walk the talk. For starters they're both partners in FISH, a sustainable restaurant on the dock at the Sausalito marina. In 2004, FISH had a long list of suppliers that kept shrinking because many of the fishers regurgitated the exact same spiel. \"Everyone uses white lies or 'eco-fibs' to make a sale,\" Kenny admonishes. \"Somewhere along the line, someone spouts one thinking it won't hurt anything, but in the case of seafood that eco-fib is tantamount to plundering our oceans.\"The truth is hard to swallow: our planet is running out of fish simply because we've been taking them out of water faster than nature can put them back. \"At the pace we're going, according to one frightening estimate, the oceans could be virtually emptied of fish by 2050,\" says Jillian Fry, project director of the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.Frustrated with the product they were getting at FISH, in 2008 Bill and Kenny created the McFarland Springs Trout brand -- the world's first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. It's such an incredible operation we'll soon publish a part deux of this article, but for now we'll tell you this: they're farming trout using a fully vegetarian diet and the results are stunning.Perhaps it's the company we keep, but our experience says people are clamoring for sustainable seafood - so we assume there's a standard for sustainably caught fish. Bill counters: \"There is a booming demand but there's no federal regulation on sustainability or organic fish, per se. Sure, everyone uses the word 'sustainable' in their marketing - it's a chance to make a sale. Consumers need to be educated.\"Where do you start? \"First, you need to think about how the fish you're eating was caught or raised,\" Bill expounds. \"If something is on a menu 365 days a year that's a huge red flag. How is that even possible? There isn't a species alive that can produce year-round in volume.\"Kenny, the excitable, high-energy seafood Sherpa simply can't resist weighing in. \"Unless it's caught fresh and then frozen, it's rare for something to be available all year. Squid freezes well, so you'll see it on menus a lot and that's okay. Yellow-fin tuna is a whole other story...\"The pair says they're \"over-ethical\" about their fish. \"Everything is right there. We're upfront. There is no fibbing, and there are no lies.\" With McFarland Springs Trout, they're trying to create better food solutions and FISH - which began based on the belief that if we educate the consumer we can influence their decisions - is finally bringing it to the public,\" Bill rallies.Ironically, one of the best tools the men say they have as restaurateurs, chefs, and seafood wholesalers is to say NO! \"When a customer asks for fish we don't have (because it's not ethically harvested) it's our job to say 'let me explain why and tell you what we have that's comparable,\" Kenny clarifies. \"Customers might get frustrated and even leave, but when they're driving home I know they're thinking about our catch method.\"Kenny tells a story of a customer who came in for scallops. When he quoted the price -- $25 for a pound for 16 pieces -- she slammed her keys down on the counter and said, \"Are they made of GOLD?\" Kenny gibes: \"I told her they're diver scallops, not day-boat scallops. She appreciated the opportunity to learn, then hosted an amazing dinner party with scallops she bought from us.\"Two X Sea is clearly about environment before margin, but is that even doable? Bill is quick to respond. \"Margins that have to expand, that's a flawed business model. We're making a small margin and saying 'that's good, that's enough' -- and we're proud of that. People might go somewhere else, but that's our mindset.\"It's a mindset that garnered FISH the first restaurant endorsement from Monterey Bay Aquarium, a program that promises customers everything on its menu can be eaten with a clear conscience. There's even a Seafood Watch app for that.\"Every fish from FISH or Two X Sea comes with a warranty, if you will,\" Kenny says. \"Our business model is growing at a fantastic rate for the Bay area. We're always looking for more boats and more captains. We have boats in San Diego, Oregon, and Alaska and we're getting ready to open a second trout farm, but everything has to meet our standards - fair price and no bycatch.\"\"We're the eyes and ears and advocates for chefs. They trust us,\" Bill adds. \"With every generation, every decade, we see a significant change in their mindset. I hope this younger generation of chefs and consumers creates a change.\"What about those neighboring businesses? Kenny jumps back into the fray: \"The choices they make don't bug me quite like they used to. We were told it couldn't be done, but we're doing it - -and now we're a household name in the Bay area. When I get to the end of the pier every morning I know we're growing faster than any other because we stuck to a set of morals and ethics.\"I can't resist asking about my personal favorite, Ahi tuna. Kenny looks at me with a dash of disdain and a heaping helping of despair: \"Most Ahi is caught on pelagic longlines - 40+ miles of floating line with baited hooks dangling every three feet. The lines catch tuna and everything else in the habitat, including tens of thousands of whales, dolphins, sharks, porpoises, seabirds, and sea turtles.\"Alas, no more Ahi tuna unless it comes from Two X Sea. This formidable duo has us craving a cohesive, collective consciousness about fish because as Bill puts it: \"We've been treating the ocean and the seemingly limitless supply of free fish as a given. If we don't have a backup solution, there's going to be a whole lot of hungry people.\""}, {"title": "Take A Rare Look At 'World's Biggest Heart'", "text": "The blue whale has a lot of heart.Thought to be the biggest animal to ever inhabit the Earth, the creature would presumably have an impressive ticker, too.But this has been a guessing game because preserved blue whale hearts are rare, according to a new series called \"Big Blue Live,\" airing on PBS in the U.S. and BBC in the U.K.In a teaser posted to YouTube, a technician from The Royal Ontario Museum shows off what is believed to be one of the few blue whale hearts ever preserved.

I don't getting trashed. I mean minding your trash. These days getting wasted means becoming more grounded and conscious about the food we eat and utilizing every part of it rather than throwing it out.The United States is an agricultural wonder abundant in food. Stores stock hundreds of products both farm-raised and man-made. Restaurants and food shops are on every block in cities and towns. Yet, we waste more food than we ingest, and more than 46 million Americans are living with food insecurity (lack of food).World Food Day, a day of action against hunger, is Oct. 15, 2015. A few facts from World Food USA's website:Every year, consumers in industrialized countries waste almost as much food as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (222 million vs. 230 million tons).We should be aware of food waste every day and give another thought to the unused or uneaten food we toss out. Most everything is reusable in some form. Many well known chefs have become anti waste food waste activists, including Dan Barber  and Tom Colicchio.Issues of food waste have dogged me most of my life. My mother loved to shop for food but was usually too busy to cook all of it. A lot of spoiled food went into the garbage and the smells and sight of it lingered with me. As a single adult I never stocked my refrigerator. I just shopped for what I needed when I wanted it, or I dined out and took home the leftovers. These days I am even more sensitive to trimming our food waste and am learning to rethink the bits and pieces of food left from our home cooking adventures.There are dozens of ways to trim your waste. Here are six:Do Over Left Overs: I've always liked to nosh on cold leftovers in the morning (e.g., pasta, salads, chicken). But what about greens that look less lively? These can be chopped and scrambled into eggs, stir fried with rice, mixed in with pasta or baked in a quiche. Leftover meats, chicken and fish can be chopped and mixed into a mixed greens or grains salad or tossed on a home-made pizza. We keep store-bought pizza dough in the refrigerator to make a leftovers pizza for lunch.Salad To Soup: Wilted greens and salads perk up when blended with plain yogurt or milk for a chilled soup. If you don't like drinking dairy try using nut milk, fresh fruit juice, coconut water, vegetable broth or green or herbal tea for your liquid. A salad to soup works best when the residual dressing is a vinaigrette. I like the added tang in the mixture.Just Juice It: If vegetables and fruits are just past their peak, toss them in a juicer. The flavors are still rich, and nothing goes to waste. We've made fiber rich crackers and croutons from the residual pulp from kale and spinach juice.Simmer Down: Chicken stock has long been popular for using left over bones and carcass bits. For vegetable stock, cut up the bits, ends, stalks and skins and simmer with herbs of your choice in a pot of water just covering the vegetables for about an hour. We also reuse the vegetable broth from pans of sautéed greens like kale, spinach, mustard greens and Swiss chard.Mash It: Everything tastes better folded into mashed into potatoes. We boil new potatoes and mash with Greek yogurt to taste and TBS olive oil (or butter).Ugly Fruit = Beautiful Dishes. Imperfect or over ripe fruits and vegetables from the close out bins at supermarkets and farm stands can serve their purpose in smoothies and purées, cakes and pies, juices and vinaigrette. There is even a movement now called #uglyfruit to encourage people to not be wasteful and offer tips.Trimming your waste makes sense economizing at home and being more sensitive to the global issues of food waste, food insecurity and the environment. So don't trash your dinner. Reheat! Reuse! Repurpose!Here are some other resources I found to learn more about food waste, how to make smarter changes at home and how to be an advocate on the subject.www.endfoodwastenow.orgwww.thinkeatsave.orgwww.change.org/p/whattheforkDo you have tips to trim your waste?"}, {"title": "'Cat Hospital' Is The Best Cat Soap Opera You Will See All Day", "text": "Sometimes a series comes along that changes the landscape of entertainment forever.

The wee thing weighed just 138 grams at birth, or about a third of a pound. (Mei, for her part, weighs about 238 pounds.)Meanwhile, the smaller cub, who weighed 86 grams when he or she was born -- that's 0.18 pounds -- is being cared for \"more intensely\" by zoo staff, according to the news release.That care includes bottle and tube feeding, subcutaneous fluids and prophylactic antibiotics to stave any infections.Why are panda babies so small, you are no doubt wondering?It's thought to be an evolutionary strategy: Researchers believe that it is more efficient for pandas to convert their primary food source, bamboo, into milk than it is to grow more animal tissue.But being born so small presents almost countless risks for the blind, hairless and extremely fragile -- not to mention incredibly rare, genetically valuable and awfully adorable -- animals.The zoo says this is still, indeed, a \"high-risk period\" for the twins.

An atheist and a proselyte can both agree that in the parks we see something so much bigger and grander than ourselves, something that freely gives us the cosmic gifts of light and heat, and stimulates trees to grow up. We see that the processes upon which all life depend go on independent of us, that we are so fragile and yet so beloved.In my campaign to return us to love, I think the only place that can do it -- indeed the place that was created to do it -- is our indescribable, world class National Park System. If the idea sounds preposterous, talk to the American writer Wallace Stegner who called them the \"best idea our country ever had,\" or Ken Burns who used that title for his groundbreaking series. (Today in the New York Times my friend Michael Allen revisits the Reconstruction Era through the lens of national parks.)The agonizing state that our country is in shows that the majority of leaders and citizens neither feel love for ourselves nor for the world. You cannot love anyone until you first love yourself, and the place to discover a healthy helping of self-love is in our national parks.This week we take the 40 Congresspersons from our last virtual trip to tour the wilds of Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, through the portal of my memory. The leaders are from both political parties, a cross section of members of natural resource and other committees, and members of ethnic caucuses.

You can follow along with HuffPost Pit Bull Week here, or on social media where we'll be using the hashtag #PitBullWeek.Dogfighting, the “sport” where dogs are bred and trained to fight each other to the death, is a felony in all 50 states -- but it's still a crime that appears to be both relatively common and infrequently prosecuted.Rebecca Corry, an actress, comic and writer, is trying to change that -- in the Los Angeles area, at least.Through her nonprofit Stand Up for Pits Foundation, which was also responsible for last year’s Million Pibble March on Washington, Corry has launched a new tip line -- 877-777-2585 -- allowing individuals in Los Angeles County to confidentially report incidents of dogfighting that they witness or suspect.Their incentive? A reward of up to $5,000 provided by the Humane Society of the United States in the event of an arrest or conviction as the result of a tip provided through the line, which launched on July 1.“It sickens me to my core that animals would be forced, and that’s the word, forced, to fight to the death for money, entertainment or human pleasure in any way,” Corry told The Huffington Post. “It’s absolutely disgusting and it’s everywhere, being done by all kinds of people, all over the place. It’s time to end it, period.”Though other existing tip lines -- like CrimeStoppers and the HSUS’s national dogfighting tip line -- already allow citizens to alert law enforcement to suspected animal abuse including dogfighting (and if a dogfight in progress is witnessed, a 911 call should be made), the Stand Up for Pits line takes a slightly different approach.Covering only the immediate Los Angeles County area, the tip line allows private investigators working with the organization to look into tips they receive in an effort to determine if a tip is legitimate and to provide more thorough information to law enforcement.Receiving a more comprehensive tip can make a big difference for time-crunched law enforcement, Christine Murray, a retired police officer who works as one of the line’s two investigators, explained to HuffPost.“Our hope is to kind of vet the tips and have an investigator look at what they’ve got to determine if the tips are workable,” Murray said. “So we can serve up to law enforcement a very robust tip rather than a vague one, to show them that this is one you want to work because it has potential and it’s not just a dog barking call.”The tip line, which is funded through charity comedy events and the sales of apparel on the organization's website, is also operated not as an answering service but, instead, with live operators answering calls that come in around the clock.These are key differences that make Deborah Knaan, head of the animal cruelty division at Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, confident that Corry’s line could succeed where other efforts have fallen short. Knaan was consulted by Corry as she went about building the line, a process that took about a year.“It’s very localized which means it’s going to get a lot of attention by the people working the tips and the people working the tips will be very familiar with LA County,” Knaan told HuffPost.Because dogfighting operations operate in an underground economy, it is practically impossible to know exactly how pervasive the problem is, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates that tens of thousands of people are involved with the practice in the U.S. and many officials believe that number may be climbing.According to Chris Schindler, HSUS animal rescue team manager of animal fighting response, the organization's tip line is receiving a steadily climbing number of tips each year and is on pace to surpass 5,000 tips for the first time this year.While dogfighting cases come up in a diverse set of settings -- urban, rural and everything in between -- the Los Angeles area appears to be home to more than its fair share of it.Over the past 10 years, felony dogfighting charges have been filed against 16 defendants in the county, according to data from the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.In a high-profile case late last year, Pauline Winbush, an assistant superintendent at Palmdale Unified School District, was charged along with her boyfriend with four felony counts of dogfighting, 17 felony counts of animal cruelty and one felony count of child abuse. Winbush pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in the case wherein investigators found almost 20 injured or malnourished pit bulls and a dead puppy and other animals at the couple’s home in Lancaster.At a statewide level, California is home to among the highest number of dogfighting cases in recent years in the nation.The degree to which the tip line is successful in combatting all of that depends, of course, on how many people become aware of it.“A lot of times people know it is happening in their community but are afraid to report,\" Knaan said. \"And until somebody reports, nothing can be done.\"Since the line began, Corry said they've already received viable tips and she hopes that trend will continue. Corry plans to promote the number through billboard ads and the distribution of flyers in communities and animal shelters in the months ahead. In addition, all of the county’s 100 Animal Care and Control trucks are, as of earlier this month, sporting the tip line number.It's with good reason that the tip line is a priority for the county.Marcia Mayeda, the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control director, explained that they are supporting the line not only because of the viciousness of the fighting and the effect it has on the dogs, but also on the documented connections between dogfighting and other forms of animal abuse and crimes directed at humans such as domestic abuse, child abuse and sexual violence. Illegal drugs and gambling are also commonly connected with dogfighting cases.“Dogfighting is just part of a larger situation in which animals and people are harmed,” Mayeda said.While a range of dog breeds are used for fighting, pit bulls and pit bull-type dogs are most at risk of becoming victims of the practice in the U.S., according to the ASPCA.Even when dogs are rescued from a fighting operation, they often require significant rehabilitation before they are able to be safely housed and must be evaluated before an adoption is even considered.But even with all the obstacles, it is all worth it to Corry, who hopes to see others create similarly localized tip lines on the issue in the future.“We believe that if every county and state had a tip line running, people would know what to do and communities would empower themselves to get animal abusers arrested and put away, which is where they belong,” Corry added. “You’ve got some seriously broken people with some serious issues and these dogs are the voiceless victims of it. They’re helpless.”Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Waikiki Beach Reopens Following Sewage Spill", "text": "UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- The beaches at Waikiki and Ala Moana were reopened Wednesday morning following an announcement by Honolulu city officials that the water was not contaminated by Monday's sewage spill.The ocean off those beaches was determined safe to enter after tests were conducted on water samples, according to Hawaii News Now. The spill was originally thought to be 500,000 gallons of sewage, but that estimate has been reduced to 128,000 gallons, according to KITV.Original story continues below:Honolulu's famed Waikiki Beach is closed after an estimated 500,000 gallons of untreated wastewater came pouring out of several manholes on Monday.After a weekend of thunderstorms and extreme humidity, debris reportedly clogged storm drains while the heavy rains had overwhelmed the city's sewage system.Authorities are now urging the public to stay away from most of Waikiki, Hawaii's most popular tourist attraction -- and that means not entering the ocean along the beachfront.It could be a couple of days before it's safe enough for people to go back in the water, The Associated Press reports.The city has posted signs to warn beachgoers of the potentially dangerous contamination while city crews work to stop the spill, KHON2 reports. Officials are also advising people to avoid contact with standing water near the site of the spill.\"We don't know right now what is in the water. You could get a serious infection, get extremely sick or even worse,\" Shayne Enright, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Emergency Services, told AP.But some people aren't taking the threat seriously.\"Even if they don't let me, I'm still going in. … That's a lot of water there. I don't think a little particle is gonna hurt me,\" California visitor Adam Rago told Hawaii News Now.The heavy rains, which stemmed from Tropical Depression Kilo, also caused flooding in many areas of the state, leading to flash flood warnings and school closures.State officials said some people in Waikiki had opened manhole covers to help alleviate flooding, which actually let extra water drain into and overwhelm the sewage system.But as disastrous as it sounds, this spill can't hold a candle to Honolulu's 2006 sewage spill, during which almost 50 million gallons of raw sewage poured into Waikiki's infamous Ala Wai Canal.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Give Us the Whole Truth About Fracking", "text": "Co-authored by Stephen J. McConnellThe facts are slippery when it comes to the great fracking debate in America, where truth, lies, and spin often collide and end up leaving us confused and dizzy.And sometimes we sadly get treated to the perfect mix of manipulation of fact and fiction, courtesy of the powers that be, that leaves us even more dazed and confused than we were before we got that dose of unreality. That's what we're often subjected to in the fracking debate, and it even makes us engage in what George Orwell called \"doublethink\" -- the perverse ability to hold two contradictory beliefs as correct in our minds without noticing the contradiction.But the latest example of the fracking doublethink has major implications for our health and our nation: the EPA's recently released landmark assessment on the \"Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources.\" The assessment concludes that fracking has contaminated many drinking water sources while also concluding that no evidence was found to declare that fracking poses \"widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States.\"That's just ludicrous.We hoped the EPA report would finally give us an unequivocal statement about fracking in America and ideally a roadmap to help us make sure this industry poses no threat to our drinking water, our health, and our communities.Instead, the EPA gave us an assessment on the current state of fracking in America -- based as they say on the \"state-of-the-science\" -- that is woefully inadequate: It is incomplete, premature, rushed and filled with so many caveats that it is hard to take it seriously with all due respect to an agency that is charged with protecting our health and our environment while contending with politicians who want to eradicate it.To their credit, the EPA is quite clear about the assessment's constraints, or what it deems \"limiting factors,\" which is a nice way of saying the credibility of the study suffers as well as their findings (including the conclusion that no evidence was found to declare fracking poses \"widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources.\")These \"limiting factors\" include: insufficient data regarding drinking water quality in places before they were fracked and after they were fracked; the scarce number of long-term, comprehensive studies about fracking; and the \"inaccessibility of some information on hydraulic fracturing activities and potential impacts.\" Regarding the latter of that series of limitations, we can thank the Halliburton loophole for that, which helps keep many of the chemical-laced fracking recipes a secret and prevents federal oversight of the industry.Littered throughout the nearly 1,000-page report are other direct acknowledgments by EPA that a \"lack of data\" hampered its ability to assess the true impacts of fracking. These statements from the assessment are revealing:This assessment used available data and literature to examine the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas on drinking water resources nationally. As part of this effort, we identified data limitations and uncertainties associated with current information on hydraulic fracturing and its potential to affect drinking water resources. In particular, data limitations preclude a determination of the frequency of impacts with any certainty.And that's a tremendous flaw.How can we declare \"we did not find evidence\" to support the statement that fracking does not appear to pose a widespread, systematic threat when there is limited data (a lack of scientific studies) on hand to make that determination? Not to mention that the \"facts\" reviewed by EPA were derived from state and industry studies that are subject to political and economic bias and undermined by data not so easily attainable (i.e. proprietary fracking formulas).With all of these data gaps and potential avenues for bias, of course the EPA found it difficult to determine with certainty as to whether fracking posed a widespread threat. Yet amid these issues, the assessment still noted instances of drinking water contamination including \"spills of hydraulic fracturing fluid\" that \"reached drinking water resources,\" as well as \"below ground movement of fluids, including gas, most likely via the production well\" that \"have contaminated drinking water resources,\" not to mention fracking fluids that were \"directly injected into drinking water resources.\"And that's the issue: a problem exists, a big problem. We shouldn't have to rely on doublethink to get us by when it comes to fracking. We shouldn't be OK with it being somewhat dangerous (reported contaminations) and somewhat safe (apparently not widespread).Also looking at how haphazard this fracking assessment appears to be, there's little question in my mind that it was rushed out the door by EPA (with pressure from industry) because industry knew the data, or lack of it, worked in their favor. Undoubtedly, it was also expedited due to the pressure from other interests, including environmentalists, because those opposed to fracking needed evidence delivered as quickly as possible to persuade Congress to pass tougher regulations on fracking.But something that is incomplete, rushed and mired with a thousand caveats and excuses does not serve us well. We're not going to solve this issue -- or be able to differentiate between fact and fiction -- unless we collect hard facts backed by evidence to work from and act on.But we can still fix it, so we know the whole truth and hopefully persuade Congress to enact laws that ensure the best regulations and regulators are in place to watchdog the industry. We can persuade the EPA to do the right thing and take the bold steps it needs to take: namely, conduct a more thorough and more honest assessment that also avoids citing questionable studies as evidence.So here's what we must do next: The agency is accepting public comments on the assessment until August 28. We need to make sure the science -- and thus the evidence -- is right to ensure the great fracking debate is suffused with truth -- not spin, lies, distortion, half-formed truths, or worse, doublethink.If we are to persuade Congress to regulate fracking nationally -- which, as a precautionary measure and even in the absence of comprehensive scientific evidence seems like a good thing to do -- we might stand a chance of protecting human health and the environment. And I say this knowing that we have already racked up quite a bit of evidence about fracking.This assessment is a major step in the right direction. But the assessment must be bolder and more truthful. It must rely more so on the EPA's own analysis of fracking to draw its conclusions rather than the findings of others including the industry. Most importantly, it must be complete -- free of caveats and excuses about limited data and other so-called constraints.That's all we ask: the truth and not the state-of-the-science or any other euphemisms we've come up with to politely explain that what we are still far from the truth."}, {"title": "This Group Wants To Build A Giant Barrier To Pull Trash From The Pacific", "text": "In 2020, the Pacific Ocean might actually start to get a bit cleaner.That's the hope of The Ocean Cleanup, an organization that on Sunday completed a reconnaissance mission geared toward measuring the amount of plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Researchers used GPS and a smartphone app to detect pollution during the monthlong mission.\"I've never seen an oceanic area as polluted as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,\" Julia Reisser, the group's lead oceanographer, said during a press conference in San Francisco.Mounting garbage has been a tremendous problem for the world's oceans. Currently, coastal countries add 8 million tons of plastic to our oceans every year, and the rate is accelerating -- in part because many more people are now able to actually afford plastic products.The Ocean Cleanup's so-called Mega Expedition, which was funded in part by tech entrepreneur Marc Benioff, found that some of the plastic in the Pacific had been there since the 1950s. Fish can become contaminated when they eat plastic, so you can imagine why getting rid of the garbage is of urgent ecological concern.To that end, the Ocean Cleanup group hopes to deploy a 60-mile-long barrier in the middle of the Pacific to trap the garbage and make it easier to dispose of responsibly. They'll publish the findings of their expedition next year and get to work on a 1-mile prototype first, according to the Associated Press.Of course, cleaning the ocean is only part of the battle. Sustainable solutions are required to actually prevent the problem from getting worse.Still, it's a start. Boyan Slat, founder of The Ocean Cleanup, made that clear during the press conference.\"With a single system, in 10 years time, approximately half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can be cleaned up,\" Slat said."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - August 25, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: It's official: July 2015 was the hottest month ever recorded on Planet Earth; Record wildfire season in the U.S. gets even worse; Scientists stumped by mysterious whale deaths in Washington State; Oil prices hit hard by China stock crash; PLUS: Obama boosts clean energy, calls out the fossil fuel industry's anti-free market ideology...

Without Eggs", "text": "[Imagine movie-trailer, deep baritone:] \"In a world where 48 million chickens have been destroyed...\"It sounds like the teaser for a science-fiction or horror movie, but it also happens to be the opening line of a recent all-staff newsletter I sent out about the impact of avian influenza (commonly known as 'bird flu').Luckily, as summer blockbusters have reminded us week in and week out, every massive box office success worth its salt comes with a hero who saves the day. In this 'movie,' however -- let's call it A World Without Eggs -- we have not just one, but many, heroes who have helped save the day.As the vice president of strategy for a $1 billion food service company, it's my job to anticipate any developing scenarios that might affect our business. So, when I became aware of the predictions that unprecedented egg shortages and price increases would unfold in short order (which they did), I simply responded, \"We'll have to tell the chefs to think of alternatives to eggs,\" kind of like Captain Picard says \"Make it so.\" (Did I just liken myself to Patrick Stewart? Yes. Yes, I did.)Of course, I knew that was easier said than done.But what happened next surprised me. Knowing that eggs are a crucial ingredient in baking, I turned to my colleague Jim Dodge, the Obi-Wan Kenobi of ovens (and an old friend of  the ultimate culinary superhero, Julia Child). This Jedi Master quickly gave me a list of scrumptious-sounding desserts that required absolutely zero eggs, from almond Florentines to chocolate truffles and fruit-filled puff-pastry tarts. YUM.So far, our previously uncharted course through a galaxy without eggs saw no sign of threats from the dessert Death Star. But what in the universe would we do about breakfast? We serve more than a million breakfasts a week, and I feared widespread uprisings, from Tatooine to Naboo if we had to cut eggs from our morning menus.So, like Daniel LaRusso seeking out Asian traditions to fight the bad guys in The Karate Kid, our chefs began looking for ways to wax off eggs from their shopping lists. How? By menuing traditional ethnic cuisines that don't include eggs. I turned to my colleagues (Mr. & Mrs. Miyagis, all of them), for guidance. The award-winning chef and cookbook author Raghavan Iyer, who partners with us for culinary trainings, pointed out that in India people start their days with dishes such as savory cream of wheat with vegetables, steamed rice-lentil cakes and crepes, and chickpea flour crepes with chilis and onion, or besan cheela. Other chefs are serving jook, a savory Chinese rice porridge. Michael Cleary, our executive chef at St. John's College, also uses the gluten-free chickpea flour in the Mediterranean omelet-like dishes socca and farinata.Learning a lesson from George Clooney's attempt to play Batman (have I taken the movie analogy too far?), my heroes do warn about the peril in replacing a known star of the show. The keys to winning over your audience? Go heavy into regional authenticity and offering exciting sides, whether cilantro-coconut chutney or tzatziki.Many chefs pointed out that by replacing scrambled eggs and omelets -- with savory stratas, casseroles, quiche, and tarts -- we could reduce our egg usage by 60 to 70 percent, because eggs are only 30 to 40 percent of the liquid ingredients in the custard base. Plus, these dishes are also a great way to utilize leftover vegetables and meat, and reduce food cost. Just as everyone watches box office returns (sorry, can't resist one more movie reference), our chefs do track their financial performance.Please don't mistake my levity for callousness: Avian flu is a terrible thing -- the loss of so many birds' lives is a tragedy. But, as the theme song from long-ago summer blockbuster The Jewel of the Nile reminds us, \"When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\" I think our efforts to make our way in A World Without Eggs would make Billy Ocean proud."}, {"title": "EPA's Common-Sense Climate Measure: Fix Methane Leaks", "text": "Written by Tim BalloEven for dedicated do-it-yourselfers, finding and fixing leaks can be a hassle. So when a few drops of water appear under the sink or a dark stain forms on the ceiling during a heavy rain, many of us might look for any excuse to procrastinate in tackling the problem.The oil and gas industry can relate.For years, the industry claimed that the equipment needed to identify natural gas leaks could be time-consuming to use, and that it supposedly had more profitable things to do. Now, however, new camera technologies enable operators to easily see leaks of invisible natural gas. This ability to quickly identify the source of a leak means that finding and fixing them is more cost-effective and efficient than ever.Yet the oil and gas industry still leaks [not to mention deliberately vents and flares] millions of tons of natural gas into the air as it drills and transports oil and gas. This is murder on our climate because natural gas is almost pure methane—a gas that is up to 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping climate-changing heat.Failing to find and fix leaks is a big part of the reason why the oil and gas sector is the second largest industrial source of climate pollution in the US, after electric power plants.Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the first national standards to limit methane pollution from this industry. The proposal offers sensible, cost-effective solutions to limit methane from new facilities, like requiring regular inspections to look for and fix leaks.It is also an important down payment towards meeting President Obama's goal of reducing methane pollution from oil and gas operations 40 to 45 percent by 2025. Reducing this pollution is critical because EPA projects that the current oil and gas boom will increase methane emissions by more than 25 percent over the same time-span if nothing is done to prevent it.The proposal is far from perfect. It covers only new and modified facilities, not the vast network of equipment already in use. But it legally lays the groundwork for a future program to address existing equipment. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA's standards for new facilities determine the extent of the agency's authority to clean up existing equipment [in this case, the equipment responsible for most of the pollution like pumps, valves, tanks and compressors].Getting broad coverage on this proposed standard means the EPA will eventually be able to put in place strong standards for this existing equipment—the next action on climate that should be at the top of the agency's \"to-do\" list.In the meantime, the agency should address an obvious shortcoming in the proposal that might reward companies for not finding leaks. Currently, companies that claim to find very few leaks would be allowed to start checking for leaks less often. This feature of the proposal is ripe for abuse. Given that inspections have become easy and affordable, there is every reason to conduct them regularly.Certainly, limits on methane pollution cannot address all of the harms that flow from gas drilling, fracking and burning. Our future depends on the ability to transition quickly from fossil fuels to actual clean energy. In the face of rising methane pollution, cutting methane emissions is becoming even more essential to combat climate change and create healthier communities.This proposal is a critical step in the right direction, especially considering the international climate negotiations are just a few months away. Getting our own house in order by creating a common-sense solution to fix preventable methane leaks should make it easier to build a convincing case for other countries to take meaningful action on climate.Nothing short of strong standards for existing sources of methane pollution will achieve President Obama's crucial goal of cutting methane emissions nearly in half over the next decade. The President and EPA can help achieve this goal by committing to a prompt timeline for cleaning up existing oil and gas operations as well as future operations.Earthjustice will continue to use the power of law and the strength of partnerships to ensure that we meet and exceed that key benchmark."}, {"title": "Doubling Down on Clean Energy", "text": "President Obama doubled down today on climate and clean energy, saying \"No challenge poses a greater threat to our future than climate change.\" Speaking at the eighth Clean Energy Summit, in his first public appearance since vacation, Obama launched an 11 day climate barnstorming campaign. His blunt speech directly challenged climate sceptics as ignoring the new logic of the market, saying that now clean energy was cheaper, fossil interests still refused to embrace change. Obama asserted \"we believe we can do good while doing well at the same time.\" He laid out a series of policy initiatives - the most important a long overdue message to federal banking regulators to get out of the way on programs that help homeowners bring down their energy bills by making their buildings less leaky.The 11 days -- today in Las Vegas, next Thursday in New Orleans, the following week to the Arctic -- were a prelude, the President promised, to a 100 day long marathon leading up to the Paris Climate COP. The overall campaign will continue through the National League of Cities Convention in Nashville in November, culminating at the UN Summit. In Obama's mind, it is a campaign \"between those who fear the future and those who are eager to see the future.\"The opening salvo was buttressed by the two key dynamics that the President expects to drive an ambitious if incomplete climate deal over the Paris finish line: city leadership and clean energy economic clout.While the formal negotiations between UN member states drag and lag at a lowest common denominator pace, the real front line warriors, cities, are crowding into an international diplomatic space long closed to them. As former NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg signaled in his Foreign Affairs manifesto this month, the world's first Metropolitan Generation has been handled the climate challenge, and it is going to meet with an urban strategy: diverse, bottom up and profitable.Yesterday the White House challenged America's cities to turbocharge the Compact of Mayors. \"The Compact is an initiative supported by Mike Bloomberg, the UN and global city networks - C40, ICLEI, UCLG - coming together to create a measurable accountable reporting platform through which cities say to their nation-states, in effect, \"You Mr. Prime Minister may be forced to hesitate and equivocate, but we will lead. And you can measure our results - so the world will know what can be done.\" Fifteen new American cities joined the Compact today, almost doubling the membership - Atlanta, Austin, Bridgeport, Camuy (PR), Chicago, Chula Vista, Grand Rapids, King County, New York, Oakland, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, West Hollywood, West Palm Beach. And a twelve city Leadership Circle chaired by Salt Lake City made it clear that urban voices would be in Paris in force.It is clear that the Administration understands that cities and the Mayors who lead them need to have its back in the two key arenas: internationally where other nations wonder if Congress will let Obama deliver, and domestically, where Big Carbon's hopes rest on a blocking minority of Governors and Attorneys General thwarting the national consensus that carbon pollution needs cleaning up. By acting independently and visibly, cities show the world that the US is cleaning up its act.Nevada was the perfect showcase for the second of the forces the President and his climate team are counting on to deliver success in Paris - the dynamism of clean energy. As Senator Reid reminded the audience, eight years ago - in the first of these summits - former President Clinton challenged Nevada to produce more clean energy than it uses. Today, the Silver State on a per capita basis is already capturing more electrons from the wind, sun and geothermal  than any other state, and has announced the retirement of all its coal fired power. Now it is about to experience the first true clean energy boom, in the form of  6,500 manufacturing jobs and 9000 construction jobs being added in Washoe and Storey Counties (Reno and Sparks)  by Tesla Motors EV batteries Gigafactory. (This one project will employ 1/5 of the number still working to mine coal in the US.)The media had largely missed this until Obama arrived Monday -Google \"Nevada clean energy leadership.\" But Hilary Clinton's campaign had not - she signalled Nevada as her Western fire-wall state. Democrats took a huge bath in 2014 because the state's construction-juiced economy had not recovered from the Recession. But Tesla plus clean power equals recovery, and makes Nevada a dismal prospect for a Republican Presidential candidate determined to trash clean power. (Neither Nevada's Republican Governor nor its Republican Senator, Dean Heller, have ever joined the \"clean power means socialism\" caucus - but virtually every Republican Presidential candidate has.)Reid, who is retiring, paid tribute to the progress America's electricity sector has made - but reminded us of how many miles we have yet to go, and how mired in the past much of the utility industry is. In inimitable Harry Reid fashion, he treated us to a long analogy between the clean energy revolution and the arrival of sabermetrics in baseball. Reid recounted that before Manager Billy Bean and the Oakland A's of 2002, baseball teams just bought the highest batting averages, and assumed that would yield the most wins. That, Reid told us, is yesterday's utility model: built enough big coal and nuclear power plants, and you'll always have a (wasteful) surplus to meet your customers' needs. But, Reid said, customers wanted something less wasteful, something cheaper - better, not just bigger -- and clean energy is providing it.So Obama came to Reno today to energize his two secret climate progress weapons - cities and profits. And both of them seem ready to accompany him, not only for the next 100 days on the road to Paris, but after than on the road through Paris.(PS: When Harry Reid's political career began, Nevada economy's was still rooted in the mining past of his own home town, Searchlight. Las Vegas thrived - well, because the rest of the country valued a safety valve from legacy Puritanism to gamble. When Reid retires in January 2017 his state will stand out as one of the nation's most successful innovators. Rarely has a Senator done so much for his state and the nation together.)"}, {"title": "How Bernie Sanders Can Use Environmental Policy to Win Over Red State Voters", "text": "Bernie Sanders has strong environmental credentials. Sitting on both the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and Energy and Natural Resources Committees, he promotes environmental protection and argues for measures to control climate change. He's opposed to both fracking and the Keystone XL Pipeline; he co-sponsored the Climate Protection Act of 2013 and introduced the End Polluter Welfare Act. All these actions have been popular with his Vermont constituents. They, and the thinking on which they're based, can be expected to play well for him among liberals, and not hurt him in blue states generally.But what about red state voters? What about conservatives? Is there anything Sanders can say about environmental protection that might not be anathema to them? Anything to counter the inevitable Republican characterization of him as an elitist, ready to elevate the interests of fuzzy owls over those of human beings?Yes, and what he can do is precisely in accord with his positions on jobs, the economy, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the nation's general tilt toward oligarchy.Right in line with his consistent support for the ordinary voter over entrenched economic interests, Sanders can and should attack the way legally-mandated environmental impact assessments of government plans have become corrupted - rigged just like the U.S. economy, to benefit the rich and powerful at the expense of ordinary Americans and their valued environments. This attack, properly planned and executed, could resonate with those who believe (with reason) that the government is their enemy.The environmental impacts of government actions - including its provision of assistance and permits to private industry - are ostensibly reviewed in advance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA is a perennial Republican whipping boy, excoriated for being an impediment to economic development, a jobs-killer, a deplorable government intrusion into the lives of citizens and the operation of markets. It enjoys uncritical, knee-jerk support from Democrats, few of whom give it much thought. Sanders could quite honestly and justifiably acknowledge - charge, in fact - that NEPA has some serious problems, many of them involving the failure to consider impacts on what's nearest and dearest to people where they live - their social, cultural, economic, and public health environments - and propose to fix them.Too wonky? Maybe, but is it really wonkier than interest rates and providing subsidies to polluting industries? The Sanders campaign might be surprised at how many voters feel they've been injured by NEPA practice, or let down by it.There are three big problems with NEPA practice, and they're pretty simple and straightforward. They do hit people where they live, and more and more voters have taken such hits. Fixing them just might be appealing to some conservative voters and not alienate thoughtful liberals. Here they are:1. Corruption. Although NEPA outlines a list of environmental policies (most honored in the breach), its rubber meets the road in its requirement that federal agencies assess the potential environmental impacts of their decisions before making them, and factor that assessment - known as environmental impact assessment or EIA - into decision making. Today, EIA under NEPA is done by profit-making private companies, many of them owned by larger architecture, engineering and planning firms - in other words, builders of the very projects whose impacts they're supposed to assess. The impact analyses performed by these companies are almost always paid for by project proponents - mining companies, pipeline companies, energy companies - sometimes directly, sometimes via federal and state agencies. It's a formula for crooked, unreliable analyses - like the one performed for the Interior Department on the Deepwater Horizon project, that gave it a clear bill of health. We know how well that one worked out for residents along the Gulf coast.SOMEBODY has to pay for EIA, and the logical ones to do so are those who want the projects built. But there are ways to insulate the analysts and decision makers from the financiers; Sanders can and should outline a few of these and promise a real effort to explore them and embed those that can work in the regulatory system.2. Imponderable, inhuman analyses.  On the whole, federal agencies like just to get EIA done so they can check it off their \"to-do\" lists and forget it. So they, or more often the grant-and-permit applicants they oversee, contract for studies. A substantial, well-heeled community of EIA consultants has evolved over the almost half-century since NEPA's enactment, and has developed a pretty rote system for conducting and reporting their work. EIA studies are typically (1) long, (2) complex, (3) written in obscure technical-legal language, and (4) focused on those environmental variables that are easy to count (parts per million of gunk in the water, numbers of endangered species threatened) as opposed to those that actually count in the eyes of the affected public.They're also often flatly crooked, designed to downplay a project's likely impacts while extolling its virtues. They're virtually immune to review, because it takes technical specialists and lawyers to review them, which most affected communities can't afford.3. Ignoring the People. Underlying the other problems is what amounts to scorn for the affected and concerned public. In theory, NEPA provides for public participation in federal agency decisions that can affect the environment, but in fact, it doesn't work. There are many ways an agency or applicant can avoid even revealing its plans - by deciding that they're \"categorically excluded\" from NEPA review, or that they have \"no significant impact\" on the environment - in the latter case, usually after contracting for massive studies that ostensibly support the agency's (usually pre-determined) conclusion. If citizens DO get to participate, it is usually only by being allowed to review and comment on NEPA documents. Agencies and \"environmental\" consulting firms are experts at \"responding\" to such comments in ways that obfuscate and dismiss the issues raised. If members of the public don't have the money to hire their own experts, and to take their complaints to court, their concerns have little chance of being attended to.The trouble is that \"public participation\" doesn't mean anything in particular. Notably, it doesn't mean that the agency responsible for a potentially destructive decision has to sit down with those affected, those concerned, and actually talk with them about their issues, seek ways to resolve them. Agencies, regulated industries, and their consulting firms are free to conduct only what's been called \"Three-I\" participation: \"Inform, get Input, and Ignore.\" IF they allow participation at all.All this could be fixed, without necessarily even amending the statute. NEPA's environmental impact review system is guided by regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive Office of the President. Those regulations could be amended to make analyses more objective, honest, and unbiased, to make them more accessible to the public, and perhaps most of all to require real consultation with affected people - actually working with those affected, seeking ways to resolve their problems. Not giving the tree-huggers a veto, but giving everyone -- tree-huggers, drill-baby-drill advocates, and everybody else -- the ability to make sure their concerns are on the table and actually considered. It has been done in special cases; it can work, and it can be cost-effective.There's no requirement, however, now that it BE done, and as a result, a lot of environmental impact assessments are useless -- however much they cost and however much time they take to prepare. Sanders could fix this, and proposing to do so SHOULD be a populist vote-getter. It would be in the same spirit as his intention to clean up Wall Street. It, too, would be an attack on those who are profiting mightily at the expense of the American people - and in this case, at the expense of the American environment as well.Would doing this win over the red states? Not by itself, of course not. But would it swing some red state votes, and some conservative votes elsewhere? I think so.

The 'regulation kills growth' mindset is especially destructive at a time when the focus within public policy should be on combining economic growth with environmental sustainability, as advocated by economists such as Jeffrey Sachs who argues that, \"today's mounting threats cannot be covered up. The Age of Sustainable Development must be built on openness, participation, and science.\" This sentiment is gaining traction as policymakers look to the Paris Conference in December where 196 countries will meet to sign a critical new climate change agreement.As part of an overarching goal to stabilize and reduce greenhouse gases to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a combination of targeted investments and effective regulation need be made to prevent natural disasters, improve health standards and hence increase productivity.Take global health for instance. Critics of increased environmental standards on air pollution argue that such regulations lead to job losses and those criticisms are correct to an extent, such as the wide-scale closure of factories in Hebei province in China. While the restrictions are restrictions to production, surely what is critically important, without the intention of being facetious, is an ability for workers to breathe. Urban pollution is estimated to cost approximately 2% of GDP in developed countries and 5% of GDP in developing countries. Sidelining the critical wellbeing of labor, a factor of production, is negatively consequential when trying to increase economic growth.Added to this, indoor and outdoor air pollution costs European economies as much as $1.6 trillion each year in deaths and diseases according to a new study published by the World Trade Organisation. While on the one hand businesses that don't commit to such standards end up being fined and have to cut back on workers, on the other hand the current stock of workers will be vastly more productive. A Columbia University research paper titled 'Particulate Pollution and the Productivity of Pear Packers' showed how an 'increase in PM2.5 outdoors leads to a statistically and economically significant decrease in packing speeds inside the factory, with effects arising at levels well below current air quality standards.' The opposite effect on productivity occurred where air pollution was very low in concentration.Addressing the issue of air pollution is critical but the effects of pollution in the long run aren't factored into GDP. Hence, one issue that is frequently raised is the flaws in how GDP is measured; the fundamental flaw being that GDP only takes into account the production and consumption of goods and services in the short run, and excludes any possibility of long-run projections. If GDP were higher, that is always assumed as a positive. However, the basis of future GDP growth rests on a host of assumptions including the condition of the environment, quality of health as well as factors such as population growth and demographics.The issue of conserving the environment to boost economic growth extends to resource sustainability. The myth of perpetual growth is destructive and rests on the notion of infinite resource and environmental security; this would seem obvious to most people, let alone economists, with land being a crucial factor of production. The costs of environmental security can be seen today, particularly with California's severe drought. A preliminary analysis by the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences that the estimated total statewide economic cost was $2.7 billion, largely through the loss in crop revenues.Economic performance, environmental security, and global health standards are all interdependent and policymakers cannot compromise or pick and choose which of the three are most important. The cruciality in encompassing all three into public focus is in light with a study by the Lancet and University College London that states climate change \"is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.\" This cruciality extends to shifting away from a public policy vice of short-term thinking towards long-term planning with long-term objectives for investments that create effective returns over time. Dr Jim Yong Kim, current president of the World Bank in 2014 stated, \"Taking action now will not only solve the problem of protecting the planet, but it will be a tremendous boost for economies.\"Investments today can prevent or merely curtail eventual resource scarcities, slowing down the point at which we will reach peak oil and meet critical aggregate water scarcity, crises that would breed conflicts within and across national borders. It is why the Pentagon refers to the impacts of climate change as a \"threat multiplier\" which aggravates poverty, political instability and social tensions.Environmental regulations can lead to job losses and economic inactivity as seen in Hebei but also protect labour and land, both factors of production essential to economic growth. Sachs notes that, \"We have been walking blindly into tragedies and more will come unless we learn to open our minds and our ethical reasoning to the current crisis.\"Perhaps this reasoning will be implemented if policymakers acknowledged the importance of protecting and sustaining standards for the environment, global health as well as economic growth, advocated sustainable development and rejected this false dichotomy."}, {"title": "Celebrate The National Park Service's 100th Birthday With These Beautiful Photos", "text": "On this day in 1916, Congress created the National Park Service as a way to preserve America’s gorgeous public lands and historical sites.

Authorities report that more than 100 tons of sodium cyanide were present at the site, along with toluene diisocyanate, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium carbide. Thousands of Chinese citizens were evacuated from the port area, as rescuers in gas masks and protective gear attempted to manage the environmental crisis. In Tianjin, the next thing to fear was rain -- rain that could cause new chemical reactions and release more deadly gases and toxins into the air and groundwater.The tragedy in China has drawn comparisons to the 1984 Bhopal disaster, and the stunning images of its aftermath have evoked memories of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. It has also underscored the silent catastrophe of China's failed environmental policy, where according to one new study from Berkeley Earth, an estimated 4,400 people die every day from air pollution-related causes.But this is by no means only China's problem. What really happened in Tianjin is the result of a creeping environmental disaster unfolding across the globe, particularly in Southeast Asia, and it reflects the magnitude of the challenge that the leaders of the 10 ASEAN nations face as they seek to balance both economic growth and natural resource protection. According to a 2013 World Bank report on climate change, Southeast Asian nations face disproportionate impacts in terms of sea-level rise, precipitation, related food insecurity and power challenges, and a host of other impacts. The Mekong delta, along with those of the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya, are especially at risk as stresses to their ever-growing urban populations increase. These nations include Malaysia, where illegal and unregulated bauxite mining raises fears of radioactive contamination in the region of Pahang. While regulated and closely monitored bauxite mining operations are largely considered safe and sustainable, in Malaysia this has not yet become the case. Largely due to repeated failures to enforce environmental and social safety standards, bauxite, much of which is sent to China for aluminum extraction processes, has leaked into water samples and left its toxic red dust in the wind, the sea, and the homes of villagers, resulting in serious health consequences for the population and the contamination of marine life. Meanwhile on Borneo Island, the lucrative global demand for palm oil is implicated in the nation's growing deforestation and wildlife management challenges.These threats also include environmental crimes that generate an estimated $23 billion per year, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The upcoming ASEAN discussions to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September will be focused on elevating environmental crime -- wildlife and timber trafficking among them -- to the status of transnational crime. ASEAN will address a constellation of factors that impact biodiversity, water resources and other factors that include rapid economic development at the expense of environmental protection and policy, poor enforcement of those policies, and the contextual arc of climate change. But even as they do, their trading partners -- including China, as well as the EU and Western leaders -- need to cooperate on environmental issues. The importance of prioritizing these climate issues can't be overstated.While other threats to these nations and their trading partners and investors do draw attention, the link between environmental crime and those threats -- including the funding of terrorist organizations -- may be more subtle. Protecting a sustainable future in Southeast Asia further depends on the affirmation and support of their counterparts in global trade. The overtures of British Prime Minister David Cameron during his July visit to Singapore focused on security and corruption, democratic reforms and infrastructure investments. But Cameron -- who also visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia -- just like other leaders, demonstrated far less concern for the threatened habitats of Southeast Asia, or the impacts of extraction and harvesting operations in one of the world's most fragile and biodiverse regions.Even as a stunned China tends to the unthinkable in its own environmental consequences, it must begin to rethink the economic development priorities of the future. With bilateral trade between China and ASEAN countries expected to reach $500 billion by the end of this year, that future is inextricably linked with the future of Southeast Asia. Indeed, the ASEAN bloc is China's third-largest trading partner, and examples include the first joint Malay-Sino industrial park -- in the state capital of that same Pahang Province where the toxic red dust of bauxite mines, often located in residential and school districts, contains arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel and other naturally-occurring radioactive materials. Each ton of aluminum destined for China requires four to five tons of bauxite, and produces three tons of toxic red mud that leads to increases in respiratory and skin inflammation symptoms in the affected communities, explains Dr. Hezri Adnan. For its part, Malaysia's government must enforce necessary health and safety guidelines and closely monitor the industry, which will remain a hazard to the environment and population if left unregulated.Ultimately, what China has so painfully learned in three decades of repeated regulatory and policy failures, and the lack of meaningful transparency surrounding it, has resulted in the tragic search for who is responsible and how they should be held accountable. That is exactly what ASEAN countries need to address now, and ensuring that environmental violations are treated as transnational crimes is a move in the right direction."}, {"title": "Not All Renewable Energy Is Created Equal", "text": "Renewable energy is hot right now. Maybe it's because renewables are rapidly becoming more affordable. Maybe it's because President Obama's recent publicity push surrounding his Clean Power Plan is driving interest in climate action. Or perhaps it's because Americans are fascinated by enigmatic entrepreneurs, and Elon Musk of Solar City and Tesla battery ambitions, seems to fit the bill. This discussion is badly needed and should be welcomed.Watching at least some presidential candidates competing over whose renewable energy plan is best is progress - even if some of them are still ignoring climate change. But plans to promote renewable energy should be carefully crafted and considered. Not all sources of renewable energy are the same. And not all types of renewable energy will benefit the environment or people and communities.For many, renewable energy is \"good\" energy - after all, it's not made from fossil fuels so it must be good for the environment and for people, right? Unfortunately, that's not always the case. When evaluating energy sources, we must not only consider greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, but other environmental impacts such as biodiversity, and air and water quality. Equally if not more important is the impact that producing this energy has on people and communities. Renewable energy policies must be crafted to support technology that meets all of these thresholds.Many types of solar and wind energy do indeed fit the bill. But n the other hand, corn ethanol and other first generation biofuels fail most, if not all, of these tests.Food-based biofuels contribute to hunger and undermine land rights around the world. They do this by diverting food crops, and agricultural inputs, to fuel production instead of food. The inflexible demand created by government mandates creates an upward pressure on prices, making food prices more unstable and raising them in the long term. Whether or not people can pay for food is a big part of why nearly 800 million people around the world are chronically malnourished.At the same time, land-intensive biofuels also help drive land grabs in developing countries, where smallholder farmers - who produce most of the food for local markets - are forced off their land, to make way for large mono-crop plantations.But that's not all. Corn ethanol also has a number of negative impacts on our environment. The demand for corn ethanol helps drive the expansion of agricultural land. But in changing the way the land is used to grow more crops, we are creating more emissions, particularly if the cleared land is established grassland or forests. Those emissions, combined with the emissions for the production and burning of ethanol, undermine any greenhouse gas emissions savings that this \"renewable\" fuel may have been provided.But it doesn't stop there. In order to get the corn to grow, we used more nitrogen fertilizer, but this runs off the fields, polluting our local waterways. Crop-based biofuels also promote large mono-crop plantations, which undermine biodiversity and disrupt local ecosystems.Taking all of this evidence together, surely it's past time to reform policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, which promote food-based biofuels that have such clear environmental and human costs?Don't get me wrong, transitioning to renewable energy is vital to our future. In fact, a transition to clean, affordable, reliable and safe renewable energy is a key part of the People's Test on Climate, which lays out civil society's red lines for the ongoing international climate negotiations that will culminate in Paris at the end of this year. But our experience with food-based biofuels must be a reminder that, even with a \"renewable\" label, energy sources must be closely examined and their impacts on both the environment and communities accurately assessed. The world, and its most vulnerable people, cannot afford anything less."}, {"title": "Bears Run Free After 20 Years In Tiny Cages", "text": "Forced to perform tricks and kept in tiny cages, four bears spent years languishing in a roadside zoo in Pennsylvania."}, {"title": "The Best Birthday Present for Our Parks", "text": "The National Park Service turns 99 this week, and in honor of its birthday, we all get a present: free admission to any national park of our choosing, from the Grand Canyon, to Yosemite, to Shenandoah.

The Land and Water Conservation Fund helped create the nation's first wildlife refuge, the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida.Left: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Credit: Shutterstock, Dave Allen Right: Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, Credit: Shutterstock, RIRF stockIn all, this premier land conservation program has protected more than 7 million acres of natural areas in every state in the country and created over 40,000 parks, preserves, and refuges.The conservation fund fosters what author Wallace Stegner called \"America's best idea,\" that precious natural areas should be setaside for all of the public and for future generations to enjoy. They should not be sold or given to private interests for short-term gain. Even better, the fund doesn't use taxpayer dollars; it derives its revenue from oil and gas companies leasing areas for drilling off our nation's coasts.Yet despite this dependable stream of revenue, Congress has repeatedly failed to fulfill the promise of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Nearly every year since the program's inception, lawmakers have diverted hundreds of millions of dollars of drilling revenue to other purposes. Land protection under the program has lagged, with a backlog of federal land acquisition needs estimated at more than $30 billion--including places vulnerable to development such as the Florida Everglades, Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona, Civil War battlefields in Virginia and other precious places around the country.Now, the future of the entire Land and Water Conservation Fund program hangs in the balance. Without action by Congress before September 30, the program will be left to languish.Shockingly, preventing new land from being protected is precisely the intention of some congressional leaders. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) has said the fund shouldn't be reauthorized unless it also trains new oil and gas workers. He also told reporters, \"There's no way in hell I'm going to allow you to spend that just to buy the inholdings,\" referring to the privately held land within our national parks vulnerable to development.Nonetheless, the Land and Water Conservation Fund enjoys bipartisan support, a rarity on Capitol Hill these days. Its staunchest champions include Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.). Earlier this year, key committee chair Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), together with ranking member Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wa.), introduced legislation to renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund before it expires.Our parks deserve what we all want on our birthday: friends coming together, setting aside their disagreements, and having a good time. Congressional friends of land protection need to do just that: put business as usual on hold, and renew and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. That would be an awesome birthday present for the Park Service and for all of us."}, {"title": "Poland's Drought Uncovers Soviet WWII Plane And Jewish Tombstones", "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — As Polish river levels fall to record lows amid a prolonged drought, the material remains of Poland's tortured 20th-century history are coming to light on newly exposed riverbeds, with Jewish tombstones and the human remains of Soviet fighter pilots and their plane being found in recent days.Those discoveries follow that of stone fragments from the early 20th-century Poniatowski Bridge across the Vistula River in Warsaw which the Germans blew up in 1944 as they crushed the Warsaw Uprising.\"The Vistula River is hiding no end of secrets. They are everywhere,\" said Jonny Daniels, the head of Jewish foundation \"From the Depths,\" who waded into a shallow area of the Vistula on Tuesday, picking up fragments of stones with Hebrew lettering.For the most part, officials knew that archaeological remnants remained hidden under wild and murky waters of the Vistula River or its tributaries. But it was simply impossible to carry out searches for them until now. Amid a prolonged drought, the Vistula, which flows 1,047 kilometers (651 miles) from the Beskidy Mountains to the Baltic Sea, is at its lowest level since measurements started in the late 18th century — leading explorers and fortune-hunters to comb riverbanks across the country.On Sunday, explorers found the remnant of the Soviet fighter-bomber plane in the Bzura River, a tributary of the Vistula, near the village of Kamion in central Poland. The pieces have been moved to a museum in nearby Wyszogrod for examination, with more recovery work planned for Saturday.The head of the museum, Zdzislaw Leszczynski, told The Associated Press that parts of Soviet uniforms, a parachute, a sheepskin coat collar, parts of boots, a pilot's personal TT pistol and radio equipment were found, along with a lot of heavy ammunition. The inscriptions on the control panel and on the radio equipment are in Cyrillic.The uncovered remnants are part of the larger story of a devastating war that played out across Poland from 1939-1945: a German invasion from the west, a Soviet invasion from the east, the murder of Jews across occupied Poland and fighting between the Soviets and Germans after Adolf Hitler turned on former ally Josef Stalin.Leszczynski said that witnesses had described the plane being hit while flying low in January 1945 and crashing down through the thick ice and into the river. At that time in the area, the German army was retreating toward Berlin before the Red Army's advance.\"Until now, the water level did not allow for the search and there was no one willing to enter this swamp,\" he said.Russian Embassy spokeswoman Valeria Perzhinskaya said she considers the discovery important and believes the crew could be identified by the numbers on the wreckage and could be properly buried. About 600,000 Soviet troops were killed fighting the German army on Polish territory.The Jewish tombstones that were found in Warsaw are believed to come from the Brodno cemetery in Warsaw's Praga district. Once the resting place of 300,000 Jews, only 3,000 tombstones remain there today; the rest were removed during and after the war and used as building materials and to reinforce the river's banks.Two weeks ago, a man walking along the river in Warsaw came across fragments of the tombstones with Hebrew lettering and took Daniels there on Tuesday. In the meantime, some had already been removed, though a few fragments were still lying on the riverbed. Now Daniels hopes to take students there to do a more thorough search and return anything he can find to the cemetery.\"Jewish history is buried in the Vistula,\" he said.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "H&M Is Offering $1 Million Prize For New Recycled Clothing Ideas", "text": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Hennes & Mauritz, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, is launching a new effort to promote recycling as it seeks to cut its environmental impact, boost its ethical credentials and address looming shortages of raw materials.The move comes as critics point out the damage being caused by a throwaway culture fueled by cheap clothing that has seen a sharp rise in the number of garments sold annually around the world.Sweden's H&M, which is launching a line of jeans containing recycled cotton next week, will offer an annual 1-million-euro ($1.16 million) prize for new techniques to recycle clothes, Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson told Reuters.\"No company, fast-fashion or not, can continue exactly like today,\" Persson said. \"The (prize's) largest potential lies with finding new technology that means we can recycle the fibers with unchanged quality.\"As population pressure mounts, retailers like H&M are concerned about potential future shortages of cotton, which is heavily water and pesticide dependent.Existing cotton recycling methods make poor-quality fibers, and there is no efficient way to recycle garments of mixed materials, so the vast majority of clothes end up in land fill.Johan Rockstrom, environmental science professor at Stockholm University and a jury member for the H&M prize, said the fashion industry needs to find new business models to respond to global resource shortages.\"This is a great challenge for H&M whose trademark is cheap clothes at good quality ... The fact it's cheap means there's a risk people buy and throw away, or buy too much,\" he said.H&M revenues have more than doubled since 2006, reaching 151 billion Swedish crowns ($18.3 billion) in the year to last November, making it the second biggest fashion retailer after Spain's Inditex.The award is being launched by a foundation established by H&M that is funded by the retailer and the Persson family, its main owners.INNOVATIONBernstein analyst Anne-Charlotte Windal said the industry's sustainability drive reflected the dilemma facing \"fast-fashion\" companies that constantly churn out new styles.\"The model only works if they encourage very frequent purchases, but the consumers are aware of the increasing effect it has on the environment,\" she said.Other companies are coming up with their own solutions.Mud Jeans is a Dutch company which leases its garments to consumers and then offers them a replacement each year, repairing and reselling the used ones or recycling the fabric.\"This is the future: producers that are responsible for their own waste,\" said Chief Executive Bert van Son.\"Our company can do this because we are quite small: that it is why we can do these kinds of crazy things because we can keep cotton pure. If you are a big store chain it is very complicated if you mix cotton and polyester.\"H&M joined forces earlier this year with Puma-owner Kering to support start-up Worn Again which is developing a technology for separating and extracting fibers in mixed-material garments.Meanwhile, a company called Re:newcell is developing a method to improve the quality of recycled cotton fibers and hopes to build a first factory in coming years.Currently, only about a maximum of 20 percent of recycled cotton can be used in a new pair of jeans because the fiber length is shortened in the shredding process, impacting quality, H&M says.H&M and Kering are not alone in beating the recycling drum. Like H&M, Britain's Marks & Spencer and Italy's Calzedonia collects used items in their stores for recycling.On a much smaller scale, Finnish entrepreneurs Pure Waste Textiles have managed to produce sweat shirts from 100 percent recycled cotton after improving existing recycling techniques and by recycling offcuts from clothes factories.However, others believe that recycling is just a distraction from the real challenge of the fashion industry: persuading customers to keep wearing their clothes for longer.To that end, British designer Tom Cridland is offering a 30-year guarantee on a range of T-shirts.\"I don't believe it is fair on customers to churn out plain white T-shirts that will only last a year or two,\" he said. \"I can't compete on price so I have to do something different.\"(Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson in Berlin; Editing by Pravin Char and Keith Weir)"}, {"title": "The Magical Moment When A Toddler First Feels The Rain", "text": "Dad Don Swift shared a special moment with his toddler daughter Harper when he took her outside to feel the summer rain for the first time.

To see a formerly abused dog enjoying these pleasures is something even more: it's a powerful argument in favor of second chances.Not long ago, dogs rescued out of fighting situations were euthanized, by default. It was thought they were too dangerous and too damaged to live safely and happily out in the world.That changed in 2008, when advocates convinced a federal judge to allow the Michael Vick dogs to be individually evaluated, so they could be rehabilitated and adopted into homes, where appropriate.The so-called \"Vicktory dogs\" proved that dogs are the most forgiving, most resilient creatures.But 12 states still punish these animal cruelty victims, by classifying dogs rescued out of fighting as \"vicious,\" like in California, or, even worse, mandating their death, like in Massachusetts.We intended to share a dozen stories of dogs rescued out of fighting -- one for each of these states, to show how utterly wrong it is to rescue a dog, and then penalize the animal for having been abused. But we couldn't quite keep ourselves to 12.

We found each other.\"Fritz notices the scars now. They make her hate whoever it is who is responsible for marking her dog's beautiful face, but they also give her hope.\"Alice is inspiring. She has come from such a hurtful and scary past, yet exudes such love and joy for life,\" she says. \"Just like people, a dog can leave a bad situation and appreciate their newfound happiness.\"Bonzai was one of the so-called \"Cleveland 27\" -- 27 chained, injured, sick and malnourished dogs, discovered in a suspected dog fighter's basement in late 2011.The dogs' owner went on to serve six months in jail, while the dogs themselves won their first taste of freedom.Sandy Smith knew that Bonzai could have serious medical and behavioral problems, relating to his past abuse. She was concerned about how he'd get along with her other five dogs, as well.But when she saw him at the shelter, she couldn't not take him home.\"He looked at me with such misery, and with such hope that maybe I was going to take him out of that place, that I immediately fell in love with him and I knew that I would move heaven and earth to keep him safe and help him learn how to be a happy dog,\" Smith says.Indeed, with time and training, \"Bonzai learned how to be a dog.\"\"He experienced joy. He felt safe. He knew love and he radiated love,\" says Smith. \"He was the most amazing creature I have ever known, the most heartbreaking, broken animal who was reborn and beautiful.\"Bonzai died in June. Smith says he changed her life, in the few years they had together.\"He taught me to be patient because he needed to experience life in his own way, at his own pace. He taught me what true forgiveness meant,\" she says. \"He taught me unconditional love.\"Jacqueline Johnson's most famous dog is Ray, who was one of the 51 dogs rescued out of Michael Vick's dog fighting operation in 2007.Back then, dogs rescued from fighting were euthanized as a matter of course. At the time of his rescue, advocates had to fight hard for Ray and the others to be given the chance to live.Ray recently died. His good life with Johnson and her husband, Kevin, helped prove to the world that being abused shouldn't lead to a death sentence. That it is right, and safe, for dogs to be given a second chance.Johnson and her husband have two other, slightly less high-profile dog fighting survivors, as well.McCaela the Turtle is another of the Fearing Six dogs.Bubba G -- found in Denver in March, with horrific injuries consistent with dog fighting -- came to live with the couple about a month and a half after Ray's death.All three of the dogs are characters, with different quirks and different personalities, but one big thing in common.\"These dogs know what a bad life looks like,\" Johnson says. \"And they appreciate their new lives more than I can explain.\"Peyton was sick, scarred and scared after his rescue from a Baltimore dog fighting bust in 2010. Despite his horrific upbringing, staff from the shelter where he was placed found Peyton -- and his fellow survivors -- to be \"loving and friendly.\"In January 2011, Eric Vocke and his wife, Kate, founders of the nonprofit Baltimore Bully Crew, took Peyton home.\"We were new to rescue at the time [but] our path was clear, these particular dogs being so tortured and abused were the ones we really wanted to work with,\" Vocke said.Peyton still has some health problems relating to his abusive past, but in his home and with his family, he has thrived. He's now a certified Canine Good Citizen -- that means he's passed a series of personality and behavioral tests -- on top of being a marvelous companion and an inspiration.\"Every day is truly a blessing with Peyton,\" Vocke says. \"He shows me every day how much he loves life and how much it is worth living.\"Sweet Pea was found in terrible shape, on a trash heap in New Jersey this past April. She was very badly injured, with swaths of raw skin and a missing ear. Because of her injuries, it's thought the animal had been used and then abandoned by dog fighters.In the short time since, she's become a poster dog for dog fighting awareness in New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie just signed legislation making dog fighting a criminal offense. She's also a canine blood donor, helping other injured pups heal.Sweet Pea is now under the care of foster mom Kathy McGuire, president of the nonprofit NJ Aid for Animals, who has discovered that this dog rather astoundingly emerged from a bad past to be agreeable in just about every way (except one: Sweet Pea doesn't like cats).\"She likes the car, walks, jogging, sleeping, watermelon, swimming,\" says McGuire. \"She is curious about everything, loves every single person she meets, including small children, sleeps soundly and snores and you can prod and poke and do just about everything.\"Next step: taking all that charm and all those snores to a permanent home. Here's information about adopting Sweet Pea.Rachel Johnson has a long list things she really loves about her dog Oscar, one of the 51 dogs rescued in 2007 from the Michael Vick dog fighting bust. Among them: listening to him snore, sniffing his frito-scented feet and their morning butt-scratching ritual.\"He comes over to me, turns his body away, and luxuriates in a good butt scratch,\" Johnson says. \"When he’s had enough, he simply walks away.\"Oscar passed his Canine Good Citizen test before Johnson adopted him in 2012, and he loves being around other dogs. Johnson loves meeting those dogs' owners, especially those who tirelessly work to make a better world for dogs like Oscar -- pit bulls and canine victims of abuse.\"Sharing my life with Oscar has brought so many wonderful people and experiences into my life,\" she says. \"Without even trying, Oscar has taught me to be more compassionate and empathetic. There is a lot of evil in the world, but instead of dwelling on it, I look at the good that is being done to combat that evil.\"Karma was one of the 400 dogs rescued as part of the 2009 \"Missouri 500\" dog fighting bust. She was probably a breeder dog for the dog fighters, since she was pregnant at the time of her rescue.Karma was physically well, but emotionally fraught, when Cliff Froehlich and Ledy VanKavage adopted her.\"She was scared of everything. On our first walk, at a trail near our house, she flattened to the ground at the first sight of a car, and it required a lot of time before she was able to go on walks without fear,\" Froehlich said.Over time, and with a lot of love, their girl came out of her shell. Today, Froelich describes Karma as \"an absolute delight.\"She is an friendly, enthusiastic companion, who loved going running (until a torn ligament benched her). She and the couple's cats even like grooming one other.And best of all, Karma \"loves, loves, loves people. She’s never met a person whom she doesn’t cover with kisses,\" Froelich says.He is so glad to give Karma the life she deserves.\"These dogs have been abused, pure and simple. They did not ask to be part of a dog fighting ring; they’ve been forced into the situation,\" he says. \"When they are rescued from such terrible fates, it seems incumbent on us to make every effort to bring them into loving homes and show them that not all humans behave in such reprehensible fashion.\"Lester spent the first six months of his life chained up outside, until he was freed in 2014, as part of a dog fighting bust involving 38 dogs.Lester was fearful when he went to his first foster home, through the rescue group Nashville Pittie. Within a year, he started showing a lot of pep -- maybe even a little too much, toward his canine foster siblings.About a month ago, Lester went to live with a new foster dad, Corey Macey, and Macey's cat, named Cat.Lester still shows anxiety when he meets new people. But Macey says that once he's comfortable, the doggie \"is the biggest cuddler I have ever seen.\"That includes cuddling with Cat, too.\"Nashville Pittie has allowed me to help give Lester a second chance and in return it makes me want to make sure Lester has the best chance at being a happy puppy,\" says Macey. \"I think every underdog has the capability of being on top when given the right circumstances.\"Bumper and Willis are the famous \"pit bulls in a photo booth\" doggies.They are also both dog fighting survivors.Bumper, the kisser, had been rescued from a St. Louis man who was trying -- unsuccessfully -- to fight her. She was adopted by Kelly Garrison and her husband, Jason, in 2009.Willis, the kissee, was born to a dog who was pregnant at the time of her rescue from the Missouri 500 dog fighting bust. He joined the family in 2010.Garrison says that living with these dogs for these years has been an incomparable joy.\"The best part of having them in our lives is the unconditional love they give us and the beautiful bond that grows between us,\" she says. \"They also teach us what true forgiveness is.\"Fay -- another of the Missouri 500 dogs; she became famous for her sweet disposition and missing lips -- is just one of the many, many dog fighting victims who's come through Gale Frey's home.Frey is founder of a St. Louis-based nonprofit called Mutts N Stuff. Since the rescue group began in 2000, Frey has adopted some dog fighting victims, fostered others, rehabilitated and found homes for more still.Sugarbear was the first. Rescued out of a drug bust in 2001, she was scarred, had clearly been overbred and was heartworm positive with skin ailments that the fighters had treated with motor oil.\"She became part of our family and lived until she was 15 years of age,\" says Frey.Fay died in 2009.\"She was as sweet as she could be even though horribly disfigured by mankind,\" says Frey. \"Fay now resides on my shelf. Safe from harm. Safe from those who wanted to exploit her. In a spot of honor and forever loved.\"Leo went from Michael Vick's dog fighting operation, to becoming a registered therapy dog.\"Leo made a huge impact on the world by changing hearts and minds everywhere, being the first to be a therapy dog out of the Vick case,\" says his adopter, dog trainer and rescuer Marthina McClay, hugging her baby in the photo above.Leo died in 2011, of brain disease.\"Leo was my working partner, friend and family loved one and I will never forget how wonderful he was,\" McClay wrote in a blog post, at the time.Today she says the same.\"He was enthusiastic about life, fun, playful and very loving. He loved to cuddle and watch TV with us. His big head would lay on our laps and then he was start to snore, that was the best part. He also love to snuggle in bed,\" McClay says. \"Leo was a sweet soul with a lot of love to give.\"Gabe Bravo and his wife, Nicole, met Acadia at a Florida vegetarian festival last winter. They felt a spark of interest right away.Then they found out she'd been rescued out of the Apopka dog fighting bust. Their feelings only grew stronger, and the couple adopted Cadi from the nonprofit Barkies Legacy.Cadi can be nervous around people she doesn't know but is loving with Bravo and Nicole, and she can't get enough of playing with other dogs.Her new family can't get enough of her.\"It is rewarding to know that you can make a difference in a dog’s life that really needed it,\" Bravo says. \"Cadi is a special dog. We love her.\"Rebekah Batyah Freedman wasn't sure that Pork Chop would ever be OK.Pork Chop is one of the 65 dogs rescued on Thanksgiving 2012, as part of Operation Broken Chain. At first, he was scared to eat and didn't wag his tail, he just seemed to want to disappear into the floor.\"I remember walking with an empty paper towel roll and when he saw it he cowered so quickly, it made me want to cry,\" says Freedman.Some two years later, these problems have not entirely gone away. Pork Chop isn't great with people he doesn't know and he can't go to dog parks. When he's feeling unsure, he hides.But he's feeling unsure less often, and for shorter amounts of time. And the rest of the time, he's wonderful.\"He is one of the silliest and sweetest doggies I've ever known,\" says Freedman.On sunny days, Pork Chop loves hanging out and nibbling grass in the yard at the Nashville home Freedman shares with her boyfriend, Jared, and their other dog Lola. The couple teases that he is part cow.Pork Chop also loves to gaze out the front window. He loves smooching and snuggling and romping with Lola. He loves following Freedman around, from room to room, being close to his favorite person.\"He persevered,\" says Freedman. \"Pork Chop has shown me what the power of love can do.\"Rhode Island-based dog trainer Heather Gutshall has two dogs rescued from fighting.Handsome Dan is a former Vick dog -- who is indeed, a gorgeous boy.Tillie is one of the so-called 367 dogs. She came out with bad medical problems -- among them, bowed legs and a body riddled with tumors.Tillie also came out with the gentlest, friendliest disposition you've ever come across. She wears pearls around her neck, and a big smile on her face.Gutshall, along with these two dogs, advocated for Rhode Island to become the most recent state to de-stigmatize dogs rescued out of fighting.It worked. Lawmakers took action, and as of July, dogs rescued out of fighting are no longer deemed vicious under the law in Rhode Island.Now there are just 12 states left, that continue to punish dogs like Handsome Dan and Tillie, and all these others, for the terrible things that have been done to them.\"Dan and Tillie just want to be dogs,\" says Gutshall. \"We are so happy that sharing their lives and stories of success will help other survivors of dog fighting have the same chance at a happy life. \"CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this story, Lester was said to have been freed as part of Operation Broken Chain."}, {"title": "5 Reasons Utilities Are Hating on Their Solar-Producing Customers", "text": "It seems crazy that electric companies would have anything against customers that spend their own money to reduce their energy use with clean, local solar power. But any number of utilities are slapping excessive fees and charges on customers with solar to slow or stop them. Here are five reasons why...1. Utilities Don't View Customer-Owned Solar Power as a ResourceMost utilities see a solar array on a customer rooftop the same as they see an energy efficient refrigerator. It means the customer buys less electricity. In some states, policies called \"decoupling\" tend to hold utilities harmless to these sales losses in order to encourage more investment in cost-effective energy efficiency. But with solar, utilities tend to ignore the benefits that this energy provides to the electricity system unless someone tells them to account for it.Read a utility integrated resource plan (their 15-year plan for the electric grid), and you can see an electric utility wax eloquent about a shiny new 100 megawatt power plant that could provide energy during peak energy periods with zero fuel cost. But if instead of a big utility-built power plant we're talking about 10,000 individual solar arrays on customer rooftops, utilities lose all perspective.In Minnesota, for example, the state legislature passed a \"value of solar\" program that requires the state's largest utility, Xcel Energy, to calculate how much solar energy is worth to its grid. In 2014 and 2015, the utility has reported that the value of solar energy is higher than the cost to the utility in buying it from customers via net metering. Other studies have shown similar results, including one in Maine, in Missouri, and in many other states.Faced with compelling evidence of the value of customer-produced solar power, why haven't utilities come around?2. The Utility Business Model Seems BrokenFor most investor-owned (for profit) utilities in particular, this new data can't be squared with their old business model. In a study by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, researchers found that the ratepayer impact of lots of customer-owned solar is quite small, but the larger impact falls on utility shareholders. Solar may mean modest revenue reductions for electric utilities, but by offsetting the need for new, large-scale power plants, solar's real threat is in choking off the for-profit utility's source of shareholder returns.In short, a utility that's spent the past several decades making money by selling more electricity and building new infrastructure doesn't look favorably on a competitor. Municipal utilities (owned by cities) and rural electric cooperatives (owned by their members) don't have this dissonance between shareholders and customers, but the notion of customer-provided power as a resource is often just as shocking. There are a few exceptions (noted later) but not many.3. It Seems Easier to Fight Than InnovateIn a competitive business it would seem mad to fight your own customers, but most utilities aren't in competition (even in states where there is competition in selling electricity to ultimate customers, the ownership of the distribution grid remains a monopoly). That means there are only a few prominent examples of utilities--such as Green Mountain Power and Farmers Electric Cooperative--working to change yesterday's business model to accommodate today's technology.For the rest of electric utilities, they've largely chosen to fight their customers rather than accommodate the rise of distributed, customer-owned renewable energy. But that choice is because while they see distributed renewable energy as an opportunity, most have no idea how to make a business around it.In Wisconsin, electric utilities have shifted more of the monthly bill onto fixed charges, reducing the incentive for their customers to save energy with solar (or any other manner). In Arizona, utilities are slapping fees on solar energy producers, to recoup their lost revenue. In over half of U.S. states (shown below in red), utilities have introduced legislative or regulatory proceedings to fight their customers over solar energy.The state-by-state battles are part of a coordinated effort by utility executives to address what they see as \"a serious, long-term threat to the survival of traditional electricity providers.\"So far, utilities have lost more than they've won, but even in winning individual battles utilities may still lose the war because their \"victories\" in containing customer generated solar power are temporary props to an electricity system that is increasingly archaic.4. The Electricity System is Fundamentally ChangingIt's easy to pick on electric companies for overlooking the value of their customer's energy (and for lashing out with retrograde policies), but it's not entirely their fault. The 100-year-old rules of the electricity system--written by legislatures and governed by public regulatory commissions--granted most electric companies a monopoly over their area of the electric grid. Even as some states introduced competition in selling power to ultimate customers, utilities maintain over the distribution poles and wires that bring power to homes and businesses (and thus much of the power). This monopoly made sense in the 20th century to raise capital for large-scale, low-cost power generation. It worked, giving us reliable and affordable electricity (at any environmental price). It gave utilities comfortable, reliable returns on their investments from regulators at Public Utilities Commissions.In an era of incremental change where stability was prized over innovation, this monopoly was largely in the public interest.No more.Consider the difference between a 20th century and 21st century electricity system. In the 20th century, power was generated in large-scale power plants at a distance from population centers, sent by large transmission lines to cities, and managed in a centralized, top-down fashion by a monopoly electric company. There was no viable alternative to this model.Today, we can generate power on rooftops or farm fields, manage it in real-time with smart thermostats or appliances, and control it remotely with smartphone apps and automation software. In this environment, do we need a traditional, top-down electric utility?Most utilities won't change by themselves, however. The inertia and cultural stagnation of monopoly make them much better at playing defense than offense. That has regulators in at least one state, New York, saying \"no.\"The Reforming the Energy Vision process just released its first orders, and among them the New York regulators are telling utilities that they will no longer own and operate distributed renewable energy resources. It's the first step toward flattening the electricity system, from a one-way, top-down grid to a massively networked and democratized energy delivery marketplace. Similar processes are underway in Washington, Minnesota, and other states.5. Electric Utilities Use Enormous Power to ResistImagine how typewriter companies felt upon the introduction of personal computers, how landline phone companies felt a decade ago. Electric utility executives are in a similar position, locked in an outdated paradigm and without a strategy for reaching a different future.The key difference is that electric companies wield enormous market and political power over their system. They have publicly-sanctioned monopolies, and huge streams of monopoly-shielded revenue they use to hire lobbyists and lawyers to dominate state legislatures and utility commissions. Open Secrets tracks electric utility lobbying at the federal level and reports that utilities collectively spent $121 million on lobbying Congress in 2014, and an additional $16.5 million in contributions to legislators. Lobbying is even more intense at the state level, where most regulation takes place. For example, Florida's four largest utilities collectively employ one lobbyist for every two legislators in that state.In nearly every fight to align the electricity system with the technological and economic opportunity--energy efficiency, renewable energy, net metering--utilities have pitted their resources squarely against progress.Get to the Root CauseThe best analog to today's battle for the electricity system might be the AT&T telephone monopoly. In the early years, users couldn't even connect third party devices to the telephone network and AT&T could wield its monopoly power to quash market or political competition. In the end, the government rightly recognized that breaking up the monopoly and introducing competition (for long distance service, at least) was the only way to reduce AT&T's economic and political power.Electric utilities are right that distributed renewable energy like rooftop solar threatens their business model. But that model is increasingly out of step with the interests of the modern electricity customer, from energy efficiency to clean energy to energy management. States have papered over the inconsistencies with policies mandating renewable energy and energy efficiency--the utility leaders in renewable energy and energy efficiency almost all hail from states with the best policies--but only at great political cost and over the strident objection of utility companies.The root cause of the battle between utilities and their (captive) customers is the utility monopoly. And the best hope for a democratic energy system may be to smash it.Photo credit: Mike Fleming via Flickr (CC BY 2.0 license)This article originally posted at ilsr.org.

Martin By Mark Tercek, Giulio Boccaletti and Brian StrankoLast week, government scientists issued their strongest forecast yet for what some are calling a \"Godzilla\" El Niño. It's looking more and more likely that the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean--which can trigger heavy rainfall over the western U.S.-- will bring some relief to drought-weary Californians.But will it be enough?In short, no. The last five years are the driest on the state's record book, and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada--which provides water to six in 10 Californians--hit an all-time low. Farmers and cities are tapping aquifers to maintain supply, but even those are drying up. Rivers and streams that support fish and other wildlife have been reduced to a trickle, and wetlands that provide homes to migrating birds are shrinking.Even a massive El Niño is unlikely to reverse a drought of these proportions. State water officials estimate it would take 150 percent of average annual precipitation totals to offset the state's massive water deficit. That's more than any El Niño winter on record.While Californians hope for rain, it remains crucial for the state to improve its long-term water management. Here are some steps to take right now.1. Measure it, so we can manage it: Currently, there's no way to accurately measure total water needs, water use and available supply in California. Real-time data on water needs and availability would enable the state to improve the precision of water flows to people and nature. The more precise we can be, the better we can allocate water and buffer the impact of future droughts.Measuring the water depth of irrigation ditches allows us to better manage water for cropland use. © Erika Nortemann2. Be smart about surpluses: Even as water efficiency increases, any surpluses should be treated with care. This is especially important in agriculture. Farmers are becoming better water managers, but their water savings shouldn't necessarily be applied to growing additional crops. Water efficiency is a great first step, but it's important to consider the most productive use of water across all needs.Water efficiency and smart use of water surpluses are important for all California stakeholders, especially farmers. © Chris Helzer3. Better manage infrastructure: California's vast network of reservoirs, aqueducts and tunnels is the largest \"plumbing system\" on the planet, but it's not living up to its full potential. Leaks, paired with evaporation, lead to significant water loss. Such water losses should be minimized, especially in places where groundwater supplies are declining.There are also big opportunities to better capture, store and deliver water for specific needs at particular times of the year--for example, pulse flows for salmon or refuge flooding for birds at the time of year they're needed and irrigation at other times.Existing manmade infrastructure, like this aqueduct, can be better managed to more effectively capture, store and deliver water for specific needs. © Flickr Creative Commons user Marianne Muegenberg Cothern4. Expedite groundwater reform: Groundwater accounts for one-third of the state's water supply in normal years and more than 60 percent in times of drought. Monitoring groundwater depletion and designing and implementing sustainable groundwater plans can go a long way toward solving the state's water challenge. Last fall, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation requiring local water agencies to adopt groundwater management plans. The new legislation should be put on an expedited path so it does not take years to implement.Legislation requiring agencies to adopt groundwater management plans can make a big difference in solving California's water challenge. © Flickr Creative Commons user Jim Bowen5. Invest in natural capital: Investing in watersheds and natural infrastructure--including restoring forests, meadows and wetlands--can optimize snowmelt, improve groundwater recharge and enhance flood protection while providing wildlife habitat. And by understanding natural water cycles, we can better balance the water needs of people and nature. California can mirror nature using its current built infrastructure, taking advantage of wet periods to fill reservoirs for release during dry periods.Investing in watersheds and natural infrastructure can secure water for people while providing improved wildlife habitat. © Simon WilliamsEven with some relief from El Niño in sight, drought will be an ongoing issue in California. It's critical that we take the long view through strategies like these. It's our best chance to ensure meaningful change that protects California's water future--for agriculture, the economy and the environment.Mark Tercek is the president and CEO of the Nature Conservancy and author of Nature's Fortune.

One of the lions known as Nxaha was collared,\" the parks agency said in a statement.\"It is further revealed that Nxaha jumped out at Quinn. All efforts to save Quinn were in vain,\" the statement said.Police are investigating the case but it was not immediately clear whether Swales was armed. None of the tourists were injured.Cases of people killed by wild animals in and around Zimbabwe's national parks often go unreported, and in the past, some lions that have killed humans have been shot.ZPWMA spokeswoman Caroline Washaya-Moyo said no decision had been made on whether Nxaha should be shot or not.Zimbabwe has charged two men in connection with the killing of Cecil, who was fitted with a GPS collar as part of an Oxford University study, and was lured from Hwange and shot by Palmer.Zimbabwe wants Palmer, 55, extradited from the United States to face trial.(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Angus MacSwan)Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Coca-Cola's Latest Environmental Victory Is More Complicated Than It Seems", "text": "Something as simple as water winds up becoming immensely complicated in the hands of a multinational corporation like Coca-Cola.On Tuesday, the company announced it had almost reached its goal of “replenishing” all of the water in the beverages it sold in 2014.Coke had pledged to “give back” every drop of water it put in its drinks, from Diet Coke to Minute Maid orange juice to, well, water. It sold $1 billion worth of its Dasani water in the 12-month period ending in May. Coke announced it had replenished 94 percent of the water used for all of its drink production, which translated to 126.7 billion liters.“As a consumer of water, the Coca-Cola system has a special responsibility to protect this shared resource,” Muhtar Kent, Coke’s CEO, said in a release.Coke said it didn't expect to reach its goal until 2020, and called this a \"significant announcement.\" And indeed, the news highlights the company’s serious efforts around water conservation -- it now recycles nearly all of its wastewater, and is partnered with a who's who of environmental groups. Yet when you unpack it a bit more, the news seems less clear-cut. If anything, Coke's replenishment announcement underscores the limits of corporate environmental activism.By “replenishing,” Coke does not literally mean it’s putting back the water it takes out of each locality where it operates. To come up with its number on replenishment, Coke and its partner, the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, measured the amount of water it reclaimed through various conservation efforts around the globe -- everything from tallgrass restoration in North Texas to reforestation in Ghana to canal rehabilitation in Kyrgyzstan. The company is involved in hundreds of these projects.“That’s not how it works,\" said Amit Srivastava of the India Resource Center, an activist group based in India that opposes corporate globalization in the country. “Water issues are local issues. You need to put water back at the source.\"Coke and other big beverage producers would be better off simply ceasing to manufacture drinks in drought-afflicted areas, he said.The beverage giant acknowledged to The Huffington Post that replenishment isn’t always a strict 1-to-1 replacement of local groundwater.“Yes, the water we’re replenishing isn’t directly the water we extract from, but we’re working to see that [production] is sustainable,” Greg Koch, the company's senior director of global water stewardship, told HuffPost from Stockholm, where he was attending the water conservation summit World Water Week. He noted that Coke requires all of its plants to adhere to guidelines around sustainability, and that the company wouldn't want to destroy the environment in which it operates.“It’s in our best business interest to make sure we’re doing something sustainable,” he said.The company certainly has upped its game on water conservation since it came under fire for the issue in 2001. Coke now recycles nearly all of the wastewater its plants create making drinks. The company has done a lot of good, partnering with reputable environmental groups like the World Wildlife Fund and Unicef for its environmental efforts.Over the past 12 years, Coke has also significantly reduced the amount of water it takes to produce a Coke (and any other beverage). Back in 2004, it took nearly 3 liters to make 1 liter of the sugary drink. Now it takes about 2, and even closer to 1 in some plants, according to a spokeswoman. Yet Coke does not take into account the amount of water it takes to collect the raw materials -- think sugar -- that go into its products. It also doesn't look at how much water it takes to produce its bottles and cans. The company said it's working with the World Wildlife Fund on efforts around \"reducing its environmental footprint.\"To come up with its replenishment number, Coke and the Nature Conservancy worked together on a methodology. That method was then confirmed in a report by Deloitte, the consulting firm, and LimnoTech, a water sciences and environmental engineering consulting firm. Coke paid both companies for their work.Coke recently came under fire after The New York Times reported the company was paying for academic research to underplay the link between sugary beverages and obesity.Back in the early 2000s, it wasn't obesity that fueled Coke's critics -- it was water. The company was harshly criticized for polluting the water system in India and diminishing an already scarce resource. The company even commissioned a report that actually suggested it consider halting its operations at some of its plants.The controversy spurred the company to do more. “The easiest thing would be to shut down, but the solution is not to run away,” Atul Singh, chief executive of Coke’s India division, told The New York Times in 2008 in regards to one plant. “If we shut down, Rajasthan is still going to have a water problem.

In just a three-month period this year, the company pulled in $12 billion in revenue."}, {"title": "Coca-Cola's Latest Environmental Victory Is More Complicated Than It Seems", "text": "Something as simple as water winds up becoming immensely complicated in the hands of a multinational corporation like Coca-Cola.On Tuesday, the company announced it had almost reached its goal of “replenishing” all of the water in the beverages it sold in 2014.Coke had pledged to “give back” every drop of water it put in its drinks, from Diet Coke to Minute Maid orange juice to, well, water. It sold $1 billion worth of its Dasani water in the 12-month period ending in May. Coke announced it had replenished 94 percent of the water used for all of its drink production, which translated to 126.7 billion liters.“As a consumer of water, the Coca-Cola system has a special responsibility to protect this shared resource,” Muhtar Kent, Coke’s CEO, said in a release.Coke said it didn't expect to reach its goal until 2020, and called this a \"significant announcement.\" And indeed, the news highlights the company’s serious efforts around water conservation -- it now recycles nearly all of its wastewater, and is partnered with a who's who of environmental groups. Yet when you unpack it a bit more, the news seems less clear-cut. If anything, Coke's replenishment announcement underscores the limits of corporate environmental activism.By “replenishing,” Coke does not literally mean it’s putting back the water it takes out of each locality where it operates. To come up with its number on replenishment, Coke and its partner, the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, measured the amount of water it reclaimed through various conservation efforts around the globe -- everything from tallgrass restoration in North Texas to reforestation in Ghana to canal rehabilitation in Kyrgyzstan. The company is involved in hundreds of these projects.“That’s not how it works,\" said Amit Srivastava of the India Resource Center, an activist group based in India that opposes corporate globalization in the country. “Water issues are local issues. You need to put water back at the source.\"Coke and other big beverage producers would be better off simply ceasing to manufacture drinks in drought-afflicted areas, he said.The beverage giant acknowledged to The Huffington Post that replenishment isn’t always a strict 1-to-1 replacement of local groundwater.“Yes, the water we’re replenishing isn’t directly the water we extract from, but we’re working to see that [production] is sustainable,” Greg Koch, the company's senior director of global water stewardship, told HuffPost from Stockholm, where he was attending the water conservation summit World Water Week. He noted that Coke requires all of its plants to adhere to guidelines around sustainability, and that the company wouldn't want to destroy the environment in which it operates.“It’s in our best business interest to make sure we’re doing something sustainable,” he said.The company certainly has upped its game on water conservation since it came under fire for the issue in 2001. Coke now recycles nearly all of the wastewater its plants create making drinks. The company has done a lot of good, partnering with reputable environmental groups like the World Wildlife Fund and Unicef for its environmental efforts.Over the past 12 years, Coke has also significantly reduced the amount of water it takes to produce a Coke (and any other beverage). Back in 2004, it took nearly 3 liters to make 1 liter of the sugary drink. Now it takes about 2, and even closer to 1 in some plants, according to a spokeswoman. Yet Coke does not take into account the amount of water it takes to collect the raw materials -- think sugar -- that go into its products. It also doesn't look at how much water it takes to produce its bottles and cans. The company said it's working with the World Wildlife Fund on efforts around \"reducing its environmental footprint.\"To come up with its replenishment number, Coke and the Nature Conservancy worked together on a methodology. That method was then confirmed in a report by Deloitte, the consulting firm, and LimnoTech, a water sciences and environmental engineering consulting firm. Coke paid both companies for their work.Coke recently came under fire after The New York Times reported the company was paying for academic research to underplay the link between sugary beverages and obesity.Back in the early 2000s, it wasn't obesity that fueled Coke's critics -- it was water. The company was harshly criticized for polluting the water system in India and diminishing an already scarce resource. The company even commissioned a report that actually suggested it consider halting its operations at some of its plants.The controversy spurred the company to do more. “The easiest thing would be to shut down, but the solution is not to run away,” Atul Singh, chief executive of Coke’s India division, told The New York Times in 2008 in regards to one plant. “If we shut down, Rajasthan is still going to have a water problem. We want to work with farming communities and industries to reduce the amount of water used.”Since then, Coke has put a lot of money and effort into becoming a better corporate citizen when it comes to water.

And on top of that, the beef produced on feedlots with antibiotics had twice the number of superbugs as beef produced in a sustainable fashion.For the new report, the magazine's research team bought 300 packages of conventionally and sustainably-produced (meaning organic, grass-fed or both) ground beef from grocery, big-box and natural food stores across 26 U.S. cities. They then tested each sample for the five most common types of bacteria associated with beef in cases of food poisoning: clostridium perfringens, E. coli, enterococcus, salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.Their testing, which is one of the largest to be completed to date, found bacteria on  every single one  of the beef samples. However, it did find that ground beef from sustainably-raised cows raised was significantly less affected by harmful bacterias S. aureus and E. coli than their conventional counterparts.According to the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, the bacteria in beef is often spread via the grinding process, which is why your favorite cut of steak is less likely to make you sick than a hamburger. The degree to which meat is cooked also impacts potential exposure to bacteria -- the only way to guarantee that you've killed all risky ones is to make sure the meat reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit on the grill.Food poisoning hits an estimated 48 million people in the U.S. each year, and beef is to blame for a substantial proportion of these incidents. So if you're still planning on busting out your famous burger recipe in the coming weeks, invest in the higher quality beef and make good use of that food thermometer.

Over the course of this week, Sierra Club experts are adding to this series of posts on Sierra Club's Compass blog with more posts on what's new in this plan and its effects on coal, environmental justice, labor, policy, and international climate negotiations (coming soon!).This piece was co-written by Mary Anne Hitt and Liz Perrera, Climate Policy Director at the Sierra Club.  The final Clean Power Plan is the most significant single action any president has taken to date to tackle climate disruption. It establishes the first-ever set of national carbon limits on power plants, our biggest source of the pollution that's throwing our climate into chaos. It's also a game-changer for clean energy, because it creates big, important new opportunities for renewable energy and energy efficiency in every state. This post provides an overview of the clean energy elements of the Clean Power Plan.The Clean Power Plan opens up the opportunity for every state to chart its clean energy future and rapidly expand renewable energy generation. And the Clean Power Plan is happening at just the right time, because clean energy is becoming cheaper every month and is outcompeting dirty fuels in the marketplace at a rapidly accelerating rate. Wind reached nearly five percent of US electricity demand in 2014, at an average of 5.9 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), as compared to an average 10.9 cents per kWh for coal and 7.4 cents per kWh for natural gas, and its technical resource potential has increased due to newer wind turbines designed for areas with lower wind speeds. Meanwhile, some of the latest solar projects are offering power at prices cheaper than coal or natural gas. In addition, innovative approaches to community solar, like Maryland's community shared solar program, are popping up all over the country.But what does the Clean Power Plan mean for the future of clean energy, and how has EPA improved its approach to renewable energy in the final version of the plan?EPA's draft version of the Clean Power Plan, released in June 2014, vastly underestimated the role that renewables could play in our electricity market and used outdated data for renewable energy that did not reflect the current market conditions or recent technologies. There was a broad consensus among environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and the Union of Concerned Scientists, as well as clean energy companies and renewable energy trade associations like the American Wind Energy Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association, that EPA needed to improve its methodology in order to incorporate the true power and growth of renewables.Senator Merkley (D-OR) and eleven other senators, also sent a letter to EPA detailing how the agency could update and improve their methods for calculating clean energy potential in the Clean Power Plan. After carefully reviewing these submissions, EPA ended up making substantial changes in the final standard that are widely beneficial.Here are four ways the Clean Power Plan has improved its approach to renewables and energy efficiency:1. EPA recognized that the grid and renewable potential are regional: EPA revised the plan to better account for the regional nature of the electric grid and used an improved methodology to estimate the regional technical potential of renewable energy. The agency then used that as a basis to set state targets across each region, in a manner that would align better with existing renewable standards. The end result -- state carbon reduction targets that incorporate much larger projected growth in renewable energy, which reflects the rapid rise of renewables actually underway in many states.2. EPA used better renewables data and included distributed generation: EPA used better, more current data to evaluate renewable resource potential for calculating state carbon reduction targets, and also included distributed generation technologies (power that's generated on the site where it's used, like rooftop solar, and not at a distant power plant), as a measure states can use to comply with the standard. Distributed generation is on the rise, providing a significant and increasing portion of renewable energy production, and utilities are not only increasing distributed energy within their energy portfolios, but are also purchasing renewable credits from distributed energy. The final Clean Power Plan creates a framework that will encourage these good trends to grow.3. EPA recognized renewables can directly replace dirty energy: EPA improved the way renewable energy is calculated towards a state's carbon reduction target by reflecting what actually happens on the grid -- when new renewables are added, they displace dirty coal generation. The final plan relies much more heavily on investment in new renewables rather than natural gas and now expects gas-fired generation to increase no more than would have occurred anyway under a business-as-usual scenario -- a significant reduction from the gas projections in the draft Clean Power Plan.4. Clean Energy Incentive Program gives renewables an early push: Under the Clean Power Plan, states are expected to submit a final plan to meet their carbon reduction target by September 2018 at the latest, and all states must begin complying with their plans in 2022. To ensure renewable energy projects built before 2022 are getting proper credit, the EPA developed the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) as an option for states, and has also proposed to incorporate the CEIP as a mandatory element of the draft federal plan for states that don't submit a plan of their own.Through the CEIP, states will have the opportunity to award early compliance credits (CO2 allowances or Emission Reduction Credits) to wind and solar projects. Renewable projects that start construction after a state's compliance plan is finalized (or after September 6, 2018 for states that do not submit a compliance plan) will be eligible for credits for the energy they produce in the years 2020 and 2021. States can also grant early credits to providers of energy efficiency projects in low-income communities that reduce energy use in 2020 and 2021. For every credit a state grants to an eligible project, EPA will grant a matching credit for renewable projects. Energy efficiency projects get double matching credits. Across all states, EPA will provide up to the equivalent of 300 million tons of CO2 allowances of matching credits. The voluntary program should give states a jumpstart on their compliance strategies and help keep the momentum in renewables deployment going. This coupled with renewal of federal renewable energy incentives, the wind Production Tax Credit and the solar Investment Tax Credit, can keep our momentum on renewables growing throughout the country.Thanks to these changes, EPA has greatly increased projections of renewable energy deployment in the final Clean Power Plan.The EPA estimates that the final rule could result in 706,000 GWh of new renewable generation by 2030 (for comparison's sake, that's the equivalent of 45 percent of the generation from coal-fired power plants in 2013), compared to the proposal's estimates of 305,000-335,000 GWh. Under the Clean Power Plan, EPA projects renewables could account for as much as 28 percent of the nation's overall electricity generation mix by 2030, versus approximately 22 percent in the proposed plan and 13 percent today.Overall, the Clean Power Plan is poised to be a game changer for clean energy. Now, it's up to each one of us to get involved with the creation of state plans, and make sure it delivers.---Sierra Club Clean Power Plan Blog Series - Coal Impacts Blog Post- Environmental Justice Impacts Blog Post (En Español)- Labor Impacts Blog Post (En Español)- Policy Impacts Blog Post- International Impacts Blog Post (Coming Soon)"}, {"title": "This Is Exactly What's Wrong With Raising Baby Animals In Captivity", "text": "A tiny jaguar baby was born in March at the San Diego Zoo, and attendees were extremely excited — perhaps, a little too excited."}, {"title": "The Challenge for China's Lungs", "text": "A study recently released by Berkeley Earth made for sobering reading. The authors find that air pollution contributes to 1.6 million deaths a year in China, about 17% of deaths in the country.Coal burned to supply power to China's economic miracle is a source of a type of pollution called particulate matter -- toxic particles linked to serious health problems, including asthma, lung cancer, heart attacks, and strokes.The death toll clearly worries officials responsible for cleaning up the problem. Senior Chinese officials say that they are proud of raising more people out of poverty than any country in history, but that they did not get the balance right, favoring development too much over environmental health. They are right about the feat of raising so many out of poverty. And they are now focused on the environmental problems.The government acknowledges the crisis, and is transparent about the data. The Berkeley Earth study used data from Chinese monitoring stations. And the government has made real time emissions data from polluting factories available online to the public.The desire to tackle the problem goes to the top of the Chinese Communist Party.

The door to enforcement is open for around five hundred Chinese environmental groups. Several have quickly taken action--we know of six enforcement actions that have already been filed, with more on the way.These are positive developments and suggest that China has reached a tipping point in how it deals with pollution.

Rampant corruption has plagued Peru's forest sector, allowing timber mafias to use fraudulent documents in order to obtain permits that they use to illegally harvest timber. According to a study by the World Bank, up to 80 percent of the timber exported from Peru has illegal origins. A new documentary from Al Jazeera shows just how widespread illegal logging is in Peru and how that illegal wood is making its way to the United States.With illegal logging and associated trade as pervasive as it is, you may be surprised to learn that the United States has a trade agreement with Peru, passed in 2007, that includes a detailed set of binding obligations to curb illegal logging and associated trade. As we've previously discussed, these obligations have failed to stem the problem. And as the new Al Jazeera documentary makes evident, the failure to enforce violations of the U.S.-Peru free trade trade pact in its early years has allowed bad actors to continue to operate and enabled illegal wood to enter the U.S. market. The result? American businesses have been undercut by the entry of cheap illegal products into our market, and American consumers have financed illicit trade by unknowingly purchasing timber illegally harvested from Peru's Amazon rainforest.Here is some background. In 2012, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) published a multi-year investigative report which documented that at least 112 illegal shipments of cedar and mahogany wood -- laundered with fabricated papers and approved by the Peruvian government -- arrived in the U.S. between 2008 and 2010. EIA identified Oroza Wood SAC as one of the entities supplying illegally taken timber to Maderera Bozovich SAC, which would then export the illegal timber to the U.S.Using rules in the U.S.-Peru free trade pact, EIA and the Center for International Environmental Law petitioned the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to take action under the trade pact and verify the legal origin of shipments from two companies, including Maderera Bozovich SAC, because of their history of exporting significant volumes of timber to the U.S. from logging concessions with illegal activity. But USTR never did so, and the illegal activity continued.Over the past two years, Peru's customs and forest management agencies have conducted investigations to check the legality of timber exports. As a part of the latest investigation, as Al Jazeera documented, Peruvian officials found that several shipments from a company called La Oroza had falsified documents, claiming that the wood was legally cut on land belonging to an indigenous community when instead it had been illegally taken elsewhere. This is particularly significant because La Oroza is owned by the same proprietors as Oroza Wood SAC, which EIA identified in 2012 as a supplier of illegally harvested timber to Maderera Bozovich SAC. Because USTR and Peruvian officials failed to investigate the well-documented violations back in 2012, the owners of Oroza Wood were able to continue operating, under a slightly different company name, illegally.Al Jazeera then followed the illegal shipments of timber from La Oroza to the United States. The main American importer of La Oroza's wood is a company called Global Plywood and Lumber which is registered in Nevada (a state notorious for its lack of corporate ownership transparency, as EIA explains) and operates in Poway, California from the backroom of a volleyball training facility. No one has yet to trace where the wood from Global Plywood has gone, but it could be anywhere--including your floor.The lack of enforcement of the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement has allowed the illegal timber trade to flourish and has put our environment, climate, businesses and consumer rights at risk. And now the United States is negotiating a new free trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), that includes the U.S., Peru, and ten other countries. The fact that Peru is ignoring its existing obligations gives us little reason to believe it will make good on any environmental rules that may be included in the TPP's environment chapter. Therefore, if the TPP concludes, Congress should withhold its vote on the agreement until Peru has addressed these past violations and until it has come into compliance with its new obligations in the TPP.Luckily, the trade pact isn't the only tool to combat illegal logging and associated trade. Timber harvested illegally in Peru and shipped to the U.S. represents a violation of the Lacey Act, which requires companies to take due care in ensuring their wood products are sourced legally. Violators of the Lacey Act can face fines or jail time. But a law is only as effective as its enforcement, so please help by telling the Obama administration to crack down on companies that knowingly import illegal wood products and to fully enforce the Lacey Act.Image source: iStock/Rex_WholsterThis post originally ran on the Sierra Club's blog, Lay of the Land."}, {"title": "Tesla Wants To Take Stress Out Of Vacationing With An Electric Car", "text": "Tesla just found a new way to deal with \"range anxiety.\"The electric automaker -- long dogged by drivers' concerns that their batteries would run low too far from home or a charging station -- partnered last week with home-sharing service Airbnb to install chargers in a handful of hosts' homes.The rollout will be limited at first. For now, only Airbnb hosts with a minimum four-star rating after at least five bookings are eligible. The hosts must list the entire home. Though the $750 charger is free for eligible hosts, they must still pay an electrician to install the device, which can cost up to $900.The offer is restricted to California, though the companies plan to expand to other locations at an unspecified later date.Tesla has struggled to quell anxiety over traveling distances in its signature Model S since The New York Times infamously published a review of the sedan in 2013, arguing that the car stalled out on a highway when the battery died. CEO Elon Musk aggressively debunked the story, arguing in a blog post that the journalist failed to meet all the factory specifications to milk the charge for its furthest possible range.In March, Tesla upgraded its software to integrate charging stations into navigation routes, communicate with a network of charging stations and warn the driver if the vehicle is out of range.While its new partnership with Airbnb may be partly a public relations stunt, it proves that, when connected with a network of available rentals, drivers could reasonably plan road trips and rely on other Tesla owners to keep their vehicles charged. It's a model that can scale.That isn't to say Airbnb isn't getting something out of it, too. Tesla, for now, is a luxury automaker.

The things we think without even knowing we think them. I won't say more than that in regards to the qualifier phenomenon than that, I'll just throw that out to put in your noggin.The irksome thing about Qualifiers (aside from trying to come up with a response to someone helpfully telling me my puppy probably won't become a flesh eating, toddler hunting monster) is that theyr'e usually the biggest proponents of pit bulls when there's no actual pit bull owners around.Hence whenever the pit bull argument comes up when I'm not around, the same people defending my dog are the same ones who believe that he is, as I stated, one shade of nose color or skipped training class away from multiple homicide. The same folks that believe that he is, by nature, violent and unpredictable and only vigilance can keep him from his true nature.That scares me more than the haters.No one is doubting that pits are large, strong dogs who need training. No one is saying that some of them have been bred to be aggressive. What I am saying is all dogs need training and an understanding of what they're capable of. That's called responsible pet ownership and I've spent most of my life advocating for that.What I am saying is that my dog is a member of my family.If you hate my dog, I'm sorry you feel that way. In all likelihood I won't change your mind so just cross the street and I'll smile politely.If you support my dog but you're apologizing for him while you're defending him, please don't defend him. Please just cross the street instead. You're doing Waylon more harm than good. You're perpetuating more myths than all those stink-eyed haters.This week is Pit Bull Appreciation Week. I'm not asking anyone to love pits. I'm just asking for one week where Waylon gets to be exactly what he is: The World's Best Puppy.No ifs, ands, or buts.*We adopted a dog. We didn't make a political statement. We're not supporting an orphanage full of war refugees. We're not sure what we're doing except, you know, raising a puppy.**This is an editorial.

Public officials, policy experts, investors, industry executives, students and eager citizens will gather to listen to and discuss America's most pressing and compelling energy and climate issues with panels of experts and innovators, teed up by President Obama himself.You see, right now, clean energy discussions are taking center stage not just in western states like Nevada where the renewable energy sector is rapidly growing, but across the country, and for good reason. Earlier this month President Obama and the EPA unveiled a  Clean Power Plan (CPP) for America, a critical part of the president's overarching Climate Action Plan. In our country's most ambitious action yet taken to combat the impacts of climate change, the CPP sets the first-ever limits on dangerous carbon emissions from power plants, gives states the opportunity to craft implementation plans tailored to their needs and provides opportunities for new jobs and lower energy costs across America.We know that fossil-fuel generated power plants are the leading source of the carbon pollution that causes climate change and has devastating effects on human and environmental health. We also know that climate change is compounding the effects of pollution, development and habitat loss on our nation's - and world's - imperiled wildlife, from Arctic species like polar bears and walruses to amphibians around the world, as well as the songbirds that visit my backyard each spring. If we do not work now to curb the impacts of climate change on species, one in six wildlife species could face extinction in the next 75 years.This is an outcome that is simply unacceptable. Fortunately, the CPP gives us an opportunity to come together to ensure that our children and grandchildren live in a world that is not missing turtles, frogs and polar bears, along with hundreds of other species. To successfully help turn the tide on extinction, increased investments and research in and development of renewable energy projects are key. Corporate and private investments in small scale technology like rooftop solar panels are an important part of the needed road map for this country to follow. But we also believe that substantial growth in large-scale wind, solar and geothermal projects will be essential in the transition to a more efficient clean energy economy. The challenge before us is that while some of the best opportunities for renewable energy development are on public lands, these lands are also home to many imperiled species and their habitat.There is a right way and a wrong way to develop utility-scale renewable energy projects on public lands and I have seen both take place over the last few years. For example, right now in the California desert - home to some of our country's most unique and threatened plants and animals - the Bureau of Land Management is working with the state and local communities on a multi-stakeholder effort called the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) to identify the \"low conflict\" places in the desert for renewable energy development, which avoid areas important for imperiled wildlife, wilderness, recreation and other public land values. This is an important process because when we don't work together to avoid serious wildlife and habitat impacts before launching renewable energy development projects, we end up with situations like the poorly located solar energy projects in the Ivanpah Valley in Nevada and California. This valley is being heavily burdened with too many large-scale renewable energy projects that have serious consequences for the sensitive species there like big horn sheep, desert tortoise and golden eagles, as well as other important land resources and values.Defenders of Wildlife has been at the helm of forging many successful partnerships with agencies, industry and developers to advance policies and on-the-ground solutions for developing projects in a way that protects and preserves high value wildlife habitats. And we must continue to encourage responsible renewable energy that is smart from the start - planned, placed and operated in a way that does not sacrifice irreplaceable lands and wildlife resources. Looking to the future, I feel emboldened by the step America is taking with the President's CPP, and I am excited to build on the work that has already taken place to make sure our new clean energy economy works for people and imperiled wildlife alike."}, {"title": "The Intersection of Water, Energy and Climate", "text": "This week, global experts gather in Stockholm for World Water Week amidst a backdrop of water-related crises worldwide. The U.S. state of California is experiencing a record-breaking four-year drought. Brazil and South Africa have electricity, water and food supply shortages due to low precipitation. Puerto Rico residents are also feeling the pinch, with rations limiting tap water access to just twice a week. This issue of water and climate change is central in this week's discussions, with the UN Climate Change Conference set to negotiate a global climate action agreement beginning in just three months.While renewable energy is widely acknowledged as an important tool to mitigate climate change, its role in water conservation is not so recognized. Water is an essential ingredient in the energy production process. In the EU for example, energy production accounts for 44 percent of total water use. Conversely, energy is also needed to process water for consumption. By 2050, the global population will demand roughly 80 percent more energy and 55 percent more water than today. Meeting these growing demands is a tremendous challenge, given competing needs for limited resources amid heightened climate change effects.This is where renewable energy has a role to play in the water-energy-climate nexus. During power generation, solar power withdraws 200 times less water than a coal power plant to produce the same amount of electricity. Wind power requires no water. IRENA analysis finds that doubling the share of renewable energy, in particular solar PV and wind, could reduce water withdrawals in the power sector as much as 52 percent in the UK, 37 percent in the US, 32 percent in Australia, 28 percent in Germany and 12 percent in India. The European Wind Energy Association found that wind energy in the EU avoided the use of 387 billion litres of water in 2012 -- equivalent to the average annual water use of 3 million EU households -- and the American Wind Energy Association found that wind energy saved 257 billion litres of water nationwide in 2014, 13 billion alone in the drought-prone state of Texas.Achieving the massive scale-up of renewable energy needed has never been more achievable than it is right now. Renewable energy has beat out fossil fuels as the cheapest source of power in many parts of the world. We also have the technology and the means to integrate variable renewable energy technologies into the electricity grid, creating jobs along the way. The business case for renewable energy as a water-saving mechanism is also strong. In a Carbon Disclosure Project survey of Global 500 companies, 82 percent of energy companies and 73 percent of utilities found that water shortages were a substantial risk to business operations and 59 percent of energy companies and 67 percent of utilities had experienced water-related business impacts in the past five years.Low-cost, low-carbon, water-saving renewable energy is increasingly seen as the key to ushering in a sustainable energy future on a global scale. In the U.S., President Obama recently revised his clean power plan, which places significant emphasis on wind and solar power along with other renewable energy sources, to displace coal-fired power plants and cut greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power stations by nearly a third within 15 years. In Sweden, the government is proposing a 5 Terawatt increase of the production of renewable energy by 2020 -- equivalent to the electricity consumption of one million Swedish homes. China is targeting a massive 200 Gigawatts (GW) of onshore wind power and 100 GW of solar PV by 2020. India has committed to 100 GW of solar PV and 40 GW of wind by 2022. Worldwide, 164 countries now have renewable energy targets, up from just 43 countries in 2005.In our globalized world, everything is interconnected. Water, energy and climate can no longer be thought of as separate issues. The only effective, immediately available solution to meet the rising demand for water and energy, while also mitigating climate change, is to scale up renewable energy and phase out fossil fuels. This shift is happening, but not fast enough. It's now up to global policy makers, governments, investors and the private sector to build on the growing momentum and throw their weight behind the ongoing global energy system transformation for the benefit of our economy, our society and our environment."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Reclaiming the Kitchen", "text": "We're not getting fatter. That's the good news. Considering adult obesity rates have doubled and childhood obesity tripled in the past generation, the CDC's evidence we've started to stabilize deserves a victory lap. No doubt we need the exercise.Exercise does't seem to be what's slowed the obesity epidemic, though. Researchers point to -- hallelujah -- people making more conscious food choices. My favorite way -- eating less processed, more produce. It's a sure way to lose weight, too.We're also consuming fewer calories, especially those in liquid form. We're dialing back on the supersize sugar-laden sodas and caramel mocha frappes, extra whip. Foods we once enjoyed without thinking suddenly aren't so delicious now that chain restaurants and movie theaters are complying with FDA mandates to post menu item calorie, fat, sodium and sugar content (I'm talking to you, Cheesecake Factory, Starbucks and Pizza Hut).Now's our chance to take it a step further -- to reclaim our kitchens. Most Americans eat products not food. Packaged foods sales are forecast to hit by 2020. The supermarkets are filled with them -- drops that chemically flavor your water, sandwich kits. You don't have to be a chef on \"Chopped\" or spend all day in the kitchen to create a meal that nourishes and pleases. You don't need a kit to make a sandwich. Make it yourself. You want flavored water? Squeeze in some lemon or orange.This is not what food corporations want. They spend over $17 million lobbying Congress --and they're not advocating Americans eat more broccoli. You're not drinking as many sodas as you used to? Coca-Cola isn't taking that lying down. Citing info from Global Energy Balance Network, a nutrition nonprofit they helped fund, the company is launching campaign saying don't blame sugar for your weight gain, it's your fault for not exercising more. But have another Coke.Would that we could trust food conglomerates to have our best interests at heart. We can't. We have to eat -- and drink -- defensively. That why I call for everyone to DIY their dinner more often, to turn off the TV and turn on the oven. You don't have to be a chef on \"Chopped\" or spend all day in the kitchen to create a meal. You've got 10 minutes, feed yourself.Cooking is cheaper than eating out, it's nourishing, delicious and educational -- you see exactly what's going into what you feed yourself and your family. And it's empowering. Cooking is a basic life skill with benefits far beyond the next meal. As I mention in Psychology Today , it's good for you.When we reclaim the kitchen, we're sticking it to the man, saying no to processed food and drink's extra calories, fat , sugar and salt and no to obesity. Because we're still fat. The average American is carrying 25 more pounds than he did in the 1960s. That's a lot of extra jiggle and it comes with a lot of extra health costs. The CDC estimates current national obesity-related medical costs to be somewhere between $150 and $200 billion a year.Conscious eating is how we've started to put the brakes on obesity. Let's keep it going. Change happens one meal at a time. Start by making yourself a sandwich.Hold the Egg Salad aka Vegan Eggless Salad   Creamy, comforting and so basic, it's barely a recipe. Firm tofu stands in for hard-boiled eggs, offering all of the protein and none of the cholesterol or cruelty. Mustard, turmeric and nutritional yeast add a depth of flavor and echo the sunny color in egg yolks. Feel free to customize with your favorite egg salad add-ins such as sweet pickle relish, chopped olives, a dash of paprika or curry powder or a tablespoon or two of your favorite fresh herbs, finely chopped. It will taste like your childhood favorite and won't come from a kit."}, {"title": "White House Announces Plans To Boost Renewable Energy Use", "text": "LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday expanded his push for greater renewable energy adoption, announcing fresh financial incentives for solar power development and use.The steps include an additional $1 billion in loan guarantees for new research projects and near-term savings for homeowners using renewable energy.Speaking at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas, Obama argued fossil fuel proponents who say renewable energy is too expensive are being proven wrong as power sources like solar and wind become cheaper.\"For decades we've been told that it doesn't make sense to switch to renewable energy. Today that's no longer true,\" Obama said, laying out the cost savings realized by companies and states using more renewable energy.The moves are part of Obama's broader plan for ameliorating the effects of climate change, which he will illustrate throughout the next week in trips to New Orleans and Alaska.They come after Obama's announcement earlier this month to limit carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.That plan mandated a shift to renewable energy from coal-fired electricity to fight climate change, which Obama has called the greatest threat facing the world. Critics have said moving away from carbon-producing energies will drive up costs.Under the new rules, homeowners who adopt renewable energy will be able to do so with no cost upfront and pay back the cost of installation over time through property taxes.Monday's announcement also called on Department of Energy to make an additional $1 billion out of an existing $10 billion available in loan guarantees for renewable energy projectsThe Department of Interior on Monday approved the Blythe Mesa Solar project in California and its transmission line, expected to bring enough solar energy to power 145,000 homes.Obama criticized fossil fuel companies lobbying against renewable energy, arguing they claimed to be for the free market \"until it's solar that people are buying and suddenly you're not for it anymore.\"Congressional Republicans are likely to balk at the White House's latest effort to promote renewable energy, although the regulations do not require lawmakers' approval.Earlier this month Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents the coal-producing state of Kentucky, blasted the administration's plan to cut carbon emissions, saying it would shutter power plants and drive up electricity costs.(Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker)Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "This Dog's Reenactments Of Classic Movies Will Make Your Tail Wag", "text": "Mondays get a bad rap.

Unfortunately, some of those uses in Times Square have come to include aggressive Elmos and painted semi-nude women. Recently, Police Commissioner Bratton suggested that the Square should be re-opened to traffic or, as he said, \"just dig the whole damn thing up!\" Mayor de Blasio then agreed that bringing cars back might be a good idea, and appointed a city task force to study the issue.It's a good idea to figure out a way to make Times Square's public space a more positive and family-friendly environment. It's a good idea to look at the design and make it a more attractive space. It's a bad idea to force pedestrians back into traffic as they were in the bad old days before Times Square banned motor vehicles. Commissioner Bratton is a great police commissioner but a lousy sustainability planner. I can't figure out what is happening to Mayor de Blasio; his Vision Zero traffic safety program is having a profound and positive impact on New Yorkers' driving habits and is improving pedestrian safety, but now he has suggested literally throwing pedestrians under the bus, truck and car in Times Square. Let's remember, the purpose of the Times Square Plaza was to provide pedestrian safety, speed north-south traffic, and create a new and attractive public space.Times Square is jammed with people. People pour out of hotels, theaters, chain restaurants and retail establishments night and day. The plaza absorbs some of that human traffic and provides space to sit and relax. On the nearby streets that permit motor vehicles, pedestrian traffic is heavy and difficult to navigate. Unless we want to give up on the economic powerhouse that we've created in Times Square, we need to cope with and learn to regulate our experiments with new forms of public space -- not give up on them.One of the most important goals in New York City's sustainability plan is to improve and increase the amount of the city's parklands. Turning the pedestrian plazas in Times Square into a city park would increase the city's ability to regulate behavior and make clear that the changes in land use are now permanent. The issue of free speech is far from trivial, but those issues remain if motor vehicles are present or are absent, and continue if the plaza is declared a park or retained as a pedestrian mall.Like many New Yorkers, I avoid Times Square when I can, but if you go to the theater or have business in midtown, it is hard to avoid. I try to stay away because it is crowded and moving around is difficult. In other parts of town, pedestrians are walking to get somewhere; in Times Square tourists are ambling, talking and gawking. However, it was more difficult to navigate before the plaza then it is today. The sheer volume of pedestrian traffic forced people to walk in the street. Bringing cars back would only increase congestion and increase danger.One of the goals of the Times Square plaza was to help address traffic gridlock. The issue was the impact of Broadway on the Manhattan street grid. North of 14th street in Manhattan, most of the island's streets are laid out in a north-south, east-west grid. Broadway, the city's original north-south thoroughfare, is different; it cuts a diagonal path from southeast to northwest. In Greenwich Village, Broadway is on the East Side; in Morningside Heights it is on the West Side. Each time Broadway crosses a major north-south street, it creates a traffic jam. We see that on the Upper West Side when Broadway crosses Columbus Avenue at 64th and 65th street and when it crosses Amsterdam Avenue at 71st street. By limiting Broadway's use as a north-south thoroughfare in midtown, the hope was that traffic would be diverted to other north-south streets that could better handle the load. Another hope when the Times Square plaza was created was that more people would use mass transit to get to Times Square.Even if the Plaza does not speed traffic, we still need beautiful and plentiful public spaces. The trade-off between regulating public behavior and free speech can be difficult, but must be taken on if we are to have public space in sustainable cities. Since we need more of these public spaces rather than fewer spaces, the behavior in Times Square is a challenge of governance that must be taken on by our mayor, city council, courts and police commissioner. The commissioner knows that even though demonstrations can be annoying and expensive to police, it is the job of his department to allow them and to keep them peaceful and safe. Additional and new forms of public space will be invented in the coming decades: parks like the High Line, plazas like Times Square, floating parks on the waterfront, rooftop parks, and who knows what else we might see? We can also expect new forms of mass behavior brought together by the internet. The NYPD has shown the ability to meet new challenges from terrorism to flash mobs. We need an effective strategy and set of rules for Times Square, not a retreat from public space because the people who use them can be obnoxious.It would be tragic to abandon rather than improve the public amenity that has been created in Times Square. Over the past decade, New York City has been gaining population and it is likely that within the next decade we will be a city of nine million people. That will be a more congested and less pleasant place unless we are able to improve mass transit and build new and more creative public spaces. In the competition for global business and population, a city needs to be safe and orderly, but dynamic and exciting as well. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, my father could drive us to mid-town Manhattan and park on the street. There were fewer people back then and many fewer cars, but that is the city of the past and unless catastrophe strikes, it is not coming back. Let's not turn back the clock. The Times Square plaza is part of the city of the future.It is good that Mayor de Blasio has formed a task force to deal with the behavioral, free speech and design issues generated by the Times Square plaza. However, the option of re-opening the plaza to vehicular traffic should be taken off the table. Moreover, the development of additional public spaces should become a higher priority in all five of the city's boroughs. Aggressive panhandling should be regulated and banned if possible, and performance art should be regulated and managed as well. Public space is a necessity--not a luxury--in the more densely settled sustainable cities of the 21st century. These parks should be safe and pleasant shared spaces that create a positive experience and impression. Many cities in the developing world lack these public spaces and the absence of such spaces places them at a competitive disadvantage. New York City has a large public park system that should be seen as a civic and economic asset worthy of care and greater investment.One part of that investment is ensuring the fact and perception of safety in New York's public spaces. New York City's police department is arguably the most capable police department in the world. It has learned how to police parades, demonstrations and all types of odd people and groups that are attracted to the \"city that never sleeps.\" The policing rarely requires force, but often requires strategy, information and technology. The NYPD's success at crowd control is obvious and well known. Moreover, the police force that has learned to deal with the ever-present threat of global terrorism can certainly handle Cookie Monster, the Joker and a little public nudity. We cannot afford to close or surrender public spaces because they are difficult to police."}, {"title": "10 Years After Katrina, Louisiana Is Becoming A Model For Climate Resilience", "text": "A decade after Hurricane Katrina devastated coastal Louisiana, forcing 1.5 million residents to evacuate and causing $100 billion in damage, the region is becoming a model for climate change adaptation planning -- even if some people in the state still don't want to say the \"c\" word.Louisiana's governor, long-shot Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal, has been non-committal on climate change. He'll acknowledge it's happening, but says he's uncertain how much humans are to blame. Nevertheless, Louisiana officials have been planning for rising temperatures and the cascading impacts climate change will have on the state, from rising seas to potentially more dangerous storms.\"We are leaders in climate change adaptation, we just don't call it that,\" said Doug Meffert, executive director of Audubon Louisiana.The Louisiana coast, with an average elevation of just three feet above sea level and a buffer of rapidly disappearing wetlands, is among the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change. But the state and the city of New Orleans have taken actions in the last 10 years to help make sure recovery from one disastrous storm leads to preparation for challenges the coast will face in the future.The Louisiana Audubon and a coalition of other environmental groups recently released a report looking at what's been done to make the region more sustainable, from rebuilding failed levees to developing a statewide plan for the coast, and where there still need to be investments.The failure of the levee system in and around New Orleans has been largely attributed to bad design and inadequate construction, which allowed water to flood 80 percent of the city in the aftermath of the storm.Improving the levees was a top priority, and New Orleans today boasts what has been called the \"best flood control system of any coastal community.\" Congress authorized more than $14 billion for rebuilding the levees and other flood protections after Katrina, leading to the construction of a 133-mile feat of civil engineering.Those investments have now protected the city against a 100-year flood -- a term used to describe a flood whose severity has only a 1 percent chance of happening in any one year. Building to that level of protection has been celebrated as a major post-Katrina accomplishment. But some point out that the system was supposed to be built to at least those specifications before the storm. After Katrina -- a 150-year storm for New Orleans and a 400-year storm for other parts of the Gulf Coast -- many say the protections should be even stronger.\"Most folks feel like a major city like New Orleans, a major urban center with economic resources, probably should have 400- or 500- standard of protection,\" said John Lopez, a scientist and the coastal sustainability program director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation.Still, Lopez said, the levee system has \"definitely improved since before Katrina.\"Before the storm, coastal protection from storms and restoration efforts were handled by separate agencies, with some work falling under the Department of Transportation and other work to the Department of Natural Resources. The state legislature moved in December 2005 to unify coastal issues under the new Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, or CPRA.CPRA is required to submit a plan for ecosystem restoration and hurricane protection to the state legislature each year. The plan is supposed to include CPRA's projects, as well as federal, parish and private restoration work.The most important part of that unified response under CPRA has been the creation of a state coastal master plan. The plan, to be updated every five years, is meant to outline the state's approach to \"achieving a sustainable coast through the integration of coastal protection and restoration projects and programs based on the best science and engineering available.\"The first master plan was finished in 2007. Meffert described it \"as a learning model.\"But the most recent master plan, released in 2012, is a \"masterpiece,\" Meffert said, based on sound science for what the region can expect as the climate changes and seas rise. \"It did what no other master plan or general plan had done before -- drew a map of Louisiana with projects that were impactful and doable, and it really for the first time put on the map what we could save,\" he said.The plan includes restoration, structural improvements, and \"nonstructural\" measures -- actions that acknowledge some flooding is likely to happen and that other steps, like raising houses above the flood plain and creating evacuation plans, are also necessary. The 2012 plan includes 109 projects along the coast, and would require $50 billion in investments over 50 years.The state is currently at work on its 2017 master plan.A major part of the master plan involves protecting and restoring coastal wetlands, which provide a natural barrier to storms. \"We need levees to protect urban centers, but we need our wetlands to protect our levees,\" said LopezLouisiana has 3 million acres of wetlands, but it's losing them at an astonishing rate -- a football field-size area every hour, according to a 2011 U.S. Geological Survey study.The coast is besieged by subsiding land and rising sea levels due to climate change. According to some projections, the Louisiana coast is seeing the highest rate of relative sea level rise in the world.The outlook for the wetlands is bleak. But hope has come in an unlikely place: the massive settlement resulting from the 2010 BP disaster, which spilled more than 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, the Department of Justice announced an $18.7 billion settlement with BP for damages resulting from the spill. Up to $8.7 billion of that could go to Louisiana's coastal restoration efforts. That gives the state a major investment toward the restoration work in the 2012 master plan.The state, \"appears to be putting every cent they can get from BP into funding those restoration protections,\" said Cynthia Sarthou, executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network. \"Sadly, the way we found some of that money was BP.\"While the BP settlement is \"a big step,\" said Lopez, it's not enough money fund all the elements of the state's master plan.The state has created a public website showing coastal risks and protection projects, launched earlier this year. Housed on Coastal.La.gov, the website for the CPRA, it includes interactive mapping that allows residents to pull up their own address and see both the flood projections and the efforts to reduce risks.The site is helping improve awareness about coastal vulnerabilities, as well as solutions.\"It gives people more of a reality check,\" said Simone Maloz, executive director of the group Restore or Retreat. \"Unfortunately in Louisiana, that's important.\"While the state's various projects are helping make the coastal region more resilient, there is growing recognition they won't always be enough.\"Restoration is not always an option, and neither is protection,\" said Maloz.This work includes raising individual houses out of the flood plain and educating the public about storm safety and response -- work that often falls to parish governments. Maloz said results have been mixed.One bright spot she points to is Terrebonne Parish, which has won funding through Federal Emergency Management Agency grants and state programs to raise more than 1,000 homes. That parish has a waiting list of people who want to elevate their houses.\"They have been able to cobble together all kinds of resources,\" said Maloz. But the challenge, she said, is that \"One parish might be getting it done, doing it right, and neighboring parish might not be even close.\"To really protect residents of the coast, more attention should be given to these measures, said Sarthou.\"Restoration may take 10 to 20 years,\" she said. \"Storms can happen any year. There needs to be more of an attempt to help those parishes prepare or mitigate damage or flood losses in those communities as we await the results of coastal restoration.\"New Orleans has a new point person for handling some of those human challenges: Jeff Hebert. He was appointed chief resilience officer in November. Hebert, who also serves as the executive director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, comes from a background in neighborhood revitalization.\"A lot of work has been done over 10 years, but much has been done in isolation from one another,\" said Hebert.Hebert's resilience officer position was created through a program of the Rockefeller Foundation called 100 Resilient Cities, which aims to unify resilience work within cities and unite municipalities around the world to solve problems collaboratively.Hebert said he sees his job as addressing three challenges: First, preparing for climate change, which includes homes, businesses and infrastructure, like water management systems. Second, working to connect city residents with job opportunities, particularly in climate-preparation work like coastal restoration and green infrastructure. Third, working to make it possible for people to stay in New Orleans, including financial literacy, access to health care and affordable housing.Climate change is a large part of that work, Hebert said. \"Resilience\" requires a better understanding of what climate change, sea level rise and changing storm patterns will mean for the city, and beginning to prepare for that. \"We're starting to understand that the future is going to look very different for us,\" he said.Hebert's office plans to release a new strategy on Aug. 25 that will lay out a vision for the city.\"We've been recovering for 10 years,\" said Hebert. \"Today is the time to pivot from recovery to building the future city.\"While many are using the 10-year anniversary of Katrina to reflect on what has been done, it's also an important point for reflecting on what still needs to happen.\"We can't confuse recovery with sustainability,\" said Lopez. \"Recovery gives you the opportunity to be more sustainable, but recovery is not sustainable in and of itself. It gives you the opportunity to take the next step.\""}, {"title": "Here's Why It Matters That China’s Been Emitting Less Carbon Than We Thought -- And Also Why It Doesn't", "text": "A team of Harvard researchers recently found, based on new analysis, that China is putting out roughly 14 percent less carbon than previous estimates suggest.The discrepancy comes from a consideration of not just the amount, but the type of coal China burns. The researchers found that China burns a lot of low-quality coal, which emits less CO2. The study marks the first time that coal quality is considered in calculating emissions. In the paper, published in Nature, authors Zhu Liu, Dabo Guan and others explain their methodology:We adopt the ‘apparent-consumption’ approach, which does not depend upon energy consumption data (that previous studies have shown to be not very reliable). Instead, apparent energy consumption is calculated from a mass balance of domestic fuel production, international trade, international fueling, and changes in stocks, data about which are less subject to ‘adjustment’ by reporting bodies and accounting errors… furthermore, this approach allows imported and domestically produced fuels to be tracked separately so that appropriate emission factors can be applied to these fuels.By teasing out the different production components and evaluating local coal from China’s largest coal-mining regions, the authors learned that earlier estimates overstated China’s carbon output by 2.9 billion tons, or around 14 percent, from 2000 to 2013. The revision could change global emissions estimates, which are already tough to measure, by around five percent, Liu said in an email.In some ways, that difference doesn’t really matter. Nature points out that the lower estimates don’t alter China’s position as the world’s greatest carbon polluter, by far. In a phone interview with Fusion, Guan emphasized that the findings shouldn’t take China off the hook.“Really,” he explained, “our scientific contribution is trying to provide a more accurate estimate for Chinese emission trends. A more robust, more accurate baseline for climate science, from the policy perspective.”Guan adds that he hopes his study will make China a precedent-setter in terms of accuracy in tracking emissions. But others think Guan’s findings may not be the final world on Chinese emissions. Nature reports:Scientists are still waiting for the government to release revised estimates of energy production, including imports and exports, over the past decade. Liu says that his team’s estimates are unlikely to change when the latest data are released later this year, but [climate policy researcher Glen] Peters says that the figures may need to rise by as much as 7 percent.Tracking carbon emissions is key to keeping tabs on the Earth’s carbon intake -- which in turns affects our understanding of climate change. Nature explains that as the emissions output change, scientists’ understanding of the carbon cycle falls apart. If China is emitting less carbon than we thought, that means carbon intake models -- which look at how much carbon is being absorbed by oceans and forests -- are wrong. From Nature:For comparison, the cumulative reduction in Chinese emissions outlined in the study — roughly 2.9 billion tonnes from 2000 to 2013 — is larger than the estimated amount of carbon that the world’s forests pulled out of the atmosphere from 1990 to 2007. That presents a problem for researchers who study the carbon cycle. “We can easily go back and retroactively adjust Chinese carbon-emission estimates,” says Ashley Ballantyne, a climate scientist at the University of Montana in Missoula. “Unfortunately, we cannot go back and adjust all the previous studies on the global carbon cycle and their conclusions based on the previously biased emission estimates.\"Andy Jacobson, CarbonTracker project lead research at University of Colorado Boulder and NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, told Fusion in an email that the emissions revision will affect carbon intake modeling. “It will have a ripple effect, causing a revision in our estimates of carbon sinks on land and in the ocean,” he said. Carbon sinks are areas that absorb more carbon than they emit, like oceans and forests. Jacobson continued:We rely very heavily on self-reported economic activity accounts like those being scrutinized in this study, in large part because there aren’t enough direct observations of atmospheric composition to unambiguously quantify a given country’s emissions.Jacobson explained that people who track carbon use historical data to figure out how the Earth reacts to carbon pollution.“Our historical analysis of atmospheric CO2 provides an important observational constraint on how terrestrial and marine ecosystems have reacted to elevated CO2, ocean warming and acidification, drought, and other weather anomalies,” Jacobson said. “This constraint is used to develop and tune carbon cycle models used in climate predictions.”So, he says, revisions affect climate change predictions, indirectly. “Will the oceans and land continue to remove half of our fossil fuel emissions from the atmosphere, or are these sinks going to saturate?”We do know for certain that China’s burning less coal in 2015 than in recent years.

I recently had a conversation with some friends about Arianna's new book, Thrive, and the zeitgeist of today. I do agree that Western societies are at an inflection point -- that we are experiencing a collective wake-up call about the deeper meaning of our lives and social purpose of our organizations outside of material success.A few nights ago, my friend Julien and I had an extraordinary experience that aligns with these conversations that we wanted to share. We came upon a distressing scene on the cascading street steps in front of our little rental house in Mykonos: A woman was weeping and crying out in Italian next to a grey-white stray cat that was sprawled out in a pool of blood struggling to live.More than a dozen people emerged speaking a cacophony of languages grasping for ways to save the cat. So, we focused on finding a Greek person from the island who could help.Just at that moment, a friendly merchant appeared. He explained it was the day of the Ascension and no clinic would be open. But the assembly of neighbors would not yield. After exhausting almost all the options, the merchant called and found one vet willing to open his clinic.With a local waitress on a motorcycle to guide our jeep, we raced the cat -- that the assembly had bundled in a box -- to the clinic. We meditated and soothed him, encouraging the cat to stay with us. He shot back innocent sparkles from his eyes.When we arrived, Kostas, the vet, was waiting in his clinic beaming light from atop a hill overlooking the town. Kostas found in the little cat a deep stab wound from a knife still gushing blood. (We have since learned there are adolescent boys who taunt cats in the neighborhood.) With no staff at hand, I assisted the operation for one hour as we stitched the inner muscle and then the pelt of the cat.The cat survived and we were thrilled. We tucked him into bed at 10 p.m. only to learn the following morning that he may not be able to walk. Julien has named the cat Odysseus, and we are hoping to learn in a few days that he can continue to survive the voyage.In light of some of the reflections we had been sharing together with some friends a week before this incident, I have been pondering the meaning of it all.One message is clear: The endgame of cruelty need not prevail; collective human compassion and intelligence can overcome it. Still, it takes an outpouring of kindness to overcome one act of cruelty and it takes believing that the first can trump the second.No matter the trauma that Odysseus endured, he never exhibited fear of the assembly of neighbors. Just the opposite -- he seemed to believe that it was the first that can prevail in humans."}, {"title": "Giving a Voice to the Silencing of the Lambs", "text": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) recently released an appalling video of lambs being skinned alive by an Ovis 21 network farm in Argentina.

This suggests that dogs can read human social situations, an ability known as \"social eavesdropping.\" [Like Dog, Like Owner: What Breeds Say About Personality]However, not everyone is on board with the study's conclusions.\"So far, it is not clear what dogs understand about human interactions,\" said Marie Nitzschner, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, who was not involved in the study. \"More research is needed.\"Social eavesdroppingAs many dog owners know, the animals eagerly watch people all the time, said the study's senior author, Kazuo Fujita, a professor of psychology and comparative cognition at Kyoto University in Japan.But it's not clear whether dogs watch people for the animals' own immediate benefit (such as for a signal that they're getting a treat) or simply to figure out what's happening.If dogs, or any animals, are able to socially eavesdrop on people, it could help the animals assess people from afar.\"The ability to glean information from a social exchange without having to participate in it themselves would be very useful,\" said Shannon Kundey, an associate professor of psychology at Hood College in Maryland, who was not involved with the study. \"They would be able to gain a lot of information while putting themselves at minimal risk.\"Scientists have assessed social eavesdropping in a menagerie of animals, including chimpanzees, tufted capuchin monkeys, common marmosets, domestic dogs and cleaner fish, in which the animals watched human actors interact. But many of these studies involved food.\"[This] raises the possibility that [animal] participants simply preferred actors who were more likely to give them a better chance of getting food,\" instead of figuring out the human interaction, the researchers said in the study.For instance, \"Typically, one actor generously gives food to a human beggar, and the other refuses to do so,\" Fujita told Live Science in an email. \"And the dogs tended to go to the generous actor. No wonder. Dogs may naturally do so with the expectation that 'this person is more likely to give me food.'\"Doggy deliberationTo avoid the complication of food in the new experiment, the researchers created a social interaction using a junk object (a roll of vinyl tape in a container). In all, 54 dogs and their owners completed the test.In the experiment, the dog watched its owner unsuccessfully try to open a container holding tape. The owner requested the help of an actor sitting nearby. In one condition, the actor helped the owner by supporting the container, allowing the owner to open it and retrieve the tape. In another condition, the actor refused to help, by turning away.After these interaction sequences, the actor and a neutral bystander simultaneously offered treats to the dog. The researchers noted which person the dog preferred.When the actor helped the owner, the dogs did not have a preference, meaning they chose treats at an equal rate from both the actor and the bystander. But when the actor snubbed the owner, the dogs tended to avoid the actor and take treats more often from the bystander instead. [5 Animals with a Moral Compass]\"[The] dogs avoided people who behaved negatively to the owner,\" Fujita said.It's perplexing that the dogs didn't prefer the helpful actor over the bystander in the first condition, but perhaps helping is a \"standard\" that dogs have, meaning it's possibly status quo and nothing special, Fujita said.\"Dogs may have hated a violator of this standard,\" he said. \"Similar negativity bias has been reported in human infants.\"Lessons learnedThe new study supports the idea that dogs can socially eavesdrop on people, Fujita said.The \"dogs made a social evaluation in a situation irrelevant to their immediate benefit,\" he said.However, the study has several limitations, experts said. The dog owners did not know the purpose of the experiment, but they may have conveyed cues to the dogs that they didn't like the actor who snubbed them, Kundey said.\"Even if the owner did not know the purpose of the experiment or the hypotheses that the authors were testing, it would be important to ensure that they did not guess the hypotheses and that they did not inadvertently cue the dogs,\" she told Live Science.It's also unclear whether the actor and the bystander changed positions, or whether one was always on the right-hand side of the owner, and the other on the left. For instance, a dog might choose a side, rather than a person.\"For example, I would doubt that the dogs would still choose the neutral person in the nonhelper condition, if neutral person and nonhelper would change their positions after the interactions and before the dogs chose (at least, this is what I found in one of my studies),\" Nitzschner wrote in an email.In fact, the vinyl-tape interaction is \"quite complex, and I'm not sure if the dogs really understand what is going on there,\" Nitzschner added. If the dogs truly understood the interaction, more of them should have taken the treat from the helper in the helping situation, she said.Dogs may be experts in reading people — including an owner's gestures, facial expressions and maybe even emotions — but it's unclear how much the animals understand about human interactions.\"The literature on this revealed mixed results,\" Nitzschner said. \"That's why we need more research on this.\"The study was published in the August issue of the journal Animal Behavior.Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel.

Back in 2013, Google purchased a company called Makani, the creators of one of the cooler alternative energy devices you'll ever see: the Energy Kite. Part wind turbine, part model airplane, the Energy Kite flies way up high in huge circles as it captures steady winds to send power back down to the ground. It's lightweight, portable, and easily deployable.The kite uses 90 percent less material than a typical wind turbine and yet can generate 50 percent more power -- perhaps 600 kilowatts -- according to the company. How? By flying much higher -- up to 350 meters -- than any wind turbine could ever hope to reach and by being extremely efficient. It's as if only the tip of a wind turbine blade was looping around in the sky. The rest of the turbine -- all those tons of steel -- simply disappears from the equation.The kite is launched from its ground station using its rotors for lift, but once it begins to soar on the wind, those rotors become mini wind turbines and drive generators that produce electricity. The juice is then sent back down the wire. And unlike your childhood kite, this kite knows where it's going. Its flight path is guided by a computer that uses a GPS and sensors to constantly recalculate the best path for optimum efficiency. As for maintenance, well you certainly don't need a crane or helicopter -- you just reel it back down to the ground.At the SXSW conference in March, Google X head Astro Teller said that testing would begin on an 84-foot kite in Pesacadero, California later this year.Perhaps the biggest advantage of the Energy Kite is that, according to Makani, in the continental United States alone, the kite can generate wind power economically in over 66 percent of the landmass, more than four times the area available to conventional wind turbines. However, and it's a very big however, Federal Aviation Administration rules may make deployment extremely difficult on land, demanding such things as 5,000 feet of clearance from any trunk power line or public road. You can understand the concern. It's disconcerting to imagine a nearly invisible electrified line sweeping across the landscape at an incredible rate of speed. Another concern is noise: it isn't exactly silent. It could turn out, then, that best place for the Energy Kite is offshore, perhaps off the shores of Hawaii.

It's one of North America's fastest growing markets for clean energy, \"bringing jobs, bringing revenues, and increasing every year, outpacing other industries and regions,\" Robin Aldina, Manager of Energy Research for the NC Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), told the ECOreport. \"The number of jobs has grown every year since 2008, and there is no indication in our thriving economic climate that this growth is going to stop.\"In fact, according to the 2014 North Carolina Clean Energy Industry Census, the state's cleantech sector grossed nearly $5 billion in 2014, and is expected to grow between 30 and 35 percent this year. There are 1,208 cleantech firms in the state employing the equivalent of 22,995 full-time workers and generating $4.8 billion of direct and indirect economic activity.What are they working on? Mainly the efficiency of buildings. That sector produces about 40 percent of the state's clean energy revenues, with 833 companies focusing on it through construction, consulting, or the installation of systems and components. The next-largest sector is solar, with 450 companies involved. North Carolina is ranked fourth nationwide in installed solar power, with more than 600 megawatts (MW) of capacity.Things are going so well that the state has actually become an exporter. Up to 20 percent of its cleantech goods and services head out of state.By the way, does your state do a cleantech census? Maybe it should.One reason North Carolina has been so productive in the green arena is that the state has had a renewable energy investment tax credit of up to 35 percent in place for several years, and it's on the books at least through the end of 2015. Another state, Illinois, is heading down the same path with a bill sponsored by State Senator Don Harmon (D-Oak Park) and State Representative Elaine Nekritz (D-Northbrook) that would update Illinois' Renewable Portfolio Standard in ways that they hope could create 32,000 clean energy jobsThe bill is designed to expand solar power and improve energy efficiency, in part by increasing the state's renewable energy standard from 25 percent by 2025 to 35 percent by 2030, a move which, as you might imagine, does have its opponents, especially from the coal lobby.

The study, by researchers at the University of Victoria in Canada, points to the huge impact that human society has had on food webs and ecosystems around the globe and dubs our species an unsustainable \"super predator.\"For evidence, the team only had to look to the oceans, where humans remove fish at 14 times the rate of marine predators. Humans, the study points out, are \"particularly intense\" when it comes to hunting, and have used powerful killing technology (trawl nets, guns and mechanized slaughterhouses, for example) to dominate other predators.\"Hunters 'capture' mammals with bullets, and fishes with hooks and nets,\" author Chris Darimont told reporters, according to the BBC. \"They assume minimal risk compared with non-human predators, especially terrestrial carnivores, which are often injured while living what amounts to a dangerous lifestyle.\"The research echoes what many scientists have warned for years: If we don't stop overfishing, we may soon run out of animals to catch. Many fish populations have been hunted to the brink of collapse, shark populations have been decimated and less than 8 percent of southern bluefin tuna remain.The report also notes that it's not just the sheer number of animals that humans kill for food -- some estimates say 56 billion farmed animals are slaughtered annually -- it's the type of animals we take. Humans focus on adult prey, unlike other predators. A full-grown lion, for example, often opts for the smaller, weaker juvenile zebra rather than an adult.This distinction makes it harder for animal populations to recover as breeding members are removed. \"We are dialing back the reproductive capacity of populations,\" Darimont said.The paper suggests altering the food we choose to hunt, to focus on smaller, younger prey. But humans are far too good at using more of the planet's resources than we should.We've already consumed this year's worth of the world's resources, and it's only August."}, {"title": "Hurricane Danny Strengthens Into Category 3 Storm", "text": "Hurricane Danny strengthened to a potentially destructive Category 3 storm on Friday, though it had likely reached its peak intensity and remained relatively small and far from land, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.Winds from Danny, the first hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic season, measured up to 115 miles per hour (185 kph), government forecasters said.Danny is expected to weaken back into a tropical storm as it reaches the outer Caribbean islands early next week, before heading towards Puerto Rico and the island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to the Miami-based hurricane center's five-day outlook.\"Danny remains a very small tropical cyclone,\" the center said on Friday, after it had been upgraded to a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane wind intensity.The center said hurricane-force winds extended only 15 miles (24 km) from the center of the storm.Danny was about to encounter a less conducive environment of upper winds, and was forecast to weaken over the next 48 hours, the center said in its latest advisory on Friday afternoon.Danny is the fourth named storm of what forecasters have predicted will be a quieter-than-normal 2015 hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.The Saffir-Simpson scale measures potential property damage from a storm, with hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher considered \"major\" hurricanes with a potential for significant loss of life and damage.A Category 3 storm has winds of between 111 and 129 mph (178-208 kph).The government's seasonal forecast predicted six to 10 named storms this year, with as many as four reaching hurricane status of 74 mph (119 kph), and at most one reaching the major category.Still, forecasters warn that quieter-than-average years in the past have seen some of the most destructive storms in history, such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds above 157 mph (252 kph) that devastated south Florida.Among the factors in this year's predicted weaker hurricane season is the El Niño weather phenomenon, the warming of Pacific waters that affects wind circulation patterns and makes the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic-Caribbean basin less likely.The Climate Prediction Center, a National Weather Service agency, last week raised the likelihood to 85 percent that El Niño conditions would last into early spring in the Northern Hemisphere.(Additional reporting by Letitia Stein in Tampa, Fla.; Editing by Phil Berlowitz, Bernadette Baum, Toni Reinhold)"}, {"title": "7 Under-The-Radar Destinations That Will Reignite Your Sense Of Wonder", "text": "Set aside time for awesome experiences and ultimately, studies show, it could help you live a happier life.Gazing up at a powerful waterfall, losing yourself in the majesty of a sunset, and feeling the icy magnitude of a glacier all have the ability to make us feel small and more generous toward others.

Lion populations are in free fall, and we are losing this iconic species in most of its range. Only two centuries ago, hundreds of thousands of lions inhabited Africa. Today there are perhaps 20,000 of the big cats, living in 8 percent of their former range.Trophy hunting is legal in Zimbabwe -- although Cecil's killing was a particularly repugnant case, in which many laws were apparently broken. Infuriating as trophy hunting may be, it is just one issue. Dozens of lions are killed each week by rural Africans in defense of their domestic cattle, goats, and camels. Many more cats die in wire snares and iron traps. Mostly laid to catch herbivores for the massive trade in wild bushmeat, illegal traps are a twofold blow for lions. Poaching devastates the wild prey that sustains lion populations. And drawn in by the distress calls of dying ungulates, lions are then captured in nearby snares themselves, where they die prolonged, ghastly deaths. As wildebeest, zebras, and antelope decline from poaching, lions resort to killing livestock, further fueling retaliatory killing by herders and ranchers.Cecil at Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. Photo by Paul Funston/PantheraThere is a way to break this relentless cycle. We at Panthera, a big-cat conservation organization, hire locals to protect both livestock and lions. Their first job is to find lions. They do so either by the traditional method of following fresh tracks, or we train them to be para-biologists, skilled in the use of technologies like radio collars and camera traps, motion-triggered cameras that photograph lions and other wildlife as they pass by. Our lion guards keep tabs on big cats so they can chase them away from villages and communities or direct herders to graze their stock elsewhere. We also equip lion guards with training, tools, and funding to reinforce the corrals where livestock is kept overnight, when lions do most of their hunting. The lion guards provide free labor to community members, either improving traditional bomas made with local acacia thorn trees or building entirely new corrals fortified with chain-link fencing and sturdy poles. The new corrals work particularly well to protect large herds where the traditional acacia model is hard-pressed to contain 200 or 300 head of panicked cattle.Addressing the underlying reasons that compel pastoralists to hate lions dramatically reduces their inclination to resort to bullets or poison. We went from 20 dead lions in 2013 to only one last year when we launched the program in a particularly bad conflict hot spot in northern Namibia. In communities adjacent to Zimbabwe's magnificent Hwange National Park, where Cecil lived, only nine lion guards working with Panthera's partners, Oxford University's Hwange Lion Project, managed to reduce the number of killed cattle from 260 in 2010 to 73 by 2014. Living lions are the reason that we employ people -- no lions, no jobs -- giving people in local communities further incentive to tolerate big cats.Dr. Luke Hunter, Mustapha Nsubuga, and Joel Ziwa fit a radio collar on a lioness at Kigezi Wildlife Reserve in Uganda. Photo by A. Plumptre/WCSTackling the issue of poaching is a more formidable challenge. Lion guards help by removing snares and discouraging people from setting them at all, but that is a stopgap. Many of Africa's vast national parks and game reserves are desperately under-resourced--which is part of the reason their governments resort to trophy hunting to generate much-needed revenue for anti-poaching patrols. The solution is clear: more park guards, equipment, and training. Panthera and similar organizations are providing these things, but Africa's protected areas are colossal, some the size of small countries, so protection is expensive and daunting. It will take a global response -- the kind of worldwide reaction we have seen to the death of Cecil -- to summon the funding and political action required to curtail poaching. If we fail, top carnivores such as the lion will be the first species to vanish but not the last. Just as with overhunted tropical forests around the world, there are already large tracts of African savanna emptied of wildlife by human hunters.Cecil would still be alive if trophy hunting had been outlawed, and perhaps this will now happen, if the global outrage over his death is any indication. However, Cecil's species will continue to disappear unless the world supports Africa's governments with the tremendous resources they need to secure the huge, iconic landscapes that still have lions, and the continent's rural, livestock-owning communities in their daily efforts to live among these great cats.---Luke Hunter is the president of Panthera.

However, bulk donation programs wreck the market and the customer's perception of solar as a concept.Solar products need to be deployed and serviced with the highest quality of customer satisfaction in mind. Mainstream bulk donation programs often do not budget for high quality products or invest in the distribution and after-sales service required for solar, leaving customers with either inferior products or, over time, faulty products that stop working and spoil the market concept of solar in general.In their recent June 2015 Opinion Brief, the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association highlights the issue:\"Systematic reductions on retail prices, and especially free give-aways, signal to consumers that they do not need to pay full retail price -- or pay at all -- for these goods, and consumers will accordingly hold out for reduced-cost or free goods in the future, regardless of whether they will ever come. While there may be a short term benefit for selected users, these reductions or give-aways will result in such adoption being less likely to be sustained and broader adoption of solar off-grid lighting being significantly hampered.\"The tainted history of donating solar products to households is long and well-known by the industry, which makes SkyPower's initiative puzzling and to some down-right upsetting. From political campaigns, charities and corporate CSR, donating solar products to households has been done decades over with similar results - A flashy article and photo op for the organization, smiling faces of recipients, and the feel-good effect of thinking something good has been accomplished. It's understandable to want to help when heart strings are pulled at the sight of energy poverty. However the reality of donating solar to the masses is a dark one because of the long term down side such \"dump and run\" efforts produce.Distributed energy solutions such as solar home kits are the cheapest, fastest and safest solution to take a family out of poverty overnight, if deployed using market principles of quality and service. They support increased income-generating hours, better and longer home and study conditions for women and children, and overall upward mobility. Ironically, donating solar to a family seems like a worthy endeavor, but without the right infrastructure and investments to support it typically leaves families with very poor experiences which is arguably worse than doing nothing at all. Losing new energy customer by giving free, inferior products and / or poor infrastructure to support them results in a U-turn in energy access development, not to mention it distorts the market conditions and disrupts the growth of record investments being deployed into the industry.US President Barack Obama's Power Africa concurs and backs a strong market-based environment for energy access to thrive: \"Power Africa supports bringing increased electricity access to Kenya through a market-based approach. Kenya is the center of innovation in off-grid solar and is the home to trusted companies -- many of which are Power Africa partners-- who offer high-quality products with strong warranties and service guarantees.\"SkyPower has big, bold plans for Africa and beyond and there's no doubt we need SkyPower's valuable contribution to deploy clean energy for the world. With a revised plan, many beyond-the-grid companies and organizations might like to partner with SkyPower to support their objectives for energy access, however, alternatives in the case of solar kit donations into Kenya would have to be considered. Several attempts were made for on-record comments from Kerry Adler, SkyPower's CEO for this article to better understand SkyPower's plans and discuss constructive alternatives, however, Mr. Adler did not show up for schedules calls. In light of the missed opportunity, SkyPower and Mr. Adler may consider the following:SolarCity's GivePower program offers a best-in-class example for when it's appropriate to donate IFC Lighting approved solar systems, such as to schools and health clinics backed with on the ground service operators.Alternatively, natural disaster relief programs such as the deployment into Nepal this past spring demonstrate an effective use of the donation platform with certified quality products.On the commercial side, SkyPower might consider setting up a working capital fund using the budget allocated to procure product for donation, and instead support beyond-the-grid companies already working in Kenya through deployment of working capital to fuel their efforts.IFC Lighting Global echoes these recommendations:\"Lighting Africa welcomes the participation of companies in the off-grid energy space. Free products can assist people that may not otherwise purchase a solar product, but, if not managed well, they can harm the entire supply chain and the market. Given that consumers spend between $90 - $120 per year on kerosene for lighting, Lighting Africa believes that making solar products more affordable will have the greatest impact on accelerating energy access. We recommend setting up financing facilities with local banks and MFIs to support further sales of solar products with a focus on sustainable positive impact.\"As a veteran energy access entrepreneur I have seen first-hand the market destruction of bulk donation programs. I have no doubt SkyPower has good intentions behind their plans, yet the Canadian company may wish to think twice before letting loose a wayward bull in Kenya's fast growing energy access market that could wreck the market for decades to come."}, {"title": "Parrot Detained By Police For Shouting Obscenities", "text": "It sounds bird-brained, but officers in the Indian city of Rajura detained a parrot for allegedly cursing at an 85-year-old woman.The parrot's name is \"Hariyal,\" and he was reportedly trained for two years in the finer points of obscenity by his owner, Suresh Sakharkar for the sole purpose of abusing his 85-year-old stepmother, Janabai.\"On seeing me, the parrot uses bad language and foul words.

Republican candidates continue to use stock phrases like \"I'm not a scientist,\" but at least they are talking about climate change.We've come a long way.When I started working at the NRDC Action Fund in 2004, climate change barely registered on the political landscape. I was coming off of Capitol Hill and most of my time was spent on parks and water issues, which we were just starting to think of in terms of climate change. Most voters were concerned about the war in Iraq, No Child Left Behind, and the latest episode of Desperate Housewives--it was before streaming, after all. Global warming, as we called it then, was the focus of policy wonks and researchers and few others.Then something shifted: climate change started hitting home in painful and costly ways. Nine out of the 10 hottest years ever occurred since 2002. We witnessed the destructive power of storms like Katrina and Sandy and became accustomed to using the words \"record-breaking\" when we talk about everything from snowfalls to wildfires. People's lives were turned upside down by climate impacts, and Americans began calling on leaders to do something about it.Now that I have decided to leave the NRDC Action Fund to return to my roots to head up the Ohio Environmental Council and its Action Fund, I can't help but reflect on the progress made by my amazing NRDC colleagues and the larger environmental movement.Not only have we helped secure policies to limit carbon pollution from power plants and cut climate change pollution from new cars in half by 2025--saving drivers $80 billion a year at the pump, but we have also helped put climate change on the campaign map. Candidates hoping to win the White House, the governor's mansion, or a Congressional seat in 2016 must discuss the climate threat.It's been an honor to be a small part of this transformation. It's also been an incredible learning experience. It turns out, for instance, that PowerPoint Presentations can win Oscars, but voters still don't want to hear about carbon wedges. And Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) can throw all the snowballs he wants on the Senate floor, but he can't fool the majority of Americans into denying climate change.Local Climate Stories Move Voters: When Gary Peters ran for Senate from Michigan, he didn't talk about worldwide CO2 emissions or sea-level rise. He described how climate change was hurting the Great Lakes and other beloved people and places in Michigan. And he celebrated the 80,000 green goods and services jobs in the state. He also took on the Koch brothers, who were responsible for polluting waterways in the state and funding the opposition. He won, and he confirmed the power of connecting the dots between global climate change, the fossil fuel cronies, and voters' daily lives.Running Clean Works: NRDC Action Fund research has confirmed that candidates who campaign on clean energy and climate action from the beginning win--including Senators Jon Tester (D-MT) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in 2012 to Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) in 2014. Clean energy provides a positive, solutions-based narrative to talk about issues that matter most to Americans: jobs, the economy, and the health of their families.Big Money Is Here to Stay: Political time can be measured in two epochs: before the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling spilled millions of unregulated dollars into political campaigns, and after. It's a fact of life now that spending has reached staggering heights. Fossil fuel industry spent more than $721 million in the 2014 election cycle alone. But the last presidential election proved that even that much money can't buy you love. Despite the Koch brothers' best efforts, clean energy and climate champions won up and down the ticket.The Fight Is Spreading to the States in an even Bigger Way: Now that the Clean Power Plan has established limits on carbon pollution from power plants, each state can figure out how it will achieve its reductions. This is a huge opportunity to create new jobs and save people money on energy bills. But it is also a chance for naysayers to try to delay and interfere at the state level. That's one reason I am joining the Ohio Environmental Council: I want to help set the bar high for climate action and clean energy growth in the Midwest.Time to Paint Climate Stonewalling as Extremism: Republicans in Congress are trying to block the Clean Power Plan, and every GOP presidential candidate has decried it. Yet not a single one has offered a plan for tackling what is the biggest environmental and public health threat of our time. Poll after poll after poll confirms the vast majority of Americans want leaders to address climate change. It's time to point out the GOP's failure for what it is: out-of-step extremism.It Will be Tough for a Climate Denier to Win the White House: Extensive polling from red and blue and purple states reveals that climate change matters to the majority of voters. And it really matters to three voting blocs that will be key to winning in 2016: women, Latinos, and young people. Voters want a leader in the White House who will confront the big challenges, not ignore their existence.This Is a Marathon, Not a Sprint: Creating major political change requires stamina. The average bill becoming a law takes eight years to get passed, and most bills die well before that. A complex challenge like climate change will demand many bills, policies and technological innovations, but we will keep running until we cross the finish line. I do it because of my faith and because I want to leave the planet in better shape for my children. They deserve it. Our communities and beautiful wild places deserve it. And even our opponents deserve it.See you in Ohio."}, {"title": "Scientists Confirm That Some Spiders Can Pretty Much BASE Jump", "text": "Your worst nightmare has come true: Spiders are falling from the sky.Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Louisville and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute have found that some spiders in the tropical/subtropical genus Selenops leap from treetops and steer through the air to land on neighboring tree trunks -- much like a BASE jumper steering his or her way down a cliff.Selenops is the first genus of spider found to display this behavior, which is evidently does in order to find food and avoid predators. Some insects, like canopy ants, have also been observed doing this.For their research, the scientists collected 59 Selenops spiders from tree trunks in Peru and Panama. Then the researchers dropped the spiders one by one -- always from a height of between 65 and 80 feet, and always within about five feet of a nearby tree trunk -- and observed what happened.An overwhelming majority of these spiders -- 55 out of 59, or about 93 percent -- made what the researchers call a \"direct\" descent toward the tree trunk, meaning they glided toward the trunk in what appeared to be a controlled, deliberate manner and landed successfully on it.What's interesting, according to the findings, is that these spiders \"never attached draglines to the specimen vial during the initial drop, nor was silk ever seen during descent.\" In other words, the spiders were in free fall -- but could still control the direction of their descent, apparently by moving and twitching their legs in midair. (The researchers note that \"each spider was tested only once, as it was not possible to recover individuals post-descent\" -- which, yeah, if someone dropped us from 65 feet off the ground, we wouldn't stick around to let them do it a second time, either.)If it's any comfort, the researchers note that \"other arachnid lineages,\" like scorpions and daddy longlegs, do not exhibit the same controlled gliding behavior, meaning you don't have to worry about scorpions paratrooping through your window at night.The findings were published Wednesday at the Journal of the Royal Society Interface website."}, {"title": "EPA Methane Rule: A Good Start Toward Meeting Administration's Landmark Goal", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a big step this week, announcing the nation's first methane pollution standards for the oil and gas industry. But to understand the impact of these new draft rules, it's important to look at what they do - and what they don't - and measure them against the nation's bold but readily achievable goals set out by the Obama administration earlier this year.The president's target of reducing methane emissions by 40 to 45 percent in the next decade is historic - currently there are no national limits on methane pollution from the oil and gas industry. It's also critical to protecting the climate and public health - methane packs more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe, and is released along with other toxic pollutants.The scale of the problem is massive, with industry releasing more than 7 million tons of methane each year. It could also be even bigger than we realize. A new study published just this week reported unrecorded methane emissions from thousands of facilities in only one part of the supply chain. It concluded gathering facility emissions were eight times higher than estimated, a staggering figure that if included in EPA's inventory would increase current estimates of total industry emissions by 20 percent.So, how does the new proposal measure up? Here is our first take on some of the key elements:A down payment on the nation's goalEDF has always believed that a direct approach is the best approach. So it's great to see that EPA addressed methane head-on. But targeting existing sources of methane pollution will be critical to achieving the nation's reduction goal, and EPA's proposed rules deal largely with methane from new and modified sources, leaving 6.7 million metric tons on the table from infrastructure supporting the 1 million wells already in operation. Taken together, EPA projects these actions will reduce methane by 560 to 620 thousand short tons which, for context, represents about 7 to 8 percent of the total emissions from the oil and gas supply chain in the 2012 Inventory.While the EPA rules are just one of several actions that will help the nation cut methane pollution by 45 percent, they are one of the most important.Additional actions will be needed to meet this goal, including decisive action to tackle the biggest part of the problem--emissions from wells, pipelines, and facilities in operation now. Indeed, over the next few years, 90 percent of emissions will come from existing, not new sources.The proposed standards include a pathway for addressing existing sources in non-attainment areas, through control technique guidelines (CTGs) to get at volatile organic compounds, an ozone precursor. For many of the existing sources covered by CTGs, EPA leverages the same technologies and practices that the agency proposed to apply to new sources in the rest of its rules - demonstrating that we have the technologies to cost-effectively deal with new and existing emission sources. Indeed, states like Colorado and Wyoming have effectively applied standards to reduce oil and gas emissions from existing and new operations based on these technologies, and EPA should follow.Frequent Leak Monitoring is a Priority  We know that leaks are a big source of oil and gas methane emissions and that regular inspection and maintenance can go a long way toward reducing the emissions. It's a good thing that EPA's proposal included leak detection and repair, and that these requirements apply to both well sites and compressor stations across the natural gas supply chain. They also require operators to look for leaks at components and pieces of equipment (like storage tanks) that can be very significant sources of emissions.Frequent monitoring for leaks is critical to mitigating methane emissions, as leaks can emerge anywhere at any time and can be difficult to predict. EPA's proposal included provisions for semi-annual and annual monitoring, and in certain cases, also proposed to allow facilities to reduce the frequency of their monitoring requirements. States like Colorado and Wyoming have recognized that more frequent monitoring is necessary and highly-cost effective to stay on top of emissions. EPA has requested comment on this and it will be important for the final standards to reflect these states' leading practices.Liquids unloading sidelined, for now  Last fall, EPA issued a set of five technical white papers, analyzing the biggest sources of methane and cost-effective technologies capable of reducing those emissions. EPA's new standards address new and modified sources in four of these five categories--equipment leaks, pneumatic devices, compressors, and oil well completions. It took some good steps here, including extending green completions to oil wells, as leading states Colorado and Wyoming have already done. And, these requirements apply across segments--including production, gathering and boosting, processing, and transmission and storage.EPA took comment on, but did not propose to address, the fifth source--liquids unloading, a common maintenance practice operators use to purge liquids that accumulate during production. We know from scientific research that this is a big source of emissions, and states like Colorado have already taken action to address these and standards for liquids unloading will be an important feature of a rigorous final rule.Let's Get Going  The lion's share to the reductions needed can be achieved simply by transforming the best practices already demonstrated by companies in the industry into the standard practices used throughout the industry.Those who have first-hand experience successfully putting these practices to use didn't shy away from sharing their thoughts on the rule. Some of the more responsible companies in the field, who have already seen the benefits of methane reduction efforts, showed support for EPA's action, despite the typical outcry against regulation by many of the usual industry players.And from Colorado, which in 2014 became the first state to directly regulate methane emissions, Governor John Hickenlooper also put his support behind the rule, saying that \"protecting public health and the environment, and promoting our energy industry are not mutually exclusive endeavors.\"It's time to translate this success and support into action - working over the coming months to strengthen EPA's rules so we can put them into practice and start achieving the reductions we need to protect our health, environment and economy.This blog post is cross-posted with EDF's blog, Energy Exchange."}, {"title": "6 Ways Billion-Dollar Businesses Prove You Can Profit And Still Do Good", "text": "For all those doubters in business who believe it’s not possible to combine making money with creating a better world, it’s time to think again.There are now at least nine companies globally, five of them in the United States, which make more than $1 billion in annual revenues from products that have sustainability or social good at the heart of what they do.These are not companies that rely on a committed group of green shoppers to buy their products. Instead, they represent some of the most innovative multinationals on the planet, and their recipe for success can serve as a model for other companies looking to make a difference.Making the list are Tesla’s electric vehicles and Toyota’s Prius, as well as Nike’s Flyknit athletic shoes and GE’s Ecomagination technology, which ranges from power to transportation.Food also features strongly, including Chipotle, which has a focus on naturally raised pork, beef and chicken, Whole Foods Market, the first U.S. national supermarket to have its retail operation certified organic, and Unilever, which aims to source all its agricultural ingredients from sustainable farming.These companies' combined revenues from sustainable products amount to more than $100 billion a year, equivalent to the 62 largest economy in the world.Freya Williams, marketing consultant to Fortune 500 companies, says these firms are not only in many cases growing faster than their competitors, but also commanding wider profit margins.Analysis by the consulting group POINT 380 also shows them to give the best returns to shareholders, challenging the myth that business success relies on profit maximization above all else.If you had put $1,000 into these nine companies in June 2010, your investments would by March of this year have been valued at $3,251, compared with $1,932 for a portfolio of more traditional competitors.Williams suggests that another wave of sustainable companies may soon join the elite group of American businesses that have surpassed the “magic” billion-dollar benchmark. These include Warby Parker, Airbnb, The Honest Company, SweetGreen, Patagonia and Method Home.To put this in perspective, Williams says there is only a 0.00006 percent chance of building a company that breaks the billion-dollar revenue ceiling.“These are not boring, crunchy granola companies or obscure B2B suppliers, “ writes Williams, U.S. CEO of sustainability change agency Futerra, in her new book Green Giants. “They are some of the most vibrant, sexy brands out there today.\"“They aren’t trying to compete with the big boys. They are the big boys. And they will be the big boys of the future.”Hunter Lovins, business professor at Bard MBA and sustainability activist, says the billion-dollar brands are successful \"because they have sustainability at the core of everything they do, not in spite of it.\"\"Williams has shown this commitment is the key to prospering in today’s business world and if companies don’t follow their lead, they will not be around in a decade.\"Williams points to six key success factors that have led to the creation of billion-dollar sustainable brands:"}, {"title": "This Pit Bull Went From Likely Euthanasia To Napping With Her Best Cat Friend", "text": "Until a couple of weeks ago, this little doggie was just another pit bull with a skin condition in the shelter, who was looking at some tough odds at making it out alive.It's been a long trip for this young dog, from that to where she is now.Gemma Zanowski, a Washington-based lawyer who runs the nonprofit Tough Love Pit Bull Rescue, saw the pup's shelter photo. She instantly made the decision that this dog's life would have love and snuggles in it, instead of likely euthanasia.\"There was something about her that just spoke to me. When I get that feeling, I get to work,\" Zanowski told The Huffington Post.She named the pup Dylan, after a beloved dog who'd unexpectedly died late last year, and then deployed her team.The doggie was in an Arizona shelter, so logistics were tricky.One friend got Dylan from the shelter. Another brought her to Sara Dent -- herself a lawyer and pit bull rescuer, living in Arizona -- who tended to Dylan for a few days, while arrangements were made for a dispatch to Washington.At Dent's house, too, Dylan found herself nestled up close with the other animals.For example, here she is with Emma, one of Dent's four dogs.\"She was pretty darn adorable,\" Dent says.\"She is such a snuggle bug.\"Within the week, Dylan's chariot arrived in the form of a volunteer pilot named Lucas Ansley, who came to collect the dog and fly her off to Washington.\"Honestly, I cried like a baby,\" says Dent. \"For purely selfish reasons, as I know she will have an amazing new life in Washington and that she is one of the lucky ones to get out of the shelter. I just knew I would miss her sweetness.\"Then even in the air, this lucky puppy was a charmer.\"As a passenger, Dylan was superb,\" says Ansley -- mostly conking out, until the plane was about to land, then looking out the window and taking notice, \"as if to say, 'Well, hello my new home, you're much greener than Arizona.'\"On top of being greener, Dylan's new home has more playmates of a variety of species: children, horses, dogs.And of course there's the cat.His name is Indie, and he's an 11-year Siamese rescue with a stylish wardrobe (Indie doesn't have much fur so the clothes keep him warm) who belongs to Tough Love volunteer Olivia Bradley.Bradley has been looking after Dylan, while she gets a little more socialized, some obedience training and a few more cuddles from the cat.\"Indie and Dylan have snuggled every night and will share the occasional cat nap in a sun spot,\" says Bradley. \"Indie is quite smitten with little Dylan.\"Dylan will stay in foster care for a while, until her skin is all healed up and her social skills are unimpeachable.After that, she'll be made available for adoption -- hopefully, to be taken in by a family who has a willing cat or two (or three or four).And Zanowski will be looking out for the next dog who needs her. Her hope is that each rescued dog will serve as a model, who shows the world that shelter pets are loving, and good, and deserving.\"I believe in redemption,\" Zanowski says. \"We can all do something to solve the problems we see in the world. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take charm. It just takes love.\"Get in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com!"}, {"title": "UNESCO Recognizes Indigenous Rights, Cultures in World Heritage Rules", "text": "Remember the Alamo? UNESCO just did, by including the fabled Texas mission in its  latest designated places of \"outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.\"At the same time, a less publicized UNESCO decision, made by the international body's World Heritage Committee, could have an equally profound and more global impact. UNESCO's rules now recognize Indigenous people as a unique group with distinct rights and require that the \"free, prior, and informed consent\" of affected Indigenous peoples be obtained during the World Heritage Site nomination process.Why is this rule change so important? For one thing, it affirms and respects the contribution of Indigenous peoples to our common heritage, a long-overdue recognition.But it also underscores another reality: Across some of the world's largest and most ecologically important landscapes--including Australia's Outback and North America's boreal forest--Indigenous peoples are taking the lead in preserving nature as well as their cultures.Since 1998, Australia has created 67 Indigenous Protected Areas covering more than 145 million acres--an area larger than California. More than 700 Indigenous Rangers now work for the Australian government, managing the areas using both their traditional knowledge and Western science to protect biodiversity and limit environmental threats. Their work includes using controlled fires to reduce non-native grasses and weeds that compete with native vegetation, and hunting to control feral animals that kill and compete with Australia's unique wildlife.In Canada, Indigenous communities are showing similar leadership. In the Northwest Territories, the Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation is negotiating to manage Thaidene Nene, a region that includes a proposed national park reserve and two territorial protected areas along Great Slave Lake covering 6.4 million acres. The Deline First Nation is asking UNESCO to declare the watershed around Great Bear Lake, North America's fourth largest, as a World Biosphere Reserve, a designation recognizing special areas that show a balance between humans and nature. Other examples abound.One area of particular interest is Pimachiowin Aki, an 8.25-million-acre area of boreal forest east of Lake Winnipeg. For more than a decade, five First Nations communities in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario have been at the forefront of efforts to protect Pimachiowin Aki, a wilderness rich in biodiversity--home to more than 40 species of native mammals, including wolverines, moose, beavers, and timber wolves--that provides vital habitat for threatened woodland caribou populations and at least eight at-risk bird species.Pimachiowin Aki, which means \"The Land That Gives Life\" in the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) language, has an equally important cultural significance to the local Indigenous peoples. Directed by stories told by elders about their ancestors' lives, archeologists have discovered ancient hunting and cooking tools, camps, and burial sites, as well as pictographs on rock faces. Many traditional practices of the past continue today, part of the unbroken chain of Indigenous peoples' life on the land, dating back many thousands of years.UNESCO is now weighing whether to add Pimachiowin Aki to the World Heritage List as a site of outstanding natural and cultural value. The case for designation is strong, but even with the agency's new language about Indigenous peoples, there's a problem. According to the World Heritage Committee's rigid rules, proposed World Heritage Sites that have both outstanding cultural and natural values need two separate nominations and are evaluated under two entirely separate processes. Indigenous communities, for whom nature and culture are inseparably linked, are stymied by such an approach.This artificial separation has held up designation of Pimachiowin Aki. The World Heritage Committee deferred a decision in 2013 amid an internal debate over whether it needed to revise its processes to accurately evaluate, according to committee documents, \"how the indissoluble bonds that exist in some places between culture and nature can be recognized on the World Heritage List.\" Thankfully, the committee has been working since then to revise its approach, and a decision on a revised Pimachiowin Aki nomination may come in 2016.Sophia Rabliauskas of the Poplar River First Nation, a longtime advocate for Pimachiowin Aki and an attendee at the recent UNESCO meetings, says, \"Right from the beginning, the purpose of the project has been to protect the connection between the land and the people and to share it with the world.\" She adds, \"It's been suggested that we separate the two, but they are inseparable for us. There is no distinction. We are the land.\"By adopting new rules on the rights of Indigenous peoples within the World Heritage process--and by working to integrate the review of natural and cultural values in its evaluations--UNESCO has taken important steps in the right direction, which the people of Pimachiowin Aki hope will improve the ability of Indigenous peoples around the world to protect, share, and pass along their heritage.Now, UNESCO has a chance to take the next step. Listing Pimachiowin Aki as a place just as important to humanity as the Alamo or any other World Heritage Site would honor the contribution of Indigenous peoples to the preservation of both unspoiled nature and their irreplaceable cultures. Let's hope UNESCO's World Heritage Committee agrees and further amends its rules to properly--and fully--designate such special places."}, {"title": "Tired Of City-Life Stresses, Many Chinese Return To Farming", "text": "For many rural Chinese, the dream is to live in a big city.

The gruesome phenomenon has sparked serious concerns that toxic chemicals from the blast site -- a warehouse that stored at least 2,500 tons of hazardous chemicals -- have leaked into the river.Chinese officials, however, have denied that the fish deaths are linked to the blasts.Military teams are reportedly “still struggling to decontaminate” the blast site more than a week after the explosions, The Guardian reports.Wastewater runoff near the site of the explosions have been found to contain hundreds of times as much sodium cyanide than is considered “safe.” Sodium cyanide is extremely toxic to humans, even in very small quantities.Chinese authorities, however, have insisted that water samples taken from the river where the dead fish were found on Thursday did not contain toxic levels of cyanide. The fish were found about four miles from the blast site.Deng Xiaowen, head of Tianjin’s environment monitoring center, said the agency would launch an investigation into the fish deaths. He maintained, however, that “it was not uncommon for fish to die en masse in local rivers during summer, due to poor water quality,” per The Guardian.Despite such assurances, residents of the area have expressed skepticism.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Wang Lei, a 47-year-old man at the river banks Thursday, told the New York Times. “There has to be a link between the dead fish and the blast. What else could explain the death of so many?”At least 114 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured in last week’s explosions, which were so powerful that “cars melted and homes crumbled.” According to ABC News, 70 people are still missing.As residents continue to demand answers and compensation for their damaged property, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to thoroughly investigate the disaster.“The incident has caused heavy casualties and property loss,” he said at a Politburo meeting Thursday, per the New York Times. “It was a profound lesson paid with blood.”Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Whales Are Mysteriously Dying In Alaska", "text": "Whales are turning up dead along the Alaska coast in alarming numbers, and scientists so far have no idea what's causing it.Since May, 30 whales have been found dead along the coast, causing the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to declare and \"unusual mortality event\" on Thursday.So far, the toll includes 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale, and four unidentified cetaceans, according to the agency.That compares to just five dead whales in all of last year.\"NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are very concerned about the large number of whales stranding in the western Gulf of Alaska in recent months,\" Dr. Teri Rowles, NOAA Fisheries' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator, said in a news release.Rowles added:\"While we do not yet know the cause of these strandings, our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live. Members of the public can greatly assist the investigation by immediately reporting any sightings of dead whales or distressed live animals they discover.So far, scientists have been able to reach just one of the 30 whale carcasses.\"Alaska has an awful lot of coastline and much of it is difficult to reach,\" NOAA adviser Dr. Bree Witteveen told CBC. \"We can't get to those carcasses more often than not.\"The broadcaster said an additional six dead whales have turned up along the coast of British Columbia, and Canadian authorities are working closely with NOAA.One theory is that a toxic algae bloom, created by warmer-than-usual waters off the West Coast, could be playing a role.“That always concerns us because that means there’s probably a change in overall pathogen exposure, possibly harmful algal blooms and other factors,” Rowles said in news conference on Thursday, according to Alaska Dispatch News.So far, one sample tested negative for a type of toxin produced by algae, but the carcass was so decomposed that it may not be reliable, the Dispatch News reported.The agency also said in an online FAQ that it's \"highly unlikely\" that radiation from Fukushima is playing a role, but that further testing is under way.NOAA said it may take months or years before scientists know for sure what's causing the deaths.It's the first unusual mortality event for whales ever in Alaska, and just the third of any kind in the state. The agency had previously declared such events for pinnipeds in 2011 and sea otters in 2006.The agency has released a map showing where the carcasses have been spotted, with a number of them concentrated in the Kodiak area.NOAA asks that anyone who spots a dead whale or a living distressed whale call the Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 877-925-7773, or contact the U.S. Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16.The agency is also asking that the public not approach or touch the whale.Updates will be posted on a website set up for the unusual mortality event."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - August 20, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Fox 'News' finally finds reason to 'care' about the environment; Hillary Clinton draws a bright green line around Arctic drilling; EPA tells oil and gas industry to cut the methane; Islamic leaders call on Muslims worldwide to act on climate change; PLUS: Water contamination in America's rivers and streams is creating intersex fish...

Using a small vial of orange experimental pollen that looked like Kool-Aid, I dusted my right index finger and, from a ladder in apricot tree #32a, set about touching the pistils of every flower I could reach.Not a bad summer job for an 18-year-old: fertilizing the female organs of hundreds of apricot flowers in a sunny orchard, listening to Grateful Dead tapes via speakers set on top of my lime-green Chevy Nova.Sugar Magnolia, blossom's bloomin'...head's all empty and I don't care.Saw my baby down by the river, knew she had to come up soon for air.Now, many years after that summer of love, I got hives.I'm a first-year beekeeper. My teenagers call me The Beek--as in Bee Geek. And I have to agree, it's impossible to look cool in a white full-length bee suit and veil.But I don't care. I started this hobby to help honeybees. You've heard about colony collapse disorder? Since 2009, beekeepers have been puzzled by the wide-scale deaths of hives that occur in winter. Worker bees abandon the hive, leaving the queen and honey stores. It's a worrisome mystery. Honeybees, I've learned, are responsible for every third bite of food we take. No honeybees? No blueberries, no cauliflower, no apples or melons, no pumpkins or grapes. No wine. The list goes on.I felt compelled to try to help out in a small way. So I took a beekeeping class at a junior college along with about 100 other folks from all walks of life who were similarly motivated.I felt giddy with anticipation (and a little fear) driving home on April 10 with a box of 5,000 buzzing Italian honeybees (and one queen) in my backseat--sort of like a dad carefully driving his first newborn home from the hospital. What I didn't realize at the time was how much trying to help bees would end up helping me.Show Me the HoneyThe honeybees are living at the corner of an organic farm field across the street from my home in a pinewood hive I built from a kit. The swarm took to the hive quickly, drawing out wax comb on the frames of the boxes, and the queen began filling the cells with eggs. I've read that a good queen can lay about 1,500 eggs per day. I must have been blessed with a good queen. It's the end of August and I estimate there are close to 70,000 bees in the colony. The hive is now four boxes high, the top two heavy with honey.I won't harvest this first year--the bees need 60 to 80 pounds of honey for food to survive the winter. (That's the big goal--avoid colony collapse and get 'em into next spring.) But that's fine with me. The bees have given me much more than I'll ever take.Like any hobby--gardening, woodworking, running, fly-fishing--beekeeping is a welcome distraction from the drone of modern life. It's impossible to focus on the stresses of work, managing a home, and worrying about college applications and aging parents when your head is inside a hive of 70,000 ornery stingers that think you're a black bear trying to steal their golden treasure.It Must Have Been the RosesIn the early mornings or evenings, I enjoy walking down the dirt road, past the organic farm field, the wildflowers, and sweet clover to the apiary at the edge of the woods. I'll check on the bees' progress and feed them sugar water mixed with a shot of Honey B Healthy vitamins. Sometimes, I'll just sit on a stump nearby and watch the foragers fly in and out of the hive. \"It's like Newark airport,\" one of my visitors observed recently.Some workers fly straight out rising high above the trees. Others curve left around the honeysuckles toward the field of clover or maybe to the large ring of lavender about half mile to the east. Honeybees can travel 3 to 5 miles in search of nectar. When they find the bounty, they don't selfishly keep it a secret. Rather, they hustle back home to tell their sisters, communicating the directions through an enthusiastic waggle dance. I'm amazed that they can navigate back to a 24-inch hive entrance from a distance of 5 miles, while I still get lost using a GPS.A worker, which is a female bee, lives only 4 to 6 weeks in the summer, so those foragers I'm watching will never taste the honey they are storing for winter. They will be long dead. They are doing this work for their yet-to-emerge sisters and brothers--for the health of the colony. I'm in awe of their dedication to task and the community. A honeybee hive is pure buzzing socialism.I've witnessed the bees defend the colony against intruders, such as hive beetles, robber bees from other hives, yellow jacket wasps, and me. When a bee stings, it's a suicide act because it dies immediately after delivering its weapon into the flesh of its foe, the barbed stinger literally yanking its entrails out of its body as the bee flies away.Man, bees have a tough life. Bears destroy their hives; skunks love to eat them; parasites like the varroa destructor and tracheal mites suck their blood. And we humans are making it even tougher on them. Scientists don't know exactly what's causing the winter colony collapse. Supposed culprits include lack of habitat and availability of diverse sources of pollen and nectar, global warming, viruses, parasites, genetically modified crops, pesticides containing neonicotinoids, even the practice of trucking beehives to farmers' fields and orchards. Who knows the cause? Many experts believe it's a combo deal: the result of a cocktail of insults small and large. The good news is that bees are, in many ways, smarter than us humans. (They've been around for 40 million years!) And each spring they reproduce rapidly. Still, the bees could use our help, and there are some simple things you can do that, even if they don't impact collapse disorder, make sense for the pollinators and their planet.Buzz WorthyAugust 22 is National Honey Bee Day, a great opportunity to learn more about these social insects. Visit a local apiary, buy organic fruits and vegetables for your garden, plant large areas of native plants to create more diverse habitat, and teach a kid that insects like bees are not to be feared but are essential for a healthy Earth. To find Honey Bee Day activities, check with your local beekeepers association. Who knows, if you become intrigued (and I know you will), you might consider becoming a backyard beekeeper.

Photo by Brendon Purdy.After decades of uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions and mounting impacts, we now need an \"all hands on deck\" cooperative approach to develop workable, long-term solutions to climate change. This presents an opportunity for elders and youngers to collaborate, to bridge what climate scientist and \"father of global warming\" James Hansen calls the \"geezer-young person gap.\"Pope Francis writes in his May 2015 encyclical letter \"On Care for Our Common Home\" that \"Each community ... has the duty to protect the earth and to ensure its fruitfulness for coming generations....\" \"We can no longer speak of sustainable development apart from intergenerational solidarity,\" he observes. \"Intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us.\"What Geezer-Young Person Gap?With the Industrial Revolution, the number of generations at many western dinner tables shrank from three to two, with grandparents living elsewhere. The Baby Boom following World War II -- combined with an increase in average life expectancy -- has created growing numbers of retirees. Baby boomers began reaching age 65 in 2011 at the rate of 10,000 people every day in the U.S. Many elders feel cut off from the rest of western society, which considers them to be finished contributing and tends to exclude and think negatively of them.Likewise, many young people are increasingly \"siloed\" - more often with their peers than at the family dinner table, only occasionally with grandparents, and communicating remotely over the internet. Some feel anxiety and dread about climate change.What Elders and Youngers BringElders constitute a huge, untapped resource -- a large number of people with relatively abundant assets. Compared with youngers, many elders have more free time, financial resources, experience, economic and political clout, and sense of connection to nature. They have witnessed environmental changes in ways youngers have not. Because they have observed repeated historical upheavals in their lifetime, many elders take a long view. Aware they may have few years left, elders often work with a sense of urgency and willingness to take bold action.Youngers likewise constitute a huge, untapped resource. It is primarily they who will steer humanity onto a sustainable course. Youngers around the world -- fearing a long future of climate change impacts -- are taking action. Among other assets, they bring energy, idealism, eagerness to learn and grow, and proficiency with social media and the Internet. They provide \"boots on the ground\" at marches, rallies, and other events.Elders and youngers both benefit from collaboration. Youngers appreciate that elders will listen to them, hear them, and back them up. With their encouragement, youngers may be more inclined to practice, test themselves, and lead. In past decades, elders created massive change in the environmental, civil rights, women's rights, and antiwar movements. Now elders groups around the world are taking action on climate change. Youngers can learn from their experiences. Elders benefit by gaining a sense of purpose and contribution, as well as the gratification that their knowledge and skills are valued by youngers. Elders are inspired by the commitment and curiosity of youngers and appreciate their assistance with social media tools and the Internet.While elders and youngers attend events together -- for example, the People's Climate March last September and 350.org workshops -- several non-profit organizations have an explicit mission to bring adults and children together in intergenerational action on climate change.The Norwegian Grandparents Climate Change Campaign (NGCC)NGCC partners with youngers -- for example Miljøagentene The Eco-Agents, an environmental organization for Norwegian children -- to push for climate-protecting policies. Elders and youngers together write letters to government officials, speak to the Parliament, demonstrate in front of the Norwegian Parliament building, meet in schools, attend rallies and marches, and educate the public. NGCC and The Eco-Agents jointly produced a four-page pamphlet that they have distributed to members of Parliament and secondary school students and public libraries across Norway. NGCC and kindergarten children recently protested the climate-damaging draining and excavation of a peat bog located on public property.NGCC, in cooperation with the Norwegian Climate Network, is organizing a train tour of elders and youngers from Oslo to Paris this December for the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). Many organizations are invited to join, among them Nature and Youth. NGCC and youngers will also hold demonstrations in Norway during the COP21 negotiations.Suzuki EldersSuzuki Elders -- a voluntary association of about 100 elders in Canada working with and through the David Suzuki Foundation -- strives to \"mentor, encourage, and support other elders and the younger generations in dialogue and action in the environment.\" The group's intergenerational activities in recent years have included an \"Elders, Environment, and Youth Forum,\" with David Suzuki, his daughter, and his grandson presenting; participation in marches, rallies, conferences, and workshops; creation of an informational video; improvement of social media platforms; retreats on the theme \"Elders and Youth -- Listening to Each Other\"; and workshops on intergenerational storytelling.Suzuki Elders coaches elders to work effectively with youngers. Their tips include going to where youngers are (e.g., public events and social media sites); connecting firmly with one or two who are eager to work with elders; scheduling events for times that work for youngers; providing refreshments; respecting youngers' social media prowess; supporting them without criticizing, directing, teaching, or holding expectations; listening; being patient; and understanding that youngers are busy with school and other activities.No Planeta BNo Planeta B, a nonprofit organization of adults in Peru and the U.S., launched the Cut the Red Tape Project to involve students, parents, and schools in climate change action. Participating schools sign a declaration committing to at least five climate change-mitigation actions, such as going paperless and having meatless Mondays. So far, schools in in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Curaçao, Guyana, Argentina, and the U.S. have signed on. Similarly, parents are invited to sign a declaration committing to at least five actions, such as reducing food waste and walking and bicycling more often. Participants are also circulating a petition calling for strong action at the COP21.According to Executive Director Yoca Arditi-Rocha, No Planeta B will bring together delegations of students, teachers, and school administrators at conferences this fall. Three will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong, and San Francisco in conjunction with Global Issues Network, and one will be held in Miami in conjunction with Climate Reality Project, headed by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.Also planned are a video contest and rallies in schools in at least 10 countries. In December, No Planeta B plans to hold a one-day conference at COP21, which will be attended by delegations of students and adults from Peru, China, the U.S., and other countries. There, No Planeta B will present the declarations and petition to the U.N.Coming TogetherOur prospects for developing effective climate change solutions will improve if elders and youngers increase collaboration and find new ways to combine their talents, skills, and energy. On an international level, elders and youngers can attend COP21 together. On a national level, elders and youngers can participate in the upcoming Grandparents Climate Action Day in Washington, D.C. on September 9 and 10. On a local level, youngers and elders can connect -- through schools, non-profits, clubs, retirement communities, or senior centers -- to learn about climate change and press for solutions. Students and alums can continue pressuring colleges and universities to divest their fossil fuel stock holdings.Elders and youngers working together can not only meet the epic challenge of climate change but also heal age divisions in western societies.

When the shelter's cruelty investigators arrived, they found the animal in awful shape.“She looks pretty horrific,” Houghton told BuzzFeed News. “Her entire head is burnt. There isn’t any skin untouched. Her eyes are burnt. She’s lost all of one ear that was essentially melted off.”The pooch, who was named Rosie, was brought back to the shelter and it was later determined that hydrochloric acid had been thrown on her face, Houghton told HuffPost. Thankfully, Rosie is now on the road to recovery and has been receiving the medical care and TLC that she's always deserved.The pup has even begun to show positive changes in mood.\"The first few days that she was here, she appeared really glum. It was pretty clear she didn't know ... what had happened to her, where she was,\" Lisa Norwood, public relations and outreach manager, told HuffPost. \"[Wednesday], we went in to check on her and we found her wagging her tail. [The day] was filled with tail-wagging and kisses.\"Rosie came to the shelter with a host of health issues.She was underweight and most of the hair on her face had been burned off. The pup, who is also heartworm positive, is blind because of the burns. Her injuries indicate that she likely went weeks without any type of medical care. Houghton hopes the blindness will be temporary, as next week the pup is set to undergo surgery that could potentially restore her vision.Rosie has been making strides though, and gaining weight as well. The animal, who Norwood describes as \"gentle and sweet,\" has a long way to go before she's completely healthy and will need to spend some time rehabilitating. When she's healthy enough, she'll be up for adoption and ready to find a forever home.\"Our greatest hope for her is that she can heal and she can find a happy home,\" Norwood told HuffPost.An investigation regarding Rosie's abuse is currently underway, according to Norwood.To learn more about Rosie, or the San Antonio Animal Care Services Department, visit their Facebook page here.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Most Voters Don't Care About Hillary Clinton's Email", "text": "This past Tuesday I turned on CNN and watched a conservative political pundit go off the rails when she stated that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server was somehow connected to Monica Lewinsky. In that moment I knew Republicans and the blatantly anti-Hillary media had overplayed their hand, as most voters simply don't give a horses' ass about Hillary's email, but instead care deeply about the following four issues that the carnival barkers rarely seem to discuss.   ECONOMIC ACCESS It's no secret that from the purplish Regan-Democrats to the azure blue Warren-Progressives to the ruby red-Republicans to the colorless independents, voters are worried about the shrinking middle class. No issue strikes closer to the heart of the electorate's concerns than the fact that the rich in this country keep getting richer while the rest of us are left scrambling to keep our heads above the water. Instead of endlessly bickering about what information was classified then versus now, why doesn't the news focus on the lives of real Americans that are either looking for work, working more than one job while trying to make ends meet, or holding full-time jobs that have left them far away from achieving the American dream?COLLGE AFFORDABILITY It used to be that you went to college and that led to a better paying job, which in turn brought you home-ownership and a brighter future. However, today many students leave school saddled with extreme debt and little else. While they may eventually be able to get that higher-paying job, the cost of their student loan payments are so astronomical that although the higher salary looks good on paper, they are defaulting on their loans at record rates and would have been better off going directly into the work force than college. I for one would love to see less media scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's Snapchat joke and much more scrutiny of Sallie Mae and the despicable laws that allow for billionaires in our country, like Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, to go bankrupt multiple times and keep their properties, cars, furs, and cash, while the average Joe can't even cancel student loan debt through bankruptcy.RACE, GENDER, AND SEXUAL EQUALITY People across our nation face discrimination every day. African-Americans are being unfairly targeted and often killed in our streets, immigrants live frightened in the shadows of every city across our land, transgender people are attacked and murdered at alarming rates with little outcry from the public, and women are still paid less than men in the workforce. Yet, somehow every time you turn on the television or open up a laptop, the leading headline is about whether or not Hillary was angry when reporters asked her about her server. When video surfaced this week of Hillary pushing the organizers of #BlackLivesMatter to think about what laws and systems they want to change through their important civil rights movement, there was barely a blip of media coverage. Yet that same day countless hours were spent dissecting Mrs. Clinton's off the cuff remark about cleaning her server with a cloth. a clue people...there are far more important matters!ENVIRONMENT Finally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported today that this past July had the highest average temperatures since they began keeping records. The polar ice caps are melting, California is burning, and extreme weather is becoming the norm. We should be in full-fledged panic mode over the viability of our planet due to global warming and its effect on our environment. Yet, on the FoxNews website, one can't even find a mention of this crisis, but rest assured Hillary's email is front and center. Voters want to hear from our candidates about what they are going to do to save mankind from ourselves, not if the GOP-led congress has opened yet another political probe into Hillary.The era of endless breaking news and constant political witch hunts is not going away any time soon, but media beware, voters are sick of being told what to think and want to hear about issues that actually matter. One need only look at how many Trump obituaries political pundits have had to eat like their hats in the past few months to see that the same holds true for the non-existent but overly exploited Hillary email scandal. No matter how much the talking heads and windbags pontificate on the demise of Hillary Clinton because of these stupid emails, we the people are not interested. Stop focusing all of your attention on partisan garbage and focus instead on the things that directly affect the voting population."}, {"title": "'Skeleton' Tigers Forced To Perform For Entertainment", "text": "Thousands of people flooded to the Missouri State Fair this week to get a glimpse of one of the main attractions: a group of performing tigers.

This exceeds the number of people who die from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis -- combined. A Bhutanese and Danish-based group hopes to solve this problem by using existing technology to provide a combination of fuel cookies and smokeless stoves.They are described as \"the forgotten 3 billion\" by WHO. These forgotten 3 billion make up nearly half the world's population and still cook their food on open fires using firewood, coal and animal dung as their fuel. Doing so is not harmless. On the contrary, they are being exposed to high levels of household air pollution that cause a number of diseases ranging from pneumonia to strokes and lung cancer.Women are mostly tasked with the day to day cooking and while spending hours in front of the fires, stirring their pots and keeping a watchful eye on their children, they breathe in the toxic smoke. It is not surprising then that most of the 4.3 million deaths that happen per year are women and children in low- and middle-income countries.The solution to this fatal problem is something as simple as a stove. Smokeless stoves will not only make it safer for people to cook but also help the environment by eliminating black carbon emissions. Stoves alone are however not a long-term solution. People living below poverty line are unable to cope with the high costs for purchase and maintenance of stoves. Therefore, providing a long-term affordable and cleaner alternative is crucial. Household air pollution is not just a threat to the people in front of the fire - it affects all of us. Burning biomass on open fires releases a huge amount of carbon and black carbon, which contributes to global climate change.In the Kingdom of Bhutan alone, a small country located in the Himalayas, 70 percent of households use firewood and other forestry waste for cooking, exposing them to the harmful smoke on a daily basis. The cooperative organization Dazin, based in Bhutan and Denmark, seeks to eliminate household air pollution by their inclusive model of fuel + stove solution. Rural people in Bhutan gives their wood waste to Dazin, instead of burning it in an open fire. This crowdsourced wood waste is made into condensed fuel 'cookie' -- small and efficient briquettes. The rural households get back smokeless cookstove on lease and enough fuel cookies to cover their needs. The surplus fuel made from their crowdsourced wood waste due to the efficiency of Fuel + Stove solution, is sold at a competitive price to urban customers (restaurants, households, schools, etc.) ensuring economic sustainability and further development.Dazin's crowdfunding campaign aims to raise $40.000 by Sunday September the 6th. The funding will initially benefit 2000 people in Bhutan with stoves and fuel cookies in the upcoming winter. Dazin seeks to replicate the concept in other areas and reduce carbon emissions from residential fuel usage.Let's Cook Up a Better Future and give rural communities access to a sustainable fuel source and a smokeless gasifying stove!

From playing in fields and exploring plants and animals to swimming in a lake and inventing new games, there's no shortage of fun activities for the four kids and their two dogs.Looking at these gorgeous photos, we can't help but want to go outside.H/T BoredPandaAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "What Hurricane Katrina Taught Us about Fixing Louisiana", "text": "In the coming days, the media and the pundits will be debating the good and the bad of what's happened to New Orleans in the decade since Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath turned the Big Easy into the dubious poster child of everything that can go wrong in a disaster.First, the good: The restaurants are back, the tourists are back, many--but not all--residents are back, and $14.5 billion has been spent on upgrading levees.Now, the bad: We still have a very long way to go to prevent the large-scale devastation of another mega-storm or tidal surge.How is that possible after all we learned in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina?The issue is not just that storms are getting stronger--though science and technology prove they are. The real problem for New Orleans and all of coastal Louisiana is that the first line of defense--the wetlands that naturally buffer the impact of waves and wind--are disappearing at the shocking rate of one football field an hour.Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles of land. That's an area the size of Delaware just gone, entire communities wiped off the map.The shrinking wetlands also reduce protections for coastal residents, local economies, national industries, and wildlife habitats. We saw this as Louisiana was pummeled by back-to-back hurricanes with Hurricane Rita slamming Southwest Louisiana just four weeks after the eastern side of the state took the hit from Katrina.And this is not just a Louisiana problem. Wetlands are vanishing throughout coastal America under the pressure of development and urbanization and sea-level rise with similarly devastating results: Witness Hurricane Sandy's impact on the New York City area in 2012 and the storms that regularly wipe out Florida's shoreline communities.Who's to blame?In Louisiana's case, the extensive wetlands that once spanned the Louisiana Gulf Coast have been sliced up by oil pipelines and navigation canals. These man-made cuts and channels have allowed salt water to penetrate deep into wetlands, killing the native grasses, trees, and other plants that hold the soils together.So what can we do about it?As it turns out, plenty. There are strong, science-based methods for repairing and bringing back protective coastal wetlands.One of the best solutions is reconnecting the Mississippi River with its delta. The river has been straitjacketed by levees that prevent its sediment from replenishing the wetlands. Instead, it pushes precious amounts of sediment deep into the Gulf of Mexico, far beyond where it can do any good.Audubon has been experimenting with using dredges to build marsh in depleted wetlands. Within a matter of months, the marsh grasses and other plants spring to life and start spreading. And important waterbirds, such as Black-necked Stilts, Greater Yellowlegs, and Tricolored Herons, and marsh birds, such as King Rails, Seaside Sparrows, and Marsh Wrens, start returning.If we know how to fix the problem, why isn't more being done?Money. And political commitment.Louisiana officials estimate it will cost tens of billions of dollars over the next 50 years to restore and preserve the coast and reduce risk for coastal communities. To do it right we need to take on major projects that go to the root of the problem. Band-Aid fixes are not going to work.We have a historic chance for a running start with the proposed settlement with BP for $18.7 billion in penalties for the environmental damages caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil gusher. Louisiana's share is estimated to be up to $8.7 billion dollars.The challenge will be making sure every cent of that money goes to coastal restoration and isn't diverted to other state needs.But the BP money is just a start. Doing the job right will require state and national leadership to fully fund key projects that will result in large-scale restoration. It will also mean protecting the existing federal dollars dedicated to coastal restoration and finding new funding in the future.Why should the rest of the country care what happens on the Louisiana coast?To be sure New Orleans is one of the great cultural and culinary destinations of the United States. And the Gulf Coast is an ecological treasure: Nearly half of North America's bird species use it as a resting or refueling stop at some point in their migrations.But the Louisiana and the Gulf Coast are also powerful economic engines for shipping, energy, and other industries that support millions of jobs across America.If there's one thing we all learned from Katrina, it's that we waited too long. We have to invest in serious restoration of our coasts now. This is not just a Louisiana problem: It's the challenge of virtually every country on the globe that has a coastline.David Yarnold is president and CEO of the National Audubon Society."}, {"title": "'Skeleton' Tigers Forced To Perform For Entertainment", "text": "Thousands of people flooded to the Missouri State Fair this week to get a glimpse of one of the main attractions: a group of performing tigers.

The administration's goal is to cut methane emissions 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA expects to release its final methane rules next year, after it hears public comments.\"Today, through our cost-effective proposed standards, we are underscoring our commitment to reducing the pollution fueling climate change and protecting public health while supporting responsible energy development, transparency and accountability,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a statement. \"Cleaner-burning energy sources like natural gas are key compliance options for our Clean Power Plan and we are committed to ensuring safe and responsible production that supports a robust clean energy economy.\"The rules target new and modified oil and natural gas operations, but as Greenwire reports, they could eventually trigger regulation of methane leakage from the entire sector (subscription). The proposed rules call for oil and gas processing and transmission facilities to locate and repair methane leaks, capture natural gas from hydraulically fractured oil wells and limit emissions from equipment -- actions netting climate benefits of $120 to $150 million in 2025, according to the EPA.As they are now, the proposed rules could achieve a cut of 25 to 30 percent by 2025, according to Janet McCabe, acting assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation. To meet the full 40-45 percent goal, the administration expects to rely on voluntary efforts, state regulations and a Department of the Interior rule covering drilling on public lands.The rules supplement recently announced voluntary initiatives to address methane emissions at existing wells -- emissions that may be greater than the EPA estimates according to new research.A study conducted by scientists at Colorado State University and published in Environmental Science & Technology, quantifies emissions from thousands of gathering facilities, which consolidate gas from wells and feed it into processing plants or pipelines. These emissions have been largely unreflected in federal statistics, the report says, but may be the largest methane source in the oil and gas supply chain. These newly identified emissions would increase total emissions from that chain in EPA's current Greenhouse Gas Inventory by approximately 25 percent.Climate Action DeclarationMuslim scholars from 20 countries issued an \"Islamic Declaration on Climate Change\" on Tuesday, calling on the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to work to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to commit to renewable energy sources.The declaration drawing on Islamic teachings and to be presented at the global climate summit in Paris was finalized at the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium in Istanbul this week.\"The pace of global climate change today is of a different order of magnitude from the gradual changes that previously occurred throughout the most recent era, the Cenozoic,\" the declaration reads. \"Moreover, it is human-induced: we have now become a force dominating nature. Our species, though selected to be a caretaker or steward on the earth, has been the cause of such corruption and devastation on it that we are in danger [of] ending life as we know it on our planet.\"The declaration asks Muslim countries, particularly those that are \"well-off\" and \"oil-producing,\" to lead the greenhouse gas phase out and to provide financial and technical support for climate change efforts by less-affluent states.Alaska and Climate ChangeClimate change could exacerbate one of Alaska's worst wildfire seasons -- one that has burned some 5 million acres of tundra and forests and ignited fears that large stores of carbon are being emitted into the atmosphere.\"We really need to start considering the long-term implications of big fires that are being predicted,\" said Nicky Sundt, a climate change expert for the World Wildlife Fund. \"In the Arctic, you have a lot of carbon locked up, and the fires will release that. We need to start thinking seriously about the carbon emissions from these fires.\"A recent Climate Central analysis shows that in the last 60 years large wildfires in Alaska have essentially doubled and that the wildfire season is 40 percent (35 days) longer than it was in the 1950s, mainly due to rapid warming in the globe's northern reaches.\"The primary driver is temperature. The warmer we get, the more fires we seem to get,\" Mike Flannigan, a wildland fire expert at the University of Alberta, said. \"We need a 15 percent increase in precipitation to account for the warming. Very few climate models suggest there will be an increase in precipitation to compensate for the increase in temperature. The fuels will be drier in the future and it will be easy to start the spread of fire.\"Of particular concern -- drying of peat, which then becomes susceptible to burning and release of centuries' worth of carbon in the span of a few hours of intense fire. Teresa Hollingsworth, a researcher and ecology professor with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told NPR that many of the state's fires burned seven feet deep, where vast amounts of carbon are stored.\"The carbon released from fire emissions during a large fire year in Alaska is roughly equivalent to 1 percent of the global fossil fuel and land use emissions,\" said Dave McGuire, a research scientist and leader of the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, in a recent press release.Obama is visiting the state at the end of this month to highlight climate change impacts that go beyond fires.\"In Alaska, glaciers are melting,\" Obama said in a video released last week. \"The hunting and fishing upon which generations have depended for their way of life and for their jobs are being threatened. Storm surges once held at bay now endanger entire villages. As Alaskan permafrost melts, some homes are even sinking into the ground. The state's God-given natural treasures are all at risk.\"The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each Thursday by Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions."}, {"title": "Toxic Chemicals Taint The 'Best Possible' Food For Babies", "text": "Nature created the perfect food for a growing baby. A mother's breast milk is chock full of the essential vitamins, fats, proteins and carbohydrates needed to best build the brain, fight infection and resist chronic disease. But as new research published on Thursday reminds us, a mother's milk today also contains a cocktail of industrial chemicals.\"It's really an absurd situation that women who are breastfeeding have to think about what chemical exposures they might contribute to their child,\" said Philippe Grandjean, an environmental health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and author of the study. \"Breast milk is supposed to be the best possible nutrition for the infant.\"And it still is, Grandjean and other experts emphasize. It's just less pure and healthy than nature intended -- and than we previously believed. Researchers have already found that a number of fat-loving chemicals can hitch rides into newborns via breast milk. Flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, such as DDT, are just some of the known pollutants.In the new study, Grandjean and his team tested the blood of 81 children born in the Faroe Islands between 1997 and 2000 for a class of chemicals that don't have the same affinity for fat: perfluorinated alkylate substances, or PFASs. For every month that a mom exclusively breastfed, they found her baby's blood levels of these common water- and stain-proofing chemicals increased by an average of 20 to 30 percent. Partial breastfeeding led to lower increases.Researchers discovered that the children's levels of PFASs exceeded those Grandjean's previous research had deemed safe. That research found that higher exposure to PFASs can make childhood vaccinations less effective. The chemicals are also suspected of causing cancer and disrupting normal hormone functions, noted Grandjean.You probably know PFASs as the stuff that protects your carpet from stains, keeps your food from sticking to packaging or pans, repels rain from your coat and prevents mascara from running down your cheeks. It likely even lines the waxy paper that held your morning pastry.And your body has likely been acquainted with the chemicals since you were in the womb, or drinking breast milk. \"These compounds stay in your body for years and years,\" said Grandjean.He suggested that the new findings surprised him. How did these chemicals, as pervasive and long-lasting as they are, get into milk in such high quantities? In addition to having a high fat content, breast milk is also packed with protein. So protein may offer chemicals a similar \"ride into the milk,\" Grandjean explained. Unfortunately, this implies that other, previously unsuspected toxins may also be contaminating breast milk.\"We happened to find this for perfluorinated compounds. Who knows when we'll find the next scandal like this?\" he said. \"For infants to be exposed at this early and vulnerable age is something that worries me greatly.\"Still Breastfeed, If You CanAsa Bradman, an environmental health expert at the University of California, Berkeley, underscored that mothers should not be fearful about breastfeeding. His own research has concluded that even among children whose mothers had high blood levels of DDT, those who were breastfed experienced healthier development than their formula-fed peers.Given his findings, Grandjean suggests that the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the risks, for at least a baby's first 3 to 4 months of life.And the benefits of breastfeeding extend to the mother. Women who are able and choose to breastfeed may more quickly shed pregnancy pounds. The practice can improve a mother's bond with the baby, and can even save the family money. Breast milk, unlike formula, is free.What's more, opting for formula doesn't necessarily protect an infant from dangerous chemicals, since community water supplies can carry high levels of PFASs. In a separate report also published on Thursday, the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found that even tiny concentrations of a PFASs chemical in drinking water can pose a serious threat to public health. The group refers to Grandjean's previous research, which concluded that the EPA's provisional drinking water limit for PFOA and PFASs, set in 2009, is between 100 and 1000 times too high.And if all that isn't enough to encourage breastfeeding, experts note that the practice can also decrease a mother's own burden of toxic chemicals.\"Nursing a baby is the ultimate detox diet,\" writes Florence Williams in her book Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History. As she explains, mothers who breastfeed for a year can \"siphon off\" to their infants 90 percent of their body burden of perfluorinated compounds, including PFASs.In the new study, some of the children’s blood levels of PFASs exceeded that of their mothers' by the end of breastfeeding.Of course, therein lies the irony -- and the trouble. Is breast milk just another way we pass our pollution problems on to the next generation?'Kicking The Can Down The Road'Bill Walker, an investigations editor for the Environmental Working Group, suggested PFASs are a \"poster child\" for what is wrong with current toxic chemical regulation in the U.S. While the EPA was first alerted in 2001 to the class of chemicals contaminating drinking water, he noted, the agency remains another six to seven years away from enacting regulations.Experts raise similar concerns over the sources of these chemicals.By the end of 2015, some of the most notorious PFASs will be fully phased out of production in the U.S. \"These voluntary industry efforts have resulted in reduction of these substances in the environment,\" wrote Jessica Bowman, the executive director of the FluoroCouncil, an arm of the industry group American Chemistry Council, in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post. “To help support that phase-out, our member companies developed alternatives, based on short-chain PFAS. The alternatives are some of the most robustly-studied new chemicals introduced into the market.\"But as HuffPost reported in May, experts worry this new group of PFASs may still share many of the same concerning characteristics as their predecessors. They also say this pattern of simply replacing known toxins with their chemical cousins, whose safety may remain largely unknown, is a result of the nation's outdated toxic chemical legislation, which allows chemicals to remain innocent until proven guilty.\"The way the Toxic Substances Control Act is set up now, it's a dangerous experiment being conducted on all of us,\" said Walker. \"Chemical companies are allowed to expose us to their products without knowing whether or not they're safe.\"\"We're just kicking the can down the road. We're letting our children worry about it,\" added Tracey Woodruff, director of the University of California, San Francisco Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment.The U.S. Senate will be reconvening to consider an update to the nearly 40-year-old TSCA this fall. The bipartisan proposal has faced stiff criticism from some environmental health advocates.\"The bill has not gone far enough in terms of protecting state preemption and really reflecting the state of the science on chemical risks,\" said Woodruff. \"But there's a lot of pressure to make something happen.\"While prospective and young mothers can take some precautions of their own, such as avoiding products that contain nonstick, stain-resistant, and waterproof coatings, their power to protect their progeny from tainted breast milk is limited. \"You'd have to start as a teenager to prevent the buildup over time,\" said Grandjean. \"That's not something that new moms can do much about.\"\"I'm calling for more research attention on the passage of industrial chemicals into human milk. We are not testing for that,\" he added, noting that the FDA requires drug companies to provide information about whether their products are safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. \"But with industrial chemicals, we assume that they are safe.\"\"Breasts, it turns out, are a particularly fine mirror of our industrial lives,\" Williams wrote in her book. And this fact may actually attract needed attention and drive change. It was after persistent organic pollutants began appearing in human milk, for example, that countries took steps to ban them.\"Breast milk carries some political weight,\" she wrote."}, {"title": "How Our Government Could Alter the Coast We Know and Love", "text": "My career studying oil spill impacts came about by accident - an actual accident. I was establishing field experiments in a coastal lagoon when the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill occurred through a blowout at a nearby oil platform. My experiments ruined, I volunteered in oil response efforts and in reviewing shoreline impact studies. Oil had touched me then and would do so again.In 1989, I was appointed to the Oil Spill Trustees science review panel after the Exxon Valdez disaster, ultimately making dozens of trips to Alaska to integrate efforts by teams of researchers working to understand the fate of the oiled coasts and coastal life and to forecast how long recovery might take. We knew this research was critical to a new understanding of offshore oil drilling risks and future spills.And future spills happened. The nation watched as grainy camera images depicted failed efforts to stem oil gushing from the sea floor for 87 days following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The dark oil plumes that spread over increasing areas of the sea surface showed that we - the country and the oil and gas industry - were again woefully unprepared to mount an effective response. And now attention is focused on Santa Barbara once may in the wake of the May 19 spill on Refugio Beach.A decision looms now for the South Atlantic coast, where the Department of the Interior is deciding whether to open the seafloor from Virginia to Georgia to oil and gas leasing - a shift in federal and state policies.   For judging the merit of offshore oil drilling in my own backyard, I pose four questions: What is the potential oil yield versus costs of extracting it? What are the obvious risks of oil drilling off our South Atlantic Coast? Is scientific study of ocean physics, biologically valuable resources, and socioeconomics of coastal communities sufficient to predict impacts and direct effective response actions to prevent a spill from becoming catastrophic? Are there viable energy alternatives to offshore oil drilling?The answer to each question reveals that oil drilling off North Carolina and the other Southeast states risks much for the many and gains little for a few.First, known oil and gas reserves off North Carolina are very small - maybe enough to supply the U.S. with gas for two months and oil for nine, and at depths that make drilling expensive and risky.Second, serious risks are clear and far-reaching to our coastal economies, cultures, seafood harvests, and human communities from Georgia to Virginia. Our southern coasts are home to some of the country's most attractive beaches, extensive seagrass, oyster reef, and marsh habitats, and a wealth of spectacular marine organisms.Our Southeast coastal economy is based upon this clean and healthy environment - from tourism and fishing to real estate development and retirement industries. These industries would be threatened by oil drilling, not just from the threat of a major blowout and spill but from the many small spills, discharges, and releases happening daily. The collateral heavy industrialization that follows oil production, from pipelines to refineries, would conflict with the livable communities, vacation meccas, and the retirement industry of the Southeast coast.Third, based on both a review of available scientific information and considering the response failures to contain the Exxon Valdez spill and cap the Deepwater Horizon blowout, I conclude that more science and technology are needed. Lacking are: (a) verified dynamic 3-D ocean circulation models off the Southeast coast to enable accurate prediction of the fate of spilled oil; (b) full functional understanding of globally unique habitats such as \"The Point\" off Cape Hatteras, and the floating Sargassum ecosystem, both of which support populations of valuable fishes, sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals; and (c) detailed socioeconomics for human communities and resources at risk all along the Southeast coast.Experience makes it difficult to trust the oil and gas industry to conduct the technical research and development needed to maintain preparedness to nip oil pollution disasters in the bud. The recent news that the latest Santa Barbara spill may have been caused by a corroded pipe only serves to further undermine my faith in the industry's technical readiness.Lastly, is there an alternative? We have a wealth of renewable energy opportunities in the Southeast, and North Carolina's potential for offshore wind energy production may be the greatest in the country. Offshore renewable energy development would bring well-paying, high-tech jobs to local people. The societal consequences of success for us Southeast Atlantic coastal residents are nowhere near as bright with offshore oil drilling as they are with wind.This issue is not about ensuring sufficient scientific research on ecosystem responses to oil spills - it's about the fishermen I see every day, the neighbors who escape outside with me for long beach walks, the retirees and vacationers, and the many others whose lives depend on our coastal environment and resources, such as realtors and surf shop owners. This decision by our federal government could forever alter the coast we know and love."}, {"title": "Through Your Lens: 9 Volcanoes Around The World That Will Take Your Breath Away", "text": "The WorldPost's \"Through Your Lens\" series brings you mesmerizing photos taken by social media users in different countries around the world every week.Volcanoes, formed by magma rising from the Earth's crust, are formidable forces of nature.

I had the honor of participating in the Symposium in Istanbul and speaking as the Jewish representative in the interfaith session of the event.Istanbul served as a fitting venue for the Symposium, since it reveals many of the causes of and solutions to climate change. Home to fourteen million people, it is Europe's largest city, the fifth largest city in the world, and has grown ten-fold since 1950. Its metro is the third largest in the world, with 800,000 daily riders, and a separate Metrobus system has 600,000 daily riders. Car ownership is low compared to elsewhere in Europe, with 75% of the population relying on alternative forms of transportation. Yet, according to the World Bank, Istanbul's sulfur dioxide combined with its vehicular and industrial air pollution makes it the seventh most polluted city in the world. Istanbul has been engaged in a fast rate of economic growth for the past 20 years and boasts the largest number of shopping malls of any European city.Istanbul also likely has the greatest number of vendors standing between lanes of car traffic selling water on a hot August day. Undoubtedly, some of these vendors are among the 1.7 million Syrian refugees Turkey has absorbed due to the neighboring conflict. A recent scientific study contends that the war started in part due to a four-year drought exacerbated by climate change. Thomas Friedman reminds us today of the way climate change is impacting the Middle East in his eye-opening piece, \"The World's Hot Spot.\"A Muslim megacity that is growing rapidly in population and material wealth - two main drivers of climate change - therefore served as an apt site for an Islamic Climate Change Symposium. The Symposium centered upon the launch of the Islamic Climate Change Declaration. Muslim clerics gathered with clergy of other faiths to offer, in the words of the Declaration, an \"urgent and radical reappraisal\" of modern society. The Symposium delivered a moral call to change course. The Declaration stated, \"We note with alarm the combined impacts of rising per capita consumption combined with the rising human population\" (p. 2).The Declaration was put forth as a Muslim teaching on care for our common home, exactly two months after the release of Pope Francis' groundbreaking Encyclical, Laudato Si. A Catholic symposium on climate change: People and Planet First, took place in late June, organized by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and CIDSE.The Islamic Declaration reads with a similar air of spiritual richness and scientific calculation as Laudato Si, although it is less lengthy, and the world's 1.7 billion Muslims do not recognize a unifying religious authority like the Pope. Nevertheless, three Grand Muftis, clerics from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Indonesia endorsed the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change and spoke at the Symposium. Speaker information can be viewed here.The Declaration was written by an international group of Islamic scholars, with a vision to draw on their ancient tradition to provide solutions to the modern crisis of climate change. These scholars include Prof. Din Syamsuddin, President of the Indonesian Ulama (Islamic Scholars) Council, representing Indonesia's 200 million Muslims, and Fazlun Khalid, founder of the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environment Sciences (IFEES). The Symposium was co-organized by IFEES, GreenFaith, and Islamic Relief Worldwide, and drew significant international figures, including the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, Ibrahim Thiaw.The Declaration incorporates this excerpt from the Koran: \"Corruption has appeared on land and sea. Because of what people's own hands have wrought, so that they may taste something of what they have done; so that hopefully they will turn back\" (30:41). Based on this, the Declaration states,We recognize the corruption (fasad) that humans have caused on the Earth due to our relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption. Its consequences have been-- • Global climate change, which is our present concern, in addition to: • Contamination and befoulment of the atmosphere, land, inland water systems, and seas; • Soil erosion, deforestation and desertification; • Destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of the habitats of the earth's communities of life, with devastation of some of the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems such as rainforests, freshwater wetlands, and coral reefs; • Impairment of ecosystem benefits and services; • Introduction of invasive alien species and genetically modified organisms; • Damage to human health, including a host of modern-day diseases.Notably the Declaration also states, \"We call on the people of all nations and their leaders to...Realize that to chase after unlimited economic growth in a planet that is finite and already overloaded is not viable. Growth must be pursued wisely and in moderation\", and \"We call upon corporations, finance, and the business sector to change from the current business model which is based on an unsustainable escalating economy, and to adopt a circular economy that is wholly sustainable.\"I am impressed by the breadth and profundity of what is written in this Declaration. It is not only about climate change, but about 'care for our common home' in a broad sense. It reminds me of a teaching of Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler: \"Human beings believe, in their arrogance, that if they continue developing the world on the basis of an ever-expanding science and technology, they will eventually achieve an environment that will afford everyone unlimited gratification of the senses and a life of untrammeled ease and pleasure. There can be no greater error than this.\"The organization that I founded and direct, the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development, will soon present the Arabic version of the Declaration to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.To quote Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, I was \"witness to the dignity of difference and the power of faith to heal a fractured world.\" I am proud to have taken part in this significant step forward for the world's Muslims and all of humanity, and to find common cause with my Muslim brothers and sisters in faith to enable our children to inherit a livable planet.Sarah Lyons and Dalia Gladstein contributed to this post.

I took my senior high school portrait on that grass. My wife and I were married on that grass. Up until last year, we held our kids’ Easter egg hunts on that grass.Not any more. My parents spent a good month tearing out that grass this summer in favor of redwood mulch, river rock and drought/deer-tolerant vegetation. Removing the lawn was a painful process, both for the back and for a scrapbook full of grassy-knoll memories, but it was a major reason why they were able to slash their water use this summer.Photo by Brian Milne.Greywater Garden Irrigation SystemWe’ve always had a greywater irrigation system for the rose garden. It just made sense with a washer located on the back part of the house, just a few feet from the rose garden.All it took was running a small hose out of the back of the washer to the garden out back, which receives a few gallons of greywater runoff every time a load of wash runs.The good news for Californians is that greywater system regulations have improved because of a lack a water resources. Some agencies even provide financial incentives for buildings that reuse water for irrigation purposes.Photo by Brian Milne.Portable ShowerOn the coast of California, we're pretty fortunate to live so close to one of our largest water resources in the Pacific Ocean. But as we all know, desalination plants are expensive, and there’s only so much we can do with saltwater currently.Additionally, many coastal towns such as drought-parched Cambria, as well as California state parks, have cut back water use and no longer have running water for the public, whether that be for outdoor showers or even flush toilets.Along the California coast, the new norm is port-a-potties and disinfectant gel, so more and more residents are starting to bring their own water when they head to the beach.I enjoy surfing with the kids on the weekends, so to help cut down public water use, I've turned an unused Roundup Weed Killer spray bottle into a mobile shower. It’s portable, pressurized and person-powered so it won’t drain your battery. I’ve even painted the jug black, so the water warms in the sun while we’re in the water.In the end, my post-surf showers use less than 2 gallons of water, which is about 15 gallons less than the average American uses when showering on a given day.Photo by Brian Milne.While we're on the topic, another good way to save water while showering at home is to put a 5-gallon bucket under the faucet and capture excess water as it warms for irrigating your plants. We save a gallon or two per shower using this method in our master bathroom, located on the opposite side of the house from our water heater.Rain Gutter Water CaptureWhen it does finally rain, like it did this past July when we saw 3.5 inches in two days, we need to be prepared with not only flood protection for our barren landscapes, but with rain-capture projects that guide runoff to key areas, reservoirs or tanks for future use.As with greywater systems, I tend to fall back on simple rain-capture devices. One easy one is to put buckets under your rain gutter runoff points to capture water that would otherwise run into the gutter.During a July thunderstorm, I was able to fill trashcans with water each night by removing the endcaps on our rain gutter and placing the cans under the drop points. After cleaning our rain gutters out, I nearly filled a yard waste container on the final night of the storm, using the water for landscape irrigation.While many of these techniques are simple and don't take a ton of cutting-edge technology, they also don't take a ton of effort and show just how easy it is to implement sustainable-water projects around the house.Here’s to more rain, and water conservation projects, in coming months!Have a creative home water conservation project worth sharing?

The video of Clinton's response is painful to watch, in part because it's so emblematic of the cautiousness and doublespeak that even her supporters wish their candidate would move away from.\"I am not going to second guess [President Barack Obama] because I was in a position to set this in motion,\" Clinton said, referencing the pipeline review process that she oversaw as Secretary of State. \"I want to wait and see what he and Secretary Kerry decide.\"She then followed up with what might be one of the worst rejoinders ever delivered from the campaign trail, \"If it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.\" Translation: vote for me, and then I'll tell you what I stand for. It's the sort of answer that subverts the entire idea of having an election in the first place.Within a few hours, a video of the fumble was plastered across nearly every major news site in the country. Politico called the answer a \"dodge,\" while the Times said that Clinton seemed \"stumped,\" and the Washington Post labeled the whole thing a \"ridiculous hedge.\" Clinton's opponents also jumped all over the misstep. \"Well, listen, needless to say, I have a hard time understanding that response,\" Bernie Sanders told ABC. \"I have helped lead the effort against the Keystone pipeline.\"Clinton, on the other hand, has done rather the opposite. Back in 2010, before the pipeline had even gone through an initial review process at the State Department, Clinton said she was \"inclined to approve\" the project. The process she then oversaw was so riddled with controversy and incompetence that the State Department was forced to go back to the drawing board multiple times, while their own inspector general investigated the department over serious conflict of interest allegations.Other allegations centered around Hillary Clinton herself. One of Clinton's 2008 deputy campaign managers, Paul Elliot, went on to become a lead lobbyist for TransCanada, the company looking to build Keystone XL. For her 2016 campaign, Clinton has hired a another lobbyist, Jeffrey Berman, whose firm received $120,000 to lobby the State Department for the Keystone XL's approval. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars in donations from ExxonMobil, who stands to profit handsomely from the expansion of the Canadian tar sands, as well as donations from Canada's Foreign Affairs, Trade and Management agency, which supports the pipeline.All these swirling connections only reinforce the perception created by the controversy over Clinton's deleted State Department emails: she's crooked, compromised, and has something to hide. A pipeline approval would cement that reputation. As Clinton said herself, she set this whole crazy, mismanaged review process in motion. If Keystone XL goes forward, it won't just ruin President Obama's climate legacy: it will take out Clinton's as well.Which isn't to say that Clinton's record on climate is much to begin with. During her tenure as Secretary of State, Clinton oversaw the U.S. involvement in the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks. As Mother Jones documented, Clinton's State Department went on to sell fracking around the world, muscling weaker nations into expanding oil and gas development. All of which has been adding up to headlines like this one: \"Why Environmentalists Are Anxious About Hillary Clinton.\"Clinton seems to know that she has a climate credibility gap, and understands that she's in a bind on Keystone XL. And her campaign must recognize that's going to be a problem when it comes to reaching out to the voters she needs to win a Democratic primary and carry her through the general election. Those dual realizations have led to some interesting maneuvering as of late.Earlier this week, the Associated Press reported that Clinton was seeking to make up lost ground on climate issues. On Tuesday, she came out against Arctic drilling, tweeting \"The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling.\" That's a significant move. Scientists have made it clear that in order to keep global warming below 2°C we must keep 100% of Arctic oil in the ground: there's simply no room in the atmosphere for setting off that carbon bomb. Yet the oil industry, and Shell in particular, have turned the Arctic their Holy Grail (an oil filled one, that is). Standing up the industry and saying no is something the Obama administration has so far failed to do. Clinton's stance is a big improvement.But that still leaves the question of Keystone XL. In a follow up question on the pipeline, Clinton said that she \"would really hope\" a decision on the pipeline comes soon. \"But I am getting impatient,\" she continued, \"because I feel that at some point a decision needs to be made. And I'm not comfortable saying, you know, 'I have to keep my opinion to myself' given the fact that I was involved in it. So at some point I may change my view on that.\"That change in view would be welcomed by Keystone XL opponents, as it should be by Clinton supporters. Just because the pipeline has mostly been a problem for Clinton doesn't mean that it can't now become an opportunity. While a Keystone XL approval would sink her ability to reach out environmental voters, progressives and young people--all of whom have opposed Keystone XL in the hundreds of thousands--a muscular rejection would provide Clinton with an opening.To take advantage of it, she'll have to do more than waffle back and forth about an \"all of the above\" energy strategy or just wave around razzmatazz proposals like \"500 million solar panels.\" She'll need to join candidates like Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley by coming out for a full transition away from fossil fuels and towards 100% renewable energy. She'll need to talk seriously about environmental justice, and the impacts that projects like Keystone XL, and the climate impacts they cause, have on vulnerable communities. And she'll need to say that this pipeline is just a start: as President, she'll work to find more ways to stand up to Big Oil and keep fossil fuels in the ground.Let's hope the next time Hillary Clinton gets a question about Keystone XL she's prepared with the right answer: \"I would reject it...and that would be just the beginning.\""}, {"title": "My Tour Through Our National Parks With Members of Congress", "text": "Under a sky pregnant with stars, his laser pointer stroking constellations and planets as he named them, astronaut Story Musgrave told his audience,\"This is the first time in history that humans are taking most of our information from 'content' developed by other humans, and almost completely ignoring nature.

So much \"content\" and \"information\" from innumerable sources, but little of it points us to beauty, to our shared values as human beings, or to the \"truths we hold to be self-evident.\"I am sometimes tempted to tune it all out, EXCEPT that I've toured 171 units of our National Park System and I KNOW the struggle, the blood, sweat, tears, the courage endurance that it took to get our country to the state where every American has a voice.

However, bulk donation programs wreck the market and the customer's perception of solar as a concept.Solar products need to be deployed and serviced with the highest quality of customer satisfaction in mind. Mainstream bulk donation programs often do not budget for high quality products or invest in the distribution and after-sales service required for solar, leaving customers with either inferior products or, over time, faulty products that stop working and spoil the market concept of solar in general.In their recent June 2015 Opinion Brief, the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association highlights the issue:\"Systematic reductions on retail prices, and especially free give-aways, signal to consumers that they do not need to pay full retail price -- or pay at all -- for these goods, and consumers will accordingly hold out for reduced-cost or free goods in the future, regardless of whether they will ever come. While there may be a short term benefit for selected users, these reductions or give-aways will result in such adoption being less likely to be sustained and broader adoption of solar off-grid lighting being significantly hampered.\"The tainted history of donating solar products to households is long and well-known by the industry, which makes SkyPower's initiative puzzling and to some down-right upsetting. From political campaigns, charities and corporate CSR, donating solar products to households has been done decades over with similar results - A flashy article and photo op for the organization, smiling faces of recipients, and the feel-good effect of thinking something good has been accomplished. It's understandable to want to help when heart strings are pulled at the sight of energy poverty. However the reality of donating solar to the masses is a dark one because of the long term down side such \"dump and run\" efforts produce.Distributed energy solutions such as solar home kits are the cheapest, fastest and safest solution to take a family out of poverty overnight, if deployed using market principles of quality and service. They support increased income-generating hours, better and longer home and study conditions for women and children, and overall upward mobility. Ironically, donating solar to a family seems like a worthy endeavor, but without the right infrastructure and investments to support it typically leaves families with very poor experiences which is arguably worse than doing nothing at all. Losing new energy customer by giving free, inferior products and / or poor infrastructure to support them results in a U-turn in energy access development, not to mention it distorts the market conditions and disrupts the growth of record investments being deployed into the industry.US President Barack Obama's Power Africa concurs and backs a strong market-based environment for energy access to thrive: \"Power Africa supports bringing increased electricity access to Kenya through a market-based approach. Kenya is the center of innovation in off-grid solar and is the home to trusted companies -- many of which are Power Africa partners-- who offer high-quality products with strong warranties and service guarantees.\"SkyPower has big, bold plans for Africa and beyond and there's no doubt we need SkyPower's valuable contribution to deploy clean energy for the world. With a revised plan, many beyond-the-grid companies and organizations might like to partner with SkyPower to support their objectives for energy access, however, alternatives in the case of solar kit donations into Kenya would have to be considered. Several attempts were made for on-record comments from Kerry Adler, SkyPower's CEO for this article to better understand SkyPower's plans and discuss constructive alternatives, however, Mr. Adler did not show up for schedules calls. In light of the missed opportunity, SkyPower and Mr. Adler may consider the following:SolarCity's GivePower program offers a best-in-class example for when it's appropriate to donate IFC Lighting approved solar systems, such as to schools and health clinics backed with on the ground service operators.Alternatively, natural disaster relief programs such as the deployment into Nepal this past spring demonstrate an effective use of the donation platform with certified quality products.On the commercial side, SkyPower might consider setting up a working capital fund using the budget allocated to procure product for donation, and instead support beyond-the-grid companies already working in Kenya through deployment of working capital to fuel their efforts.IFC Lighting Global echoes these recommendations:\"Lighting Africa welcomes the participation of companies in the off-grid energy space. Free products can assist people that may not otherwise purchase a solar product, but, if not managed well, they can harm the entire supply chain and the market. Given that consumers spend between $90 - $120 per year on kerosene for lighting, Lighting Africa believes that making solar products more affordable will have the greatest impact on accelerating energy access. We recommend setting up financing facilities with local banks and MFIs to support further sales of solar products with a focus on sustainable positive impact.\"As a veteran energy access entrepreneur I have seen first-hand the market destruction of bulk donation programs. I have no doubt SkyPower has good intentions behind their plans, yet the Canadian company may wish to think twice before letting loose a wayward bull in Kenya's fast growing energy access market that could wreck the market for decades to come."}, {"title": "Parrot Detained By Police For Shouting Obscenities", "text": "It sounds bird-brained, but officers in the Indian city of Rajura detained a parrot for allegedly cursing at an 85-year-old woman.The parrot's name is \"Hariyal,\" and he was reportedly trained for two years in the finer points of obscenity by his owner, Suresh Sakharkar for the sole purpose of abusing his 85-year-old stepmother, Janabai.\"On seeing me, the parrot uses bad language and foul words.

Republican candidates continue to use stock phrases like \"I'm not a scientist,\" but at least they are talking about climate change.We've come a long way.When I started working at the NRDC Action Fund in 2004, climate change barely registered on the political landscape. I was coming off of Capitol Hill and most of my time was spent on parks and water issues, which we were just starting to think of in terms of climate change. Most voters were concerned about the war in Iraq, No Child Left Behind, and the latest episode of Desperate Housewives--it was before streaming, after all. Global warming, as we called it then, was the focus of policy wonks and researchers and few others.Then something shifted: climate change started hitting home in painful and costly ways. Nine out of the 10 hottest years ever occurred since 2002. We witnessed the destructive power of storms like Katrina and Sandy and became accustomed to using the words \"record-breaking\" when we talk about everything from snowfalls to wildfires. People's lives were turned upside down by climate impacts, and Americans began calling on leaders to do something about it.Now that I have decided to leave the NRDC Action Fund to return to my roots to head up the Ohio Environmental Council and its Action Fund, I can't help but reflect on the progress made by my amazing NRDC colleagues and the larger environmental movement.Not only have we helped secure policies to limit carbon pollution from power plants and cut climate change pollution from new cars in half by 2025--saving drivers $80 billion a year at the pump, but we have also helped put climate change on the campaign map. Candidates hoping to win the White House, the governor's mansion, or a Congressional seat in 2016 must discuss the climate threat.It's been an honor to be a small part of this transformation. It's also been an incredible learning experience. It turns out, for instance, that PowerPoint Presentations can win Oscars, but voters still don't want to hear about carbon wedges. And Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) can throw all the snowballs he wants on the Senate floor, but he can't fool the majority of Americans into denying climate change.Local Climate Stories Move Voters: When Gary Peters ran for Senate from Michigan, he didn't talk about worldwide CO2 emissions or sea-level rise. He described how climate change was hurting the Great Lakes and other beloved people and places in Michigan. And he celebrated the 80,000 green goods and services jobs in the state. He also took on the Koch brothers, who were responsible for polluting waterways in the state and funding the opposition. He won, and he confirmed the power of connecting the dots between global climate change, the fossil fuel cronies, and voters' daily lives.Running Clean Works: NRDC Action Fund research has confirmed that candidates who campaign on clean energy and climate action from the beginning win--including Senators Jon Tester (D-MT) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in 2012 to Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) in 2014. Clean energy provides a positive, solutions-based narrative to talk about issues that matter most to Americans: jobs, the economy, and the health of their families.Big Money Is Here to Stay: Political time can be measured in two epochs: before the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling spilled millions of unregulated dollars into political campaigns, and after. It's a fact of life now that spending has reached staggering heights. Fossil fuel industry spent more than $721 million in the 2014 election cycle alone. But the last presidential election proved that even that much money can't buy you love. Despite the Koch brothers' best efforts, clean energy and climate champions won up and down the ticket.The Fight Is Spreading to the States in an even Bigger Way: Now that the Clean Power Plan has established limits on carbon pollution from power plants, each state can figure out how it will achieve its reductions. This is a huge opportunity to create new jobs and save people money on energy bills. But it is also a chance for naysayers to try to delay and interfere at the state level. That's one reason I am joining the Ohio Environmental Council: I want to help set the bar high for climate action and clean energy growth in the Midwest.Time to Paint Climate Stonewalling as Extremism: Republicans in Congress are trying to block the Clean Power Plan, and every GOP presidential candidate has decried it. Yet not a single one has offered a plan for tackling what is the biggest environmental and public health threat of our time. Poll after poll after poll confirms the vast majority of Americans want leaders to address climate change. It's time to point out the GOP's failure for what it is: out-of-step extremism.It Will be Tough for a Climate Denier to Win the White House: Extensive polling from red and blue and purple states reveals that climate change matters to the majority of voters. And it really matters to three voting blocs that will be key to winning in 2016: women, Latinos, and young people. Voters want a leader in the White House who will confront the big challenges, not ignore their existence.This Is a Marathon, Not a Sprint: Creating major political change requires stamina. The average bill becoming a law takes eight years to get passed, and most bills die well before that. A complex challenge like climate change will demand many bills, policies and technological innovations, but we will keep running until we cross the finish line. I do it because of my faith and because I want to leave the planet in better shape for my children. They deserve it. Our communities and beautiful wild places deserve it. And even our opponents deserve it.See you in Ohio."}, {"title": "Scientists Confirm That Some Spiders Can Pretty Much BASE Jump", "text": "Your worst nightmare has come true: Spiders are falling from the sky.Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Louisville and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute have found that some spiders in the tropical/subtropical genus Selenops leap from treetops and steer through the air to land on neighboring tree trunks -- much like a BASE jumper steering his or her way down a cliff.Selenops is the first genus of spider found to display this behavior, which is evidently does in order to find food and avoid predators. Some insects, like canopy ants, have also been observed doing this.For their research, the scientists collected 59 Selenops spiders from tree trunks in Peru and Panama. Then the researchers dropped the spiders one by one -- always from a height of between 65 and 80 feet, and always within about five feet of a nearby tree trunk -- and observed what happened.An overwhelming majority of these spiders -- 55 out of 59, or about 93 percent -- made what the researchers call a \"direct\" descent toward the tree trunk, meaning they glided toward the trunk in what appeared to be a controlled, deliberate manner and landed successfully on it.What's interesting, according to the findings, is that these spiders \"never attached draglines to the specimen vial during the initial drop, nor was silk ever seen during descent.\" In other words, the spiders were in free fall -- but could still control the direction of their descent, apparently by moving and twitching their legs in midair. (The researchers note that \"each spider was tested only once, as it was not possible to recover individuals post-descent\" -- which, yeah, if someone dropped us from 65 feet off the ground, we wouldn't stick around to let them do it a second time, either.)If it's any comfort, the researchers note that \"other arachnid lineages,\" like scorpions and daddy longlegs, do not exhibit the same controlled gliding behavior, meaning you don't have to worry about scorpions paratrooping through your window at night.The findings were published Wednesday at the Journal of the Royal Society Interface website."}, {"title": "EPA Methane Rule: A Good Start Toward Meeting Administration's Landmark Goal", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a big step this week, announcing the nation's first methane pollution standards for the oil and gas industry. But to understand the impact of these new draft rules, it's important to look at what they do - and what they don't - and measure them against the nation's bold but readily achievable goals set out by the Obama administration earlier this year.The president's target of reducing methane emissions by 40 to 45 percent in the next decade is historic - currently there are no national limits on methane pollution from the oil and gas industry. It's also critical to protecting the climate and public health - methane packs more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe, and is released along with other toxic pollutants.The scale of the problem is massive, with industry releasing more than 7 million tons of methane each year. It could also be even bigger than we realize. A new study published just this week reported unrecorded methane emissions from thousands of facilities in only one part of the supply chain. It concluded gathering facility emissions were eight times higher than estimated, a staggering figure that if included in EPA's inventory would increase current estimates of total industry emissions by 20 percent.So, how does the new proposal measure up? Here is our first take on some of the key elements:A down payment on the nation's goalEDF has always believed that a direct approach is the best approach. So it's great to see that EPA addressed methane head-on. But targeting existing sources of methane pollution will be critical to achieving the nation's reduction goal, and EPA's proposed rules deal largely with methane from new and modified sources, leaving 6.7 million metric tons on the table from infrastructure supporting the 1 million wells already in operation. Taken together, EPA projects these actions will reduce methane by 560 to 620 thousand short tons which, for context, represents about 7 to 8 percent of the total emissions from the oil and gas supply chain in the 2012 Inventory.While the EPA rules are just one of several actions that will help the nation cut methane pollution by 45 percent, they are one of the most important.Additional actions will be needed to meet this goal, including decisive action to tackle the biggest part of the problem--emissions from wells, pipelines, and facilities in operation now. Indeed, over the next few years, 90 percent of emissions will come from existing, not new sources.The proposed standards include a pathway for addressing existing sources in non-attainment areas, through control technique guidelines (CTGs) to get at volatile organic compounds, an ozone precursor. For many of the existing sources covered by CTGs, EPA leverages the same technologies and practices that the agency proposed to apply to new sources in the rest of its rules - demonstrating that we have the technologies to cost-effectively deal with new and existing emission sources. Indeed, states like Colorado and Wyoming have effectively applied standards to reduce oil and gas emissions from existing and new operations based on these technologies, and EPA should follow.Frequent Leak Monitoring is a Priority  We know that leaks are a big source of oil and gas methane emissions and that regular inspection and maintenance can go a long way toward reducing the emissions. It's a good thing that EPA's proposal included leak detection and repair, and that these requirements apply to both well sites and compressor stations across the natural gas supply chain. They also require operators to look for leaks at components and pieces of equipment (like storage tanks) that can be very significant sources of emissions.Frequent monitoring for leaks is critical to mitigating methane emissions, as leaks can emerge anywhere at any time and can be difficult to predict. EPA's proposal included provisions for semi-annual and annual monitoring, and in certain cases, also proposed to allow facilities to reduce the frequency of their monitoring requirements. States like Colorado and Wyoming have recognized that more frequent monitoring is necessary and highly-cost effective to stay on top of emissions. EPA has requested comment on this and it will be important for the final standards to reflect these states' leading practices.Liquids unloading sidelined, for now  Last fall, EPA issued a set of five technical white papers, analyzing the biggest sources of methane and cost-effective technologies capable of reducing those emissions. EPA's new standards address new and modified sources in four of these five categories--equipment leaks, pneumatic devices, compressors, and oil well completions. It took some good steps here, including extending green completions to oil wells, as leading states Colorado and Wyoming have already done. And, these requirements apply across segments--including production, gathering and boosting, processing, and transmission and storage.EPA took comment on, but did not propose to address, the fifth source--liquids unloading, a common maintenance practice operators use to purge liquids that accumulate during production. We know from scientific research that this is a big source of emissions, and states like Colorado have already taken action to address these and standards for liquids unloading will be an important feature of a rigorous final rule.Let's Get Going  The lion's share to the reductions needed can be achieved simply by transforming the best practices already demonstrated by companies in the industry into the standard practices used throughout the industry.Those who have first-hand experience successfully putting these practices to use didn't shy away from sharing their thoughts on the rule. Some of the more responsible companies in the field, who have already seen the benefits of methane reduction efforts, showed support for EPA's action, despite the typical outcry against regulation by many of the usual industry players.And from Colorado, which in 2014 became the first state to directly regulate methane emissions, Governor John Hickenlooper also put his support behind the rule, saying that \"protecting public health and the environment, and promoting our energy industry are not mutually exclusive endeavors.\"It's time to translate this success and support into action - working over the coming months to strengthen EPA's rules so we can put them into practice and start achieving the reductions we need to protect our health, environment and economy.This blog post is cross-posted with EDF's blog, Energy Exchange."}, {"title": "6 Ways Billion-Dollar Businesses Prove You Can Profit And Still Do Good", "text": "For all those doubters in business who believe it’s not possible to combine making money with creating a better world, it’s time to think again.There are now at least nine companies globally, five of them in the United States, which make more than $1 billion in annual revenues from products that have sustainability or social good at the heart of what they do.These are not companies that rely on a committed group of green shoppers to buy their products. Instead, they represent some of the most innovative multinationals on the planet, and their recipe for success can serve as a model for other companies looking to make a difference.Making the list are Tesla’s electric vehicles and Toyota’s Prius, as well as Nike’s Flyknit athletic shoes and GE’s Ecomagination technology, which ranges from power to transportation.Food also features strongly, including Chipotle, which has a focus on naturally raised pork, beef and chicken, Whole Foods Market, the first U.S. national supermarket to have its retail operation certified organic, and Unilever, which aims to source all its agricultural ingredients from sustainable farming.These companies' combined revenues from sustainable products amount to more than $100 billion a year, equivalent to the 62 largest economy in the world.Freya Williams, marketing consultant to Fortune 500 companies, says these firms are not only in many cases growing faster than their competitors, but also commanding wider profit margins.Analysis by the consulting group POINT 380 also shows them to give the best returns to shareholders, challenging the myth that business success relies on profit maximization above all else.If you had put $1,000 into these nine companies in June 2010, your investments would by March of this year have been valued at $3,251, compared with $1,932 for a portfolio of more traditional competitors.Williams suggests that another wave of sustainable companies may soon join the elite group of American businesses that have surpassed the “magic” billion-dollar benchmark. These include Warby Parker, Airbnb, The Honest Company, SweetGreen, Patagonia and Method Home.To put this in perspective, Williams says there is only a 0.00006 percent chance of building a company that breaks the billion-dollar revenue ceiling.“These are not boring, crunchy granola companies or obscure B2B suppliers, “ writes Williams, U.S. CEO of sustainability change agency Futerra, in her new book Green Giants. “They are some of the most vibrant, sexy brands out there today.\"“They aren’t trying to compete with the big boys.

She instantly made the decision that this dog's life would have love and snuggles in it, instead of likely euthanasia.\"There was something about her that just spoke to me. When I get that feeling, I get to work,\" Zanowski told The Huffington Post.She named the pup Dylan, after a beloved dog who'd unexpectedly died late last year, and then deployed her team.The doggie was in an Arizona shelter, so logistics were tricky.One friend got Dylan from the shelter. Another brought her to Sara Dent -- herself a lawyer and pit bull rescuer, living in Arizona -- who tended to Dylan for a few days, while arrangements were made for a dispatch to Washington.At Dent's house, too, Dylan found herself nestled up close with the other animals.For example, here she is with Emma, one of Dent's four dogs.\"She was pretty darn adorable,\" Dent says.\"She is such a snuggle bug.\"Within the week, Dylan's chariot arrived in the form of a volunteer pilot named Lucas Ansley, who came to collect the dog and fly her off to Washington.\"Honestly, I cried like a baby,\" says Dent. \"For purely selfish reasons, as I know she will have an amazing new life in Washington and that she is one of the lucky ones to get out of the shelter. I just knew I would miss her sweetness.\"Then even in the air, this lucky puppy was a charmer.\"As a passenger, Dylan was superb,\" says Ansley -- mostly conking out, until the plane was about to land, then looking out the window and taking notice, \"as if to say, 'Well, hello my new home, you're much greener than Arizona.'\"On top of being greener, Dylan's new home has more playmates of a variety of species: children, horses, dogs.And of course there's the cat.His name is Indie, and he's an 11-year Siamese rescue with a stylish wardrobe (Indie doesn't have much fur so the clothes keep him warm) who belongs to Tough Love volunteer Olivia Bradley.Bradley has been looking after Dylan, while she gets a little more socialized, some obedience training and a few more cuddles from the cat.\"Indie and Dylan have snuggled every night and will share the occasional cat nap in a sun spot,\" says Bradley. \"Indie is quite smitten with little Dylan.\"Dylan will stay in foster care for a while, until her skin is all healed up and her social skills are unimpeachable.After that, she'll be made available for adoption -- hopefully, to be taken in by a family who has a willing cat or two (or three or four).And Zanowski will be looking out for the next dog who needs her. Her hope is that each rescued dog will serve as a model, who shows the world that shelter pets are loving, and good, and deserving.\"I believe in redemption,\" Zanowski says. \"We can all do something to solve the problems we see in the world.

UNESCO just did, by including the fabled Texas mission in its  latest designated places of \"outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.\"At the same time, a less publicized UNESCO decision, made by the international body's World Heritage Committee, could have an equally profound and more global impact. UNESCO's rules now recognize Indigenous people as a unique group with distinct rights and require that the \"free, prior, and informed consent\" of affected Indigenous peoples be obtained during the World Heritage Site nomination process.Why is this rule change so important? For one thing, it affirms and respects the contribution of Indigenous peoples to our common heritage, a long-overdue recognition.But it also underscores another reality: Across some of the world's largest and most ecologically important landscapes--including Australia's Outback and North America's boreal forest--Indigenous peoples are taking the lead in preserving nature as well as their cultures.Since 1998, Australia has created 67 Indigenous Protected Areas covering more than 145 million acres--an area larger than California. More than 700 Indigenous Rangers now work for the Australian government, managing the areas using both their traditional knowledge and Western science to protect biodiversity and limit environmental threats. Their work includes using controlled fires to reduce non-native grasses and weeds that compete with native vegetation, and hunting to control feral animals that kill and compete with Australia's unique wildlife.In Canada, Indigenous communities are showing similar leadership. In the Northwest Territories, the Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation is negotiating to manage Thaidene Nene, a region that includes a proposed national park reserve and two territorial protected areas along Great Slave Lake covering 6.4 million acres. The Deline First Nation is asking UNESCO to declare the watershed around Great Bear Lake, North America's fourth largest, as a World Biosphere Reserve, a designation recognizing special areas that show a balance between humans and nature. Other examples abound.One area of particular interest is Pimachiowin Aki, an 8.25-million-acre area of boreal forest east of Lake Winnipeg. For more than a decade, five First Nations communities in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario have been at the forefront of efforts to protect Pimachiowin Aki, a wilderness rich in biodiversity--home to more than 40 species of native mammals, including wolverines, moose, beavers, and timber wolves--that provides vital habitat for threatened woodland caribou populations and at least eight at-risk bird species.Pimachiowin Aki, which means \"The Land That Gives Life\" in the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) language, has an equally important cultural significance to the local Indigenous peoples. Directed by stories told by elders about their ancestors' lives, archeologists have discovered ancient hunting and cooking tools, camps, and burial sites, as well as pictographs on rock faces. Many traditional practices of the past continue today, part of the unbroken chain of Indigenous peoples' life on the land, dating back many thousands of years.UNESCO is now weighing whether to add Pimachiowin Aki to the World Heritage List as a site of outstanding natural and cultural value. The case for designation is strong, but even with the agency's new language about Indigenous peoples, there's a problem. According to the World Heritage Committee's rigid rules, proposed World Heritage Sites that have both outstanding cultural and natural values need two separate nominations and are evaluated under two entirely separate processes. Indigenous communities, for whom nature and culture are inseparably linked, are stymied by such an approach.This artificial separation has held up designation of Pimachiowin Aki. The World Heritage Committee deferred a decision in 2013 amid an internal debate over whether it needed to revise its processes to accurately evaluate, according to committee documents, \"how the indissoluble bonds that exist in some places between culture and nature can be recognized on the World Heritage List.\" Thankfully, the committee has been working since then to revise its approach, and a decision on a revised Pimachiowin Aki nomination may come in 2016.Sophia Rabliauskas of the Poplar River First Nation, a longtime advocate for Pimachiowin Aki and an attendee at the recent UNESCO meetings, says, \"Right from the beginning, the purpose of the project has been to protect the connection between the land and the people and to share it with the world.\" She adds, \"It's been suggested that we separate the two, but they are inseparable for us. There is no distinction. We are the land.\"By adopting new rules on the rights of Indigenous peoples within the World Heritage process--and by working to integrate the review of natural and cultural values in its evaluations--UNESCO has taken important steps in the right direction, which the people of Pimachiowin Aki hope will improve the ability of Indigenous peoples around the world to protect, share, and pass along their heritage.Now, UNESCO has a chance to take the next step. Listing Pimachiowin Aki as a place just as important to humanity as the Alamo or any other World Heritage Site would honor the contribution of Indigenous peoples to the preservation of both unspoiled nature and their irreplaceable cultures. Let's hope UNESCO's World Heritage Committee agrees and further amends its rules to properly--and fully--designate such special places."}, {"title": "Tired Of City-Life Stresses, Many Chinese Return To Farming", "text": "For many rural Chinese, the dream is to live in a big city.

The gruesome phenomenon has sparked serious concerns that toxic chemicals from the blast site -- a warehouse that stored at least 2,500 tons of hazardous chemicals -- have leaked into the river.Chinese officials, however, have denied that the fish deaths are linked to the blasts.Military teams are reportedly “still struggling to decontaminate” the blast site more than a week after the explosions, The Guardian reports.Wastewater runoff near the site of the explosions have been found to contain hundreds of times as much sodium cyanide than is considered “safe.” Sodium cyanide is extremely toxic to humans, even in very small quantities.Chinese authorities, however, have insisted that water samples taken from the river where the dead fish were found on Thursday did not contain toxic levels of cyanide. The fish were found about four miles from the blast site.Deng Xiaowen, head of Tianjin’s environment monitoring center, said the agency would launch an investigation into the fish deaths. He maintained, however, that “it was not uncommon for fish to die en masse in local rivers during summer, due to poor water quality,” per The Guardian.Despite such assurances, residents of the area have expressed skepticism.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Wang Lei, a 47-year-old man at the river banks Thursday, told the New York Times. “There has to be a link between the dead fish and the blast. What else could explain the death of so many?”At least 114 people were killed and hundreds of others were injured in last week’s explosions, which were so powerful that “cars melted and homes crumbled.” According to ABC News, 70 people are still missing.As residents continue to demand answers and compensation for their damaged property, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to thoroughly investigate the disaster.“The incident has caused heavy casualties and property loss,” he said at a Politburo meeting Thursday, per the New York Times. “It was a profound lesson paid with blood.”Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Whales Are Mysteriously Dying In Alaska", "text": "Whales are turning up dead along the Alaska coast in alarming numbers, and scientists so far have no idea what's causing it.Since May, 30 whales have been found dead along the coast, causing the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to declare and \"unusual mortality event\" on Thursday.So far, the toll includes 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale, and four unidentified cetaceans, according to the agency.That compares to just five dead whales in all of last year.\"NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are very concerned about the large number of whales stranding in the western Gulf of Alaska in recent months,\" Dr. Teri Rowles, NOAA Fisheries' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator, said in a news release.Rowles added:\"While we do not yet know the cause of these strandings, our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live. Members of the public can greatly assist the investigation by immediately reporting any sightings of dead whales or distressed live animals they discover.So far, scientists have been able to reach just one of the 30 whale carcasses.\"Alaska has an awful lot of coastline and much of it is difficult to reach,\" NOAA adviser Dr. Bree Witteveen told CBC. \"We can't get to those carcasses more often than not.\"The broadcaster said an additional six dead whales have turned up along the coast of British Columbia, and Canadian authorities are working closely with NOAA.One theory is that a toxic algae bloom, created by warmer-than-usual waters off the West Coast, could be playing a role.“That always concerns us because that means there’s probably a change in overall pathogen exposure, possibly harmful algal blooms and other factors,” Rowles said in news conference on Thursday, according to Alaska Dispatch News.So far, one sample tested negative for a type of toxin produced by algae, but the carcass was so decomposed that it may not be reliable, the Dispatch News reported.The agency also said in an online FAQ that it's \"highly unlikely\" that radiation from Fukushima is playing a role, but that further testing is under way.NOAA said it may take months or years before scientists know for sure what's causing the deaths.It's the first unusual mortality event for whales ever in Alaska, and just the third of any kind in the state. The agency had previously declared such events for pinnipeds in 2011 and sea otters in 2006.The agency has released a map showing where the carcasses have been spotted, with a number of them concentrated in the Kodiak area.NOAA asks that anyone who spots a dead whale or a living distressed whale call the Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 877-925-7773, or contact the U.S. Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16.The agency is also asking that the public not approach or touch the whale.Updates will be posted on a website set up for the unusual mortality event."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - August 20, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Fox 'News' finally finds reason to 'care' about the environment; Hillary Clinton draws a bright green line around Arctic drilling; EPA tells oil and gas industry to cut the methane; Islamic leaders call on Muslims worldwide to act on climate change; PLUS: Water contamination in America's rivers and streams is creating intersex fish...

Using a small vial of orange experimental pollen that looked like Kool-Aid, I dusted my right index finger and, from a ladder in apricot tree #32a, set about touching the pistils of every flower I could reach.Not a bad summer job for an 18-year-old: fertilizing the female organs of hundreds of apricot flowers in a sunny orchard, listening to Grateful Dead tapes via speakers set on top of my lime-green Chevy Nova.Sugar Magnolia, blossom's bloomin'...head's all empty and I don't care.Saw my baby down by the river, knew she had to come up soon for air.Now, many years after that summer of love, I got hives.I'm a first-year beekeeper. My teenagers call me The Beek--as in Bee Geek. And I have to agree, it's impossible to look cool in a white full-length bee suit and veil.But I don't care. I started this hobby to help honeybees. You've heard about colony collapse disorder? Since 2009, beekeepers have been puzzled by the wide-scale deaths of hives that occur in winter. Worker bees abandon the hive, leaving the queen and honey stores. It's a worrisome mystery. Honeybees, I've learned, are responsible for every third bite of food we take. No honeybees? No blueberries, no cauliflower, no apples or melons, no pumpkins or grapes. No wine. The list goes on.I felt compelled to try to help out in a small way. So I took a beekeeping class at a junior college along with about 100 other folks from all walks of life who were similarly motivated.I felt giddy with anticipation (and a little fear) driving home on April 10 with a box of 5,000 buzzing Italian honeybees (and one queen) in my backseat--sort of like a dad carefully driving his first newborn home from the hospital. What I didn't realize at the time was how much trying to help bees would end up helping me.Show Me the HoneyThe honeybees are living at the corner of an organic farm field across the street from my home in a pinewood hive I built from a kit. The swarm took to the hive quickly, drawing out wax comb on the frames of the boxes, and the queen began filling the cells with eggs. I've read that a good queen can lay about 1,500 eggs per day. I must have been blessed with a good queen. It's the end of August and I estimate there are close to 70,000 bees in the colony. The hive is now four boxes high, the top two heavy with honey.I won't harvest this first year--the bees need 60 to 80 pounds of honey for food to survive the winter. (That's the big goal--avoid colony collapse and get 'em into next spring.) But that's fine with me. The bees have given me much more than I'll ever take.Like any hobby--gardening, woodworking, running, fly-fishing--beekeeping is a welcome distraction from the drone of modern life. It's impossible to focus on the stresses of work, managing a home, and worrying about college applications and aging parents when your head is inside a hive of 70,000 ornery stingers that think you're a black bear trying to steal their golden treasure.It Must Have Been the RosesIn the early mornings or evenings, I enjoy walking down the dirt road, past the organic farm field, the wildflowers, and sweet clover to the apiary at the edge of the woods. I'll check on the bees' progress and feed them sugar water mixed with a shot of Honey B Healthy vitamins. Sometimes, I'll just sit on a stump nearby and watch the foragers fly in and out of the hive. \"It's like Newark airport,\" one of my visitors observed recently.Some workers fly straight out rising high above the trees. Others curve left around the honeysuckles toward the field of clover or maybe to the large ring of lavender about half mile to the east. Honeybees can travel 3 to 5 miles in search of nectar. When they find the bounty, they don't selfishly keep it a secret. Rather, they hustle back home to tell their sisters, communicating the directions through an enthusiastic waggle dance. I'm amazed that they can navigate back to a 24-inch hive entrance from a distance of 5 miles, while I still get lost using a GPS.A worker, which is a female bee, lives only 4 to 6 weeks in the summer, so those foragers I'm watching will never taste the honey they are storing for winter. They will be long dead. They are doing this work for their yet-to-emerge sisters and brothers--for the health of the colony. I'm in awe of their dedication to task and the community. A honeybee hive is pure buzzing socialism.I've witnessed the bees defend the colony against intruders, such as hive beetles, robber bees from other hives, yellow jacket wasps, and me. When a bee stings, it's a suicide act because it dies immediately after delivering its weapon into the flesh of its foe, the barbed stinger literally yanking its entrails out of its body as the bee flies away.Man, bees have a tough life. Bears destroy their hives; skunks love to eat them; parasites like the varroa destructor and tracheal mites suck their blood. And we humans are making it even tougher on them. Scientists don't know exactly what's causing the winter colony collapse. Supposed culprits include lack of habitat and availability of diverse sources of pollen and nectar, global warming, viruses, parasites, genetically modified crops, pesticides containing neonicotinoids, even the practice of trucking beehives to farmers' fields and orchards. Who knows the cause? Many experts believe it's a combo deal: the result of a cocktail of insults small and large. The good news is that bees are, in many ways, smarter than us humans. (They've been around for 40 million years!) And each spring they reproduce rapidly. Still, the bees could use our help, and there are some simple things you can do that, even if they don't impact collapse disorder, make sense for the pollinators and their planet.Buzz WorthyAugust 22 is National Honey Bee Day, a great opportunity to learn more about these social insects. Visit a local apiary, buy organic fruits and vegetables for your garden, plant large areas of native plants to create more diverse habitat, and teach a kid that insects like bees are not to be feared but are essential for a healthy Earth. To find Honey Bee Day activities, check with your local beekeepers association. Who knows, if you become intrigued (and I know you will), you might consider becoming a backyard beekeeper. Spread the honey!Eastern Pennsylvania note: If you happen to live nearby Rodale Inc's home office, there will be a day of free bee activity, including an observation hive, at the Pool Wildlife Sanctuary in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. The event is sponsored by the Lehigh Valley Beekeepers Association.Jeff Csatari is executive editor of Men's Health and Women's Health books.Jeff's father, illustrator Joseph Csatari, drew the honeybee sketch.

Photo by Brendon Purdy.After decades of uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions and mounting impacts, we now need an \"all hands on deck\" cooperative approach to develop workable, long-term solutions to climate change. This presents an opportunity for elders and youngers to collaborate, to bridge what climate scientist and \"father of global warming\" James Hansen calls the \"geezer-young person gap.\"Pope Francis writes in his May 2015 encyclical letter \"On Care for Our Common Home\" that \"Each community ... has the duty to protect the earth and to ensure its fruitfulness for coming generations....\" \"We can no longer speak of sustainable development apart from intergenerational solidarity,\" he observes. \"Intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us.\"What Geezer-Young Person Gap?With the Industrial Revolution, the number of generations at many western dinner tables shrank from three to two, with grandparents living elsewhere. The Baby Boom following World War II -- combined with an increase in average life expectancy -- has created growing numbers of retirees. Baby boomers began reaching age 65 in 2011 at the rate of 10,000 people every day in the U.S. Many elders feel cut off from the rest of western society, which considers them to be finished contributing and tends to exclude and think negatively of them.Likewise, many young people are increasingly \"siloed\" - more often with their peers than at the family dinner table, only occasionally with grandparents, and communicating remotely over the internet. Some feel anxiety and dread about climate change.What Elders and Youngers BringElders constitute a huge, untapped resource -- a large number of people with relatively abundant assets. Compared with youngers, many elders have more free time, financial resources, experience, economic and political clout, and sense of connection to nature. They have witnessed environmental changes in ways youngers have not. Because they have observed repeated historical upheavals in their lifetime, many elders take a long view. Aware they may have few years left, elders often work with a sense of urgency and willingness to take bold action.Youngers likewise constitute a huge, untapped resource. It is primarily they who will steer humanity onto a sustainable course. Youngers around the world -- fearing a long future of climate change impacts -- are taking action. Among other assets, they bring energy, idealism, eagerness to learn and grow, and proficiency with social media and the Internet. They provide \"boots on the ground\" at marches, rallies, and other events.Elders and youngers both benefit from collaboration. Youngers appreciate that elders will listen to them, hear them, and back them up. With their encouragement, youngers may be more inclined to practice, test themselves, and lead. In past decades, elders created massive change in the environmental, civil rights, women's rights, and antiwar movements. Now elders groups around the world are taking action on climate change. Youngers can learn from their experiences. Elders benefit by gaining a sense of purpose and contribution, as well as the gratification that their knowledge and skills are valued by youngers. Elders are inspired by the commitment and curiosity of youngers and appreciate their assistance with social media tools and the Internet.While elders and youngers attend events together -- for example, the People's Climate March last September and 350.org workshops -- several non-profit organizations have an explicit mission to bring adults and children together in intergenerational action on climate change.The Norwegian Grandparents Climate Change Campaign (NGCC)NGCC partners with youngers -- for example Miljøagentene The Eco-Agents, an environmental organization for Norwegian children -- to push for climate-protecting policies. Elders and youngers together write letters to government officials, speak to the Parliament, demonstrate in front of the Norwegian Parliament building, meet in schools, attend rallies and marches, and educate the public. NGCC and The Eco-Agents jointly produced a four-page pamphlet that they have distributed to members of Parliament and secondary school students and public libraries across Norway. NGCC and kindergarten children recently protested the climate-damaging draining and excavation of a peat bog located on public property.NGCC, in cooperation with the Norwegian Climate Network, is organizing a train tour of elders and youngers from Oslo to Paris this December for the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). Many organizations are invited to join, among them Nature and Youth. NGCC and youngers will also hold demonstrations in Norway during the COP21 negotiations.Suzuki EldersSuzuki Elders -- a voluntary association of about 100 elders in Canada working with and through the David Suzuki Foundation -- strives to \"mentor, encourage, and support other elders and the younger generations in dialogue and action in the environment.\" The group's intergenerational activities in recent years have included an \"Elders, Environment, and Youth Forum,\" with David Suzuki, his daughter, and his grandson presenting; participation in marches, rallies, conferences, and workshops; creation of an informational video; improvement of social media platforms; retreats on the theme \"Elders and Youth -- Listening to Each Other\"; and workshops on intergenerational storytelling.Suzuki Elders coaches elders to work effectively with youngers. Their tips include going to where youngers are (e.g., public events and social media sites); connecting firmly with one or two who are eager to work with elders; scheduling events for times that work for youngers; providing refreshments; respecting youngers' social media prowess; supporting them without criticizing, directing, teaching, or holding expectations; listening; being patient; and understanding that youngers are busy with school and other activities.No Planeta BNo Planeta B, a nonprofit organization of adults in Peru and the U.S., launched the Cut the Red Tape Project to involve students, parents, and schools in climate change action. Participating schools sign a declaration committing to at least five climate change-mitigation actions, such as going paperless and having meatless Mondays. So far, schools in in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Curaçao, Guyana, Argentina, and the U.S. have signed on. Similarly, parents are invited to sign a declaration committing to at least five actions, such as reducing food waste and walking and bicycling more often. Participants are also circulating a petition calling for strong action at the COP21.According to Executive Director Yoca Arditi-Rocha, No Planeta B will bring together delegations of students, teachers, and school administrators at conferences this fall. Three will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong, and San Francisco in conjunction with Global Issues Network, and one will be held in Miami in conjunction with Climate Reality Project, headed by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.Also planned are a video contest and rallies in schools in at least 10 countries. In December, No Planeta B plans to hold a one-day conference at COP21, which will be attended by delegations of students and adults from Peru, China, the U.S., and other countries. There, No Planeta B will present the declarations and petition to the U.N.Coming TogetherOur prospects for developing effective climate change solutions will improve if elders and youngers increase collaboration and find new ways to combine their talents, skills, and energy. On an international level, elders and youngers can attend COP21 together. On a national level, elders and youngers can participate in the upcoming Grandparents Climate Action Day in Washington, D.C. on September 9 and 10. On a local level, youngers and elders can connect -- through schools, non-profits, clubs, retirement communities, or senior centers -- to learn about climate change and press for solutions. Students and alums can continue pressuring colleges and universities to divest their fossil fuel stock holdings.Elders and youngers working together can not only meet the epic challenge of climate change but also heal age divisions in western societies.

When the shelter's cruelty investigators arrived, they found the animal in awful shape.“She looks pretty horrific,” Houghton told BuzzFeed News. “Her entire head is burnt. There isn’t any skin untouched. Her eyes are burnt. She’s lost all of one ear that was essentially melted off.”The pooch, who was named Rosie, was brought back to the shelter and it was later determined that hydrochloric acid had been thrown on her face, Houghton told HuffPost. Thankfully, Rosie is now on the road to recovery and has been receiving the medical care and TLC that she's always deserved.The pup has even begun to show positive changes in mood.\"The first few days that she was here, she appeared really glum. It was pretty clear she didn't know ... what had happened to her, where she was,\" Lisa Norwood, public relations and outreach manager, told HuffPost. \"[Wednesday], we went in to check on her and we found her wagging her tail. [The day] was filled with tail-wagging and kisses.\"Rosie came to the shelter with a host of health issues.She was underweight and most of the hair on her face had been burned off. The pup, who is also heartworm positive, is blind because of the burns. Her injuries indicate that she likely went weeks without any type of medical care. Houghton hopes the blindness will be temporary, as next week the pup is set to undergo surgery that could potentially restore her vision.Rosie has been making strides though, and gaining weight as well. The animal, who Norwood describes as \"gentle and sweet,\" has a long way to go before she's completely healthy and will need to spend some time rehabilitating. When she's healthy enough, she'll be up for adoption and ready to find a forever home.\"Our greatest hope for her is that she can heal and she can find a happy home,\" Norwood told HuffPost.An investigation regarding Rosie's abuse is currently underway, according to Norwood.To learn more about Rosie, or the San Antonio Animal Care Services Department, visit their Facebook page here.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Most Voters Don't Care About Hillary Clinton's Email", "text": "This past Tuesday I turned on CNN and watched a conservative political pundit go off the rails when she stated that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server was somehow connected to Monica Lewinsky. In that moment I knew Republicans and the blatantly anti-Hillary media had overplayed their hand, as most voters simply don't give a horses' ass about Hillary's email, but instead care deeply about the following four issues that the carnival barkers rarely seem to discuss.   ECONOMIC ACCESS It's no secret that from the purplish Regan-Democrats to the azure blue Warren-Progressives to the ruby red-Republicans to the colorless independents, voters are worried about the shrinking middle class. No issue strikes closer to the heart of the electorate's concerns than the fact that the rich in this country keep getting richer while the rest of us are left scrambling to keep our heads above the water. Instead of endlessly bickering about what information was classified then versus now, why doesn't the news focus on the lives of real Americans that are either looking for work, working more than one job while trying to make ends meet, or holding full-time jobs that have left them far away from achieving the American dream?COLLGE AFFORDABILITY It used to be that you went to college and that led to a better paying job, which in turn brought you home-ownership and a brighter future. However, today many students leave school saddled with extreme debt and little else. While they may eventually be able to get that higher-paying job, the cost of their student loan payments are so astronomical that although the higher salary looks good on paper, they are defaulting on their loans at record rates and would have been better off going directly into the work force than college. I for one would love to see less media scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's Snapchat joke and much more scrutiny of Sallie Mae and the despicable laws that allow for billionaires in our country, like Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, to go bankrupt multiple times and keep their properties, cars, furs, and cash, while the average Joe can't even cancel student loan debt through bankruptcy.RACE, GENDER, AND SEXUAL EQUALITY People across our nation face discrimination every day. African-Americans are being unfairly targeted and often killed in our streets, immigrants live frightened in the shadows of every city across our land, transgender people are attacked and murdered at alarming rates with little outcry from the public, and women are still paid less than men in the workforce. Yet, somehow every time you turn on the television or open up a laptop, the leading headline is about whether or not Hillary was angry when reporters asked her about her server. When video surfaced this week of Hillary pushing the organizers of #BlackLivesMatter to think about what laws and systems they want to change through their important civil rights movement, there was barely a blip of media coverage. Yet that same day countless hours were spent dissecting Mrs. Clinton's off the cuff remark about cleaning her server with a cloth. a clue people...there are far more important matters!ENVIRONMENT Finally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported today that this past July had the highest average temperatures since they began keeping records. The polar ice caps are melting, California is burning, and extreme weather is becoming the norm. We should be in full-fledged panic mode over the viability of our planet due to global warming and its effect on our environment. Yet, on the FoxNews website, one can't even find a mention of this crisis, but rest assured Hillary's email is front and center. Voters want to hear from our candidates about what they are going to do to save mankind from ourselves, not if the GOP-led congress has opened yet another political probe into Hillary.The era of endless breaking news and constant political witch hunts is not going away any time soon, but media beware, voters are sick of being told what to think and want to hear about issues that actually matter. One need only look at how many Trump obituaries political pundits have had to eat like their hats in the past few months to see that the same holds true for the non-existent but overly exploited Hillary email scandal. No matter how much the talking heads and windbags pontificate on the demise of Hillary Clinton because of these stupid emails, we the people are not interested. Stop focusing all of your attention on partisan garbage and focus instead on the things that directly affect the voting population."}, {"title": "'Skeleton' Tigers Forced To Perform For Entertainment", "text": "Thousands of people flooded to the Missouri State Fair this week to get a glimpse of one of the main attractions: a group of performing tigers.

This exceeds the number of people who die from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis -- combined. A Bhutanese and Danish-based group hopes to solve this problem by using existing technology to provide a combination of fuel cookies and smokeless stoves.They are described as \"the forgotten 3 billion\" by WHO. These forgotten 3 billion make up nearly half the world's population and still cook their food on open fires using firewood, coal and animal dung as their fuel. Doing so is not harmless. On the contrary, they are being exposed to high levels of household air pollution that cause a number of diseases ranging from pneumonia to strokes and lung cancer.Women are mostly tasked with the day to day cooking and while spending hours in front of the fires, stirring their pots and keeping a watchful eye on their children, they breathe in the toxic smoke. It is not surprising then that most of the 4.3 million deaths that happen per year are women and children in low- and middle-income countries.The solution to this fatal problem is something as simple as a stove. Smokeless stoves will not only make it safer for people to cook but also help the environment by eliminating black carbon emissions. Stoves alone are however not a long-term solution. People living below poverty line are unable to cope with the high costs for purchase and maintenance of stoves. Therefore, providing a long-term affordable and cleaner alternative is crucial. Household air pollution is not just a threat to the people in front of the fire - it affects all of us. Burning biomass on open fires releases a huge amount of carbon and black carbon, which contributes to global climate change.In the Kingdom of Bhutan alone, a small country located in the Himalayas, 70 percent of households use firewood and other forestry waste for cooking, exposing them to the harmful smoke on a daily basis. The cooperative organization Dazin, based in Bhutan and Denmark, seeks to eliminate household air pollution by their inclusive model of fuel + stove solution. Rural people in Bhutan gives their wood waste to Dazin, instead of burning it in an open fire. This crowdsourced wood waste is made into condensed fuel 'cookie' -- small and efficient briquettes. The rural households get back smokeless cookstove on lease and enough fuel cookies to cover their needs. The surplus fuel made from their crowdsourced wood waste due to the efficiency of Fuel + Stove solution, is sold at a competitive price to urban customers (restaurants, households, schools, etc.) ensuring economic sustainability and further development.Dazin's crowdfunding campaign aims to raise $40.000 by Sunday September the 6th. The funding will initially benefit 2000 people in Bhutan with stoves and fuel cookies in the upcoming winter. Dazin seeks to replicate the concept in other areas and reduce carbon emissions from residential fuel usage.Let's Cook Up a Better Future and give rural communities access to a sustainable fuel source and a smokeless gasifying stove! Dazin believes that people, planet and profit can combine to make positive change.

The real problem for New Orleans and all of coastal Louisiana is that the first line of defense--the wetlands that naturally buffer the impact of waves and wind--are disappearing at the shocking rate of one football field an hour.Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles of land. That's an area the size of Delaware just gone, entire communities wiped off the map.The shrinking wetlands also reduce protections for coastal residents, local economies, national industries, and wildlife habitats. We saw this as Louisiana was pummeled by back-to-back hurricanes with Hurricane Rita slamming Southwest Louisiana just four weeks after the eastern side of the state took the hit from Katrina.And this is not just a Louisiana problem. Wetlands are vanishing throughout coastal America under the pressure of development and urbanization and sea-level rise with similarly devastating results: Witness Hurricane Sandy's impact on the New York City area in 2012 and the storms that regularly wipe out Florida's shoreline communities.Who's to blame?In Louisiana's case, the extensive wetlands that once spanned the Louisiana Gulf Coast have been sliced up by oil pipelines and navigation canals. These man-made cuts and channels have allowed salt water to penetrate deep into wetlands, killing the native grasses, trees, and other plants that hold the soils together.So what can we do about it?As it turns out, plenty. There are strong, science-based methods for repairing and bringing back protective coastal wetlands.One of the best solutions is reconnecting the Mississippi River with its delta. The river has been straitjacketed by levees that prevent its sediment from replenishing the wetlands. Instead, it pushes precious amounts of sediment deep into the Gulf of Mexico, far beyond where it can do any good.Audubon has been experimenting with using dredges to build marsh in depleted wetlands. Within a matter of months, the marsh grasses and other plants spring to life and start spreading. And important waterbirds, such as Black-necked Stilts, Greater Yellowlegs, and Tricolored Herons, and marsh birds, such as King Rails, Seaside Sparrows, and Marsh Wrens, start returning.If we know how to fix the problem, why isn't more being done?Money. And political commitment.Louisiana officials estimate it will cost tens of billions of dollars over the next 50 years to restore and preserve the coast and reduce risk for coastal communities. To do it right we need to take on major projects that go to the root of the problem. Band-Aid fixes are not going to work.We have a historic chance for a running start with the proposed settlement with BP for $18.7 billion in penalties for the environmental damages caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil gusher. Louisiana's share is estimated to be up to $8.7 billion dollars.The challenge will be making sure every cent of that money goes to coastal restoration and isn't diverted to other state needs.But the BP money is just a start. Doing the job right will require state and national leadership to fully fund key projects that will result in large-scale restoration. It will also mean protecting the existing federal dollars dedicated to coastal restoration and finding new funding in the future.Why should the rest of the country care what happens on the Louisiana coast?To be sure New Orleans is one of the great cultural and culinary destinations of the United States. And the Gulf Coast is an ecological treasure: Nearly half of North America's bird species use it as a resting or refueling stop at some point in their migrations.But the Louisiana and the Gulf Coast are also powerful economic engines for shipping, energy, and other industries that support millions of jobs across America.If there's one thing we all learned from Katrina, it's that we waited too long. We have to invest in serious restoration of our coasts now.

The administration's goal is to cut methane emissions 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA expects to release its final methane rules next year, after it hears public comments.\"Today, through our cost-effective proposed standards, we are underscoring our commitment to reducing the pollution fueling climate change and protecting public health while supporting responsible energy development, transparency and accountability,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a statement. \"Cleaner-burning energy sources like natural gas are key compliance options for our Clean Power Plan and we are committed to ensuring safe and responsible production that supports a robust clean energy economy.\"The rules target new and modified oil and natural gas operations, but as Greenwire reports, they could eventually trigger regulation of methane leakage from the entire sector (subscription). The proposed rules call for oil and gas processing and transmission facilities to locate and repair methane leaks, capture natural gas from hydraulically fractured oil wells and limit emissions from equipment -- actions netting climate benefits of $120 to $150 million in 2025, according to the EPA.As they are now, the proposed rules could achieve a cut of 25 to 30 percent by 2025, according to Janet McCabe, acting assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation. To meet the full 40-45 percent goal, the administration expects to rely on voluntary efforts, state regulations and a Department of the Interior rule covering drilling on public lands.The rules supplement recently announced voluntary initiatives to address methane emissions at existing wells -- emissions that may be greater than the EPA estimates according to new research.A study conducted by scientists at Colorado State University and published in Environmental Science & Technology, quantifies emissions from thousands of gathering facilities, which consolidate gas from wells and feed it into processing plants or pipelines. These emissions have been largely unreflected in federal statistics, the report says, but may be the largest methane source in the oil and gas supply chain. These newly identified emissions would increase total emissions from that chain in EPA's current Greenhouse Gas Inventory by approximately 25 percent.Climate Action DeclarationMuslim scholars from 20 countries issued an \"Islamic Declaration on Climate Change\" on Tuesday, calling on the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to work to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to commit to renewable energy sources.The declaration drawing on Islamic teachings and to be presented at the global climate summit in Paris was finalized at the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium in Istanbul this week.\"The pace of global climate change today is of a different order of magnitude from the gradual changes that previously occurred throughout the most recent era, the Cenozoic,\" the declaration reads. \"Moreover, it is human-induced: we have now become a force dominating nature. Our species, though selected to be a caretaker or steward on the earth, has been the cause of such corruption and devastation on it that we are in danger [of] ending life as we know it on our planet.\"The declaration asks Muslim countries, particularly those that are \"well-off\" and \"oil-producing,\" to lead the greenhouse gas phase out and to provide financial and technical support for climate change efforts by less-affluent states.Alaska and Climate ChangeClimate change could exacerbate one of Alaska's worst wildfire seasons -- one that has burned some 5 million acres of tundra and forests and ignited fears that large stores of carbon are being emitted into the atmosphere.\"We really need to start considering the long-term implications of big fires that are being predicted,\" said Nicky Sundt, a climate change expert for the World Wildlife Fund. \"In the Arctic, you have a lot of carbon locked up, and the fires will release that. We need to start thinking seriously about the carbon emissions from these fires.\"A recent Climate Central analysis shows that in the last 60 years large wildfires in Alaska have essentially doubled and that the wildfire season is 40 percent (35 days) longer than it was in the 1950s, mainly due to rapid warming in the globe's northern reaches.\"The primary driver is temperature. The warmer we get, the more fires we seem to get,\" Mike Flannigan, a wildland fire expert at the University of Alberta, said. \"We need a 15 percent increase in precipitation to account for the warming. Very few climate models suggest there will be an increase in precipitation to compensate for the increase in temperature. The fuels will be drier in the future and it will be easy to start the spread of fire.\"Of particular concern -- drying of peat, which then becomes susceptible to burning and release of centuries' worth of carbon in the span of a few hours of intense fire. Teresa Hollingsworth, a researcher and ecology professor with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told NPR that many of the state's fires burned seven feet deep, where vast amounts of carbon are stored.\"The carbon released from fire emissions during a large fire year in Alaska is roughly equivalent to 1 percent of the global fossil fuel and land use emissions,\" said Dave McGuire, a research scientist and leader of the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, in a recent press release.Obama is visiting the state at the end of this month to highlight climate change impacts that go beyond fires.\"In Alaska, glaciers are melting,\" Obama said in a video released last week. \"The hunting and fishing upon which generations have depended for their way of life and for their jobs are being threatened. Storm surges once held at bay now endanger entire villages. As Alaskan permafrost melts, some homes are even sinking into the ground. The state's God-given natural treasures are all at risk.\"The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each Thursday by Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions."}, {"title": "Toxic Chemicals Taint The 'Best Possible' Food For Babies", "text": "Nature created the perfect food for a growing baby. A mother's breast milk is chock full of the essential vitamins, fats, proteins and carbohydrates needed to best build the brain, fight infection and resist chronic disease. But as new research published on Thursday reminds us, a mother's milk today also contains a cocktail of industrial chemicals.\"It's really an absurd situation that women who are breastfeeding have to think about what chemical exposures they might contribute to their child,\" said Philippe Grandjean, an environmental health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and author of the study. \"Breast milk is supposed to be the best possible nutrition for the infant.\"And it still is, Grandjean and other experts emphasize. It's just less pure and healthy than nature intended -- and than we previously believed. Researchers have already found that a number of fat-loving chemicals can hitch rides into newborns via breast milk. Flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, such as DDT, are just some of the known pollutants.In the new study, Grandjean and his team tested the blood of 81 children born in the Faroe Islands between 1997 and 2000 for a class of chemicals that don't have the same affinity for fat: perfluorinated alkylate substances, or PFASs. For every month that a mom exclusively breastfed, they found her baby's blood levels of these common water- and stain-proofing chemicals increased by an average of 20 to 30 percent. Partial breastfeeding led to lower increases.Researchers discovered that the children's levels of PFASs exceeded those Grandjean's previous research had deemed safe. That research found that higher exposure to PFASs can make childhood vaccinations less effective. The chemicals are also suspected of causing cancer and disrupting normal hormone functions, noted Grandjean.You probably know PFASs as the stuff that protects your carpet from stains, keeps your food from sticking to packaging or pans, repels rain from your coat and prevents mascara from running down your cheeks. It likely even lines the waxy paper that held your morning pastry.And your body has likely been acquainted with the chemicals since you were in the womb, or drinking breast milk. \"These compounds stay in your body for years and years,\" said Grandjean.He suggested that the new findings surprised him. How did these chemicals, as pervasive and long-lasting as they are, get into milk in such high quantities? In addition to having a high fat content, breast milk is also packed with protein. So protein may offer chemicals a similar \"ride into the milk,\" Grandjean explained. Unfortunately, this implies that other, previously unsuspected toxins may also be contaminating breast milk.\"We happened to find this for perfluorinated compounds. Who knows when we'll find the next scandal like this?\" he said. \"For infants to be exposed at this early and vulnerable age is something that worries me greatly.\"Still Breastfeed, If You CanAsa Bradman, an environmental health expert at the University of California, Berkeley, underscored that mothers should not be fearful about breastfeeding. His own research has concluded that even among children whose mothers had high blood levels of DDT, those who were breastfed experienced healthier development than their formula-fed peers.Given his findings, Grandjean suggests that the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the risks, for at least a baby's first 3 to 4 months of life.And the benefits of breastfeeding extend to the mother. Women who are able and choose to breastfeed may more quickly shed pregnancy pounds. The practice can improve a mother's bond with the baby, and can even save the family money. Breast milk, unlike formula, is free.What's more, opting for formula doesn't necessarily protect an infant from dangerous chemicals, since community water supplies can carry high levels of PFASs. In a separate report also published on Thursday, the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found that even tiny concentrations of a PFASs chemical in drinking water can pose a serious threat to public health. The group refers to Grandjean's previous research, which concluded that the EPA's provisional drinking water limit for PFOA and PFASs, set in 2009, is between 100 and 1000 times too high.And if all that isn't enough to encourage breastfeeding, experts note that the practice can also decrease a mother's own burden of toxic chemicals.\"Nursing a baby is the ultimate detox diet,\" writes Florence Williams in her book Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History. As she explains, mothers who breastfeed for a year can \"siphon off\" to their infants 90 percent of their body burden of perfluorinated compounds, including PFASs.In the new study, some of the children’s blood levels of PFASs exceeded that of their mothers' by the end of breastfeeding.Of course, therein lies the irony -- and the trouble. Is breast milk just another way we pass our pollution problems on to the next generation?'Kicking The Can Down The Road'Bill Walker, an investigations editor for the Environmental Working Group, suggested PFASs are a \"poster child\" for what is wrong with current toxic chemical regulation in the U.S. While the EPA was first alerted in 2001 to the class of chemicals contaminating drinking water, he noted, the agency remains another six to seven years away from enacting regulations.Experts raise similar concerns over the sources of these chemicals.By the end of 2015, some of the most notorious PFASs will be fully phased out of production in the U.S. \"These voluntary industry efforts have resulted in reduction of these substances in the environment,\" wrote Jessica Bowman, the executive director of the FluoroCouncil, an arm of the industry group American Chemistry Council, in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post. “To help support that phase-out, our member companies developed alternatives, based on short-chain PFAS. The alternatives are some of the most robustly-studied new chemicals introduced into the market.\"But as HuffPost reported in May, experts worry this new group of PFASs may still share many of the same concerning characteristics as their predecessors. They also say this pattern of simply replacing known toxins with their chemical cousins, whose safety may remain largely unknown, is a result of the nation's outdated toxic chemical legislation, which allows chemicals to remain innocent until proven guilty.\"The way the Toxic Substances Control Act is set up now, it's a dangerous experiment being conducted on all of us,\" said Walker. \"Chemical companies are allowed to expose us to their products without knowing whether or not they're safe.\"\"We're just kicking the can down the road. We're letting our children worry about it,\" added Tracey Woodruff, director of the University of California, San Francisco Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment.The U.S. Senate will be reconvening to consider an update to the nearly 40-year-old TSCA this fall. The bipartisan proposal has faced stiff criticism from some environmental health advocates.\"The bill has not gone far enough in terms of protecting state preemption and really reflecting the state of the science on chemical risks,\" said Woodruff. \"But there's a lot of pressure to make something happen.\"While prospective and young mothers can take some precautions of their own, such as avoiding products that contain nonstick, stain-resistant, and waterproof coatings, their power to protect their progeny from tainted breast milk is limited. \"You'd have to start as a teenager to prevent the buildup over time,\" said Grandjean. \"That's not something that new moms can do much about.\"\"I'm calling for more research attention on the passage of industrial chemicals into human milk. We are not testing for that,\" he added, noting that the FDA requires drug companies to provide information about whether their products are safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. \"But with industrial chemicals, we assume that they are safe.\"\"Breasts, it turns out, are a particularly fine mirror of our industrial lives,\" Williams wrote in her book. And this fact may actually attract needed attention and drive change. It was after persistent organic pollutants began appearing in human milk, for example, that countries took steps to ban them.\"Breast milk carries some political weight,\" she wrote."}, {"title": "How Our Government Could Alter the Coast We Know and Love", "text": "My career studying oil spill impacts came about by accident - an actual accident. I was establishing field experiments in a coastal lagoon when the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill occurred through a blowout at a nearby oil platform. My experiments ruined, I volunteered in oil response efforts and in reviewing shoreline impact studies. Oil had touched me then and would do so again.In 1989, I was appointed to the Oil Spill Trustees science review panel after the Exxon Valdez disaster, ultimately making dozens of trips to Alaska to integrate efforts by teams of researchers working to understand the fate of the oiled coasts and coastal life and to forecast how long recovery might take. We knew this research was critical to a new understanding of offshore oil drilling risks and future spills.And future spills happened. The nation watched as grainy camera images depicted failed efforts to stem oil gushing from the sea floor for 87 days following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The dark oil plumes that spread over increasing areas of the sea surface showed that we - the country and the oil and gas industry - were again woefully unprepared to mount an effective response. And now attention is focused on Santa Barbara once may in the wake of the May 19 spill on Refugio Beach.A decision looms now for the South Atlantic coast, where the Department of the Interior is deciding whether to open the seafloor from Virginia to Georgia to oil and gas leasing - a shift in federal and state policies.   For judging the merit of offshore oil drilling in my own backyard, I pose four questions: What is the potential oil yield versus costs of extracting it? What are the obvious risks of oil drilling off our South Atlantic Coast? Is scientific study of ocean physics, biologically valuable resources, and socioeconomics of coastal communities sufficient to predict impacts and direct effective response actions to prevent a spill from becoming catastrophic? Are there viable energy alternatives to offshore oil drilling?The answer to each question reveals that oil drilling off North Carolina and the other Southeast states risks much for the many and gains little for a few.First, known oil and gas reserves off North Carolina are very small - maybe enough to supply the U.S. with gas for two months and oil for nine, and at depths that make drilling expensive and risky.Second, serious risks are clear and far-reaching to our coastal economies, cultures, seafood harvests, and human communities from Georgia to Virginia. Our southern coasts are home to some of the country's most attractive beaches, extensive seagrass, oyster reef, and marsh habitats, and a wealth of spectacular marine organisms.Our Southeast coastal economy is based upon this clean and healthy environment - from tourism and fishing to real estate development and retirement industries. These industries would be threatened by oil drilling, not just from the threat of a major blowout and spill but from the many small spills, discharges, and releases happening daily. The collateral heavy industrialization that follows oil production, from pipelines to refineries, would conflict with the livable communities, vacation meccas, and the retirement industry of the Southeast coast.Third, based on both a review of available scientific information and considering the response failures to contain the Exxon Valdez spill and cap the Deepwater Horizon blowout, I conclude that more science and technology are needed. Lacking are: (a) verified dynamic 3-D ocean circulation models off the Southeast coast to enable accurate prediction of the fate of spilled oil; (b) full functional understanding of globally unique habitats such as \"The Point\" off Cape Hatteras, and the floating Sargassum ecosystem, both of which support populations of valuable fishes, sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals; and (c) detailed socioeconomics for human communities and resources at risk all along the Southeast coast.Experience makes it difficult to trust the oil and gas industry to conduct the technical research and development needed to maintain preparedness to nip oil pollution disasters in the bud. The recent news that the latest Santa Barbara spill may have been caused by a corroded pipe only serves to further undermine my faith in the industry's technical readiness.Lastly, is there an alternative? We have a wealth of renewable energy opportunities in the Southeast, and North Carolina's potential for offshore wind energy production may be the greatest in the country. Offshore renewable energy development would bring well-paying, high-tech jobs to local people. The societal consequences of success for us Southeast Atlantic coastal residents are nowhere near as bright with offshore oil drilling as they are with wind.This issue is not about ensuring sufficient scientific research on ecosystem responses to oil spills - it's about the fishermen I see every day, the neighbors who escape outside with me for long beach walks, the retirees and vacationers, and the many others whose lives depend on our coastal environment and resources, such as realtors and surf shop owners. This decision by our federal government could forever alter the coast we know and love."}, {"title": "Through Your Lens: 9 Volcanoes Around The World That Will Take Your Breath Away", "text": "The WorldPost's \"Through Your Lens\" series brings you mesmerizing photos taken by social media users in different countries around the world every week.Volcanoes, formed by magma rising from the Earth's crust, are formidable forces of nature.

I had the honor of participating in the Symposium in Istanbul and speaking as the Jewish representative in the interfaith session of the event.Istanbul served as a fitting venue for the Symposium, since it reveals many of the causes of and solutions to climate change. Home to fourteen million people, it is Europe's largest city, the fifth largest city in the world, and has grown ten-fold since 1950. Its metro is the third largest in the world, with 800,000 daily riders, and a separate Metrobus system has 600,000 daily riders. Car ownership is low compared to elsewhere in Europe, with 75% of the population relying on alternative forms of transportation. Yet, according to the World Bank, Istanbul's sulfur dioxide combined with its vehicular and industrial air pollution makes it the seventh most polluted city in the world. Istanbul has been engaged in a fast rate of economic growth for the past 20 years and boasts the largest number of shopping malls of any European city.Istanbul also likely has the greatest number of vendors standing between lanes of car traffic selling water on a hot August day. Undoubtedly, some of these vendors are among the 1.7 million Syrian refugees Turkey has absorbed due to the neighboring conflict. A recent scientific study contends that the war started in part due to a four-year drought exacerbated by climate change. Thomas Friedman reminds us today of the way climate change is impacting the Middle East in his eye-opening piece, \"The World's Hot Spot.\"A Muslim megacity that is growing rapidly in population and material wealth - two main drivers of climate change - therefore served as an apt site for an Islamic Climate Change Symposium. The Symposium centered upon the launch of the Islamic Climate Change Declaration. Muslim clerics gathered with clergy of other faiths to offer, in the words of the Declaration, an \"urgent and radical reappraisal\" of modern society. The Symposium delivered a moral call to change course. The Declaration stated, \"We note with alarm the combined impacts of rising per capita consumption combined with the rising human population\" (p. 2).The Declaration was put forth as a Muslim teaching on care for our common home, exactly two months after the release of Pope Francis' groundbreaking Encyclical, Laudato Si. A Catholic symposium on climate change: People and Planet First, took place in late June, organized by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and CIDSE.The Islamic Declaration reads with a similar air of spiritual richness and scientific calculation as Laudato Si, although it is less lengthy, and the world's 1.7 billion Muslims do not recognize a unifying religious authority like the Pope. Nevertheless, three Grand Muftis, clerics from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Indonesia endorsed the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change and spoke at the Symposium. Speaker information can be viewed here.The Declaration was written by an international group of Islamic scholars, with a vision to draw on their ancient tradition to provide solutions to the modern crisis of climate change. These scholars include Prof. Din Syamsuddin, President of the Indonesian Ulama (Islamic Scholars) Council, representing Indonesia's 200 million Muslims, and Fazlun Khalid, founder of the Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environment Sciences (IFEES). The Symposium was co-organized by IFEES, GreenFaith, and Islamic Relief Worldwide, and drew significant international figures, including the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, Ibrahim Thiaw.The Declaration incorporates this excerpt from the Koran: \"Corruption has appeared on land and sea. Because of what people's own hands have wrought, so that they may taste something of what they have done; so that hopefully they will turn back\" (30:41). Based on this, the Declaration states,We recognize the corruption (fasad) that humans have caused on the Earth due to our relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption. Its consequences have been-- • Global climate change, which is our present concern, in addition to: • Contamination and befoulment of the atmosphere, land, inland water systems, and seas; • Soil erosion, deforestation and desertification; • Destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of the habitats of the earth's communities of life, with devastation of some of the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems such as rainforests, freshwater wetlands, and coral reefs; • Impairment of ecosystem benefits and services; • Introduction of invasive alien species and genetically modified organisms; • Damage to human health, including a host of modern-day diseases.Notably the Declaration also states, \"We call on the people of all nations and their leaders to...Realize that to chase after unlimited economic growth in a planet that is finite and already overloaded is not viable. Growth must be pursued wisely and in moderation\", and \"We call upon corporations, finance, and the business sector to change from the current business model which is based on an unsustainable escalating economy, and to adopt a circular economy that is wholly sustainable.\"I am impressed by the breadth and profundity of what is written in this Declaration. It is not only about climate change, but about 'care for our common home' in a broad sense. It reminds me of a teaching of Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler: \"Human beings believe, in their arrogance, that if they continue developing the world on the basis of an ever-expanding science and technology, they will eventually achieve an environment that will afford everyone unlimited gratification of the senses and a life of untrammeled ease and pleasure. There can be no greater error than this.\"The organization that I founded and direct, the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development, will soon present the Arabic version of the Declaration to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.To quote Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, I was \"witness to the dignity of difference and the power of faith to heal a fractured world.\" I am proud to have taken part in this significant step forward for the world's Muslims and all of humanity, and to find common cause with my Muslim brothers and sisters in faith to enable our children to inherit a livable planet.Sarah Lyons and Dalia Gladstein contributed to this post.

I took my senior high school portrait on that grass. My wife and I were married on that grass. Up until last year, we held our kids’ Easter egg hunts on that grass.Not any more. My parents spent a good month tearing out that grass this summer in favor of redwood mulch, river rock and drought/deer-tolerant vegetation. Removing the lawn was a painful process, both for the back and for a scrapbook full of grassy-knoll memories, but it was a major reason why they were able to slash their water use this summer.Photo by Brian Milne.Greywater Garden Irrigation SystemWe’ve always had a greywater irrigation system for the rose garden. It just made sense with a washer located on the back part of the house, just a few feet from the rose garden.All it took was running a small hose out of the back of the washer to the garden out back, which receives a few gallons of greywater runoff every time a load of wash runs.The good news for Californians is that greywater system regulations have improved because of a lack a water resources. Some agencies even provide financial incentives for buildings that reuse water for irrigation purposes.Photo by Brian Milne.Portable ShowerOn the coast of California, we're pretty fortunate to live so close to one of our largest water resources in the Pacific Ocean. But as we all know, desalination plants are expensive, and there’s only so much we can do with saltwater currently.Additionally, many coastal towns such as drought-parched Cambria, as well as California state parks, have cut back water use and no longer have running water for the public, whether that be for outdoor showers or even flush toilets.Along the California coast, the new norm is port-a-potties and disinfectant gel, so more and more residents are starting to bring their own water when they head to the beach.I enjoy surfing with the kids on the weekends, so to help cut down public water use, I've turned an unused Roundup Weed Killer spray bottle into a mobile shower. It’s portable, pressurized and person-powered so it won’t drain your battery. I’ve even painted the jug black, so the water warms in the sun while we’re in the water.In the end, my post-surf showers use less than 2 gallons of water, which is about 15 gallons less than the average American uses when showering on a given day.Photo by Brian Milne.While we're on the topic, another good way to save water while showering at home is to put a 5-gallon bucket under the faucet and capture excess water as it warms for irrigating your plants. We save a gallon or two per shower using this method in our master bathroom, located on the opposite side of the house from our water heater.Rain Gutter Water CaptureWhen it does finally rain, like it did this past July when we saw 3.5 inches in two days, we need to be prepared with not only flood protection for our barren landscapes, but with rain-capture projects that guide runoff to key areas, reservoirs or tanks for future use.As with greywater systems, I tend to fall back on simple rain-capture devices. One easy one is to put buckets under your rain gutter runoff points to capture water that would otherwise run into the gutter.During a July thunderstorm, I was able to fill trashcans with water each night by removing the endcaps on our rain gutter and placing the cans under the drop points. After cleaning our rain gutters out, I nearly filled a yard waste container on the final night of the storm, using the water for landscape irrigation.While many of these techniques are simple and don't take a ton of cutting-edge technology, they also don't take a ton of effort and show just how easy it is to implement sustainable-water projects around the house.Here’s to more rain, and water conservation projects, in coming months!Have a creative home water conservation project worth sharing?

The video of Clinton's response is painful to watch, in part because it's so emblematic of the cautiousness and doublespeak that even her supporters wish their candidate would move away from.\"I am not going to second guess [President Barack Obama] because I was in a position to set this in motion,\" Clinton said, referencing the pipeline review process that she oversaw as Secretary of State. \"I want to wait and see what he and Secretary Kerry decide.\"She then followed up with what might be one of the worst rejoinders ever delivered from the campaign trail, \"If it is undecided when I become president, I will answer your question.\" Translation: vote for me, and then I'll tell you what I stand for. It's the sort of answer that subverts the entire idea of having an election in the first place.Within a few hours, a video of the fumble was plastered across nearly every major news site in the country. Politico called the answer a \"dodge,\" while the Times said that Clinton seemed \"stumped,\" and the Washington Post labeled the whole thing a \"ridiculous hedge.\" Clinton's opponents also jumped all over the misstep. \"Well, listen, needless to say, I have a hard time understanding that response,\" Bernie Sanders told ABC. \"I have helped lead the effort against the Keystone pipeline.\"Clinton, on the other hand, has done rather the opposite. Back in 2010, before the pipeline had even gone through an initial review process at the State Department, Clinton said she was \"inclined to approve\" the project. The process she then oversaw was so riddled with controversy and incompetence that the State Department was forced to go back to the drawing board multiple times, while their own inspector general investigated the department over serious conflict of interest allegations.Other allegations centered around Hillary Clinton herself. One of Clinton's 2008 deputy campaign managers, Paul Elliot, went on to become a lead lobbyist for TransCanada, the company looking to build Keystone XL. For her 2016 campaign, Clinton has hired a another lobbyist, Jeffrey Berman, whose firm received $120,000 to lobby the State Department for the Keystone XL's approval. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars in donations from ExxonMobil, who stands to profit handsomely from the expansion of the Canadian tar sands, as well as donations from Canada's Foreign Affairs, Trade and Management agency, which supports the pipeline.All these swirling connections only reinforce the perception created by the controversy over Clinton's deleted State Department emails: she's crooked, compromised, and has something to hide. A pipeline approval would cement that reputation. As Clinton said herself, she set this whole crazy, mismanaged review process in motion. If Keystone XL goes forward, it won't just ruin President Obama's climate legacy: it will take out Clinton's as well.Which isn't to say that Clinton's record on climate is much to begin with. During her tenure as Secretary of State, Clinton oversaw the U.S. involvement in the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks. As Mother Jones documented, Clinton's State Department went on to sell fracking around the world, muscling weaker nations into expanding oil and gas development. All of which has been adding up to headlines like this one: \"Why Environmentalists Are Anxious About Hillary Clinton.\"Clinton seems to know that she has a climate credibility gap, and understands that she's in a bind on Keystone XL. And her campaign must recognize that's going to be a problem when it comes to reaching out to the voters she needs to win a Democratic primary and carry her through the general election. Those dual realizations have led to some interesting maneuvering as of late.Earlier this week, the Associated Press reported that Clinton was seeking to make up lost ground on climate issues. On Tuesday, she came out against Arctic drilling, tweeting \"The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling.\" That's a significant move. Scientists have made it clear that in order to keep global warming below 2°C we must keep 100% of Arctic oil in the ground: there's simply no room in the atmosphere for setting off that carbon bomb. Yet the oil industry, and Shell in particular, have turned the Arctic their Holy Grail (an oil filled one, that is). Standing up the industry and saying no is something the Obama administration has so far failed to do. Clinton's stance is a big improvement.But that still leaves the question of Keystone XL. In a follow up question on the pipeline, Clinton said that she \"would really hope\" a decision on the pipeline comes soon. \"But I am getting impatient,\" she continued, \"because I feel that at some point a decision needs to be made. And I'm not comfortable saying, you know, 'I have to keep my opinion to myself' given the fact that I was involved in it. So at some point I may change my view on that.\"That change in view would be welcomed by Keystone XL opponents, as it should be by Clinton supporters. Just because the pipeline has mostly been a problem for Clinton doesn't mean that it can't now become an opportunity. While a Keystone XL approval would sink her ability to reach out environmental voters, progressives and young people--all of whom have opposed Keystone XL in the hundreds of thousands--a muscular rejection would provide Clinton with an opening.To take advantage of it, she'll have to do more than waffle back and forth about an \"all of the above\" energy strategy or just wave around razzmatazz proposals like \"500 million solar panels.\" She'll need to join candidates like Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley by coming out for a full transition away from fossil fuels and towards 100% renewable energy. She'll need to talk seriously about environmental justice, and the impacts that projects like Keystone XL, and the climate impacts they cause, have on vulnerable communities. And she'll need to say that this pipeline is just a start: as President, she'll work to find more ways to stand up to Big Oil and keep fossil fuels in the ground.Let's hope the next time Hillary Clinton gets a question about Keystone XL she's prepared with the right answer: \"I would reject it...and that would be just the beginning.\""}, {"title": "My Tour Through Our National Parks With Members of Congress", "text": "Under a sky pregnant with stars, his laser pointer stroking constellations and planets as he named them, astronaut Story Musgrave told his audience,\"This is the first time in history that humans are taking most of our information from 'content' developed by other humans, and almost completely ignoring nature.

Curiously, the venerable E.O. Wilson established 30 years ago the theory of biophilia, which says that our need for nature is biological, not just recreational, since we evolved in nature. (I'm meeting him Sept. 26 at the 125th Anniversary Gala of Rock Creek Park at the Italian Embassy in DC!)So is there a relationship between our great disconnect from nature and the strident, bombastic attitude which seems uppermost in our country right now? So much \"content\" and \"information\" from innumerable sources, but little of it points us to beauty, to our shared values as human beings, or to the \"truths we hold to be self-evident.\"I am sometimes tempted to tune it all out, EXCEPT that I've toured 171 units of our National Park System and I KNOW the struggle, the blood, sweat, tears, the courage endurance that it took to get our country to the state where every American has a voice. Knowing that I am the beneficiary of such a huge investment of human and natural capital, how can I sit back and let it all go down under the cult of greed and personality to become an oligarchy? The first director of the National Park Service Stephen Mather was right when he said, \"He or she is a better citizen, with a keener appreciation of the privilege of living here, who has traveled the national parks.\"So I propose that exploring our National Park System is the cure to reconnect us with nature and remind us that we are part of it and not ABOVE it, to remind us where we've come from and show us where we're going. I'm starting by inviting 40 Members of the US Congress to join me on a virtual \"Voyage of Rediscovery.\" Like the 19th Century Corps of Discovery explored the physical dimensions of our continent, this tour will reconnect us literally with the homeland and plumb new internal horizons of being.Over the years Frank and I have taken thousands of people on their first visit to a national park. We've seen it affect the young man who grew up dodging bullets in his Miami neighborhood the same way it affected the buttoned-down founder of a successful equity firm. It made them lower their defenses and become childlike again for a few hours. I'm banking on any crack in the shield to provide an opening for change.Once they've agreed, I'll enlist my friend Sid Wilson's A Private Guide to provide us with luxury transportation. Our colleague mountaineer Stephen Shobe, who's summited four of the highest mountains on Earth, 65-year-old outdoorswoman Carolyn Hartfield and nature-writer Jarid Manos will be among our guides.I visualize our guests piling out of the coach at Kenilworth Park Aquatic Gardens in DC, our first stop. Their jaws drop in amazement as they walk through the sheltering tall oak trees and into an explosion of bobbing multicolored lotus and lily blooms as far as they can see. I see them strolling leisurely along the path in pairs and threes, stopping to observe a particularly beguiling bloom, talking desultorily with their colleagues. Thoughts of competition and parties and agendas have been replaced by the sweet feelings of appreciation I felt when I first saw the Gardens, putting me in mind of the Grand Canyon.I see them listening attentively to the young park ranger of color sharing the story of Walter Shaw who lost one arm in the Civil War and spent the rest of his life creating the water gardens which his daughter Helen persuaded Congress to save as a park. They'll be struck by the power of the human spirit to persevere and collaborate, to leave a legacy that benefits society.From Kenilworth we'll drive to Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. Our guests are relaxed and I can see the look of satisfaction and joy on their faces of the congressmen as we navigate the winding Skyline Drive, and stunning views of stacked green mountains and valleys undulate into view.Audrey Tutt-Smith and Elaine Blakey are in this picture taken last year at Lewis Mountain and their families are in the photos and artifacts the park ranger shared.  We'll take leisurely walks through the park ending up at Lewis Mountain, the section reserved for the use of Negroes until the 1950s. Our friends the venerable Audrey Tutt-Smith and Elaine Blakey who grew up in nearby Luray will share how much they looked forward to their visits to the park in the segregated years and how they enjoyed being in nature. They'll tell how the great smell of food cooking in Lewis Mountain drew white visitors across the berm that had been erected to keep the Blacks out of sight. They'll share that their story and artifacts are now part of an interactive museum exhibit in the park's visitor center.At day's end we'll drive down the mountain to our friend Darryl Haley's bed and breakfast in Luray.

That's a large margin for weather records.Weather monitoring data stretches back more than 135 years, to 1880. But nine of the 10 hottest months on record have happened since 2005.Even though we only have 150 years of data to look at, tree rings, ice cores and coral formations show the planet is the warmest it's been since at least 4,000 years ago, Mashable notes.The first seven months of 2015 are the hottest January-to-July span on record. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jake Crouch told The Associated Press it's quite likely that 2015 will end up the hottest year on record, beating last year.Crouch said the planet may also get a temperature boost this year from the \"Godzilla El Niño\" brewing in the Pacific Ocean, which is the heating of the equatorial region and affects weather around the globe, especially the U.S. in winter. Researchers have warned that this phenomenon could be \"one of the three or four strongest events on record.\"Climate scientist Michael Mann pointed out that the shattering of these unprecedented global warming records is unequivocal proof that humans are directly impacting the changes in the climate.\"It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be seeing a record year, during a record-warm decade, during a multidecadal period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled over at least the past millennium, if it were not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by fossil fuel burning,\" he told The Huffington Post in January of this year, after 2014 was declared the hottest year on record.The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Rescue Vampire Cat Loki Is Devilishly Cute", "text": "Loki is not like other cats, since she's got two large canine teeth that peek out from her mouth and give her a vampire look.

If we allow that coal, oil and natural gas to be developed, we'll cripple America's ability to meet its obligation to cut carbon and avoid the worst effects of the global climate crisis.That's why it's never been more clear that President Obama - and whoever comes after him in the White House - needs to pledge to ban new fossil fuel leases on U.S. public lands and offshore coastal areas.We've reached a critical moment in the future of our planet and what we decide - including increased exploitation of our public lands for oil, gas and coal - is going to have far-ranging consequences for us now as well as the generations who come after us.Pope Francis was right in June calling for bold action on \"a global problem with grave implications.\"The Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Earth commissioned carbon modelers at EcoShift Consulting to gain a better understanding of the carbon costs of developing our remaining federal fossil fuels.The results of this analysis are staggering: Our remaining unleased publicly owned fossil fuels contain up to 450 billion tons of climate-disrupting greenhouse gases.That's the equivalent annual pollution of more than 118,000 coal-fired power plants and 95 billion cars, and it's way more than any reasonable U.S. share of the global carbon budget.President Obama has shown a disturbing willingness to continue leasing our public lands and oceans to the fossil fuel industry- witness his administration's approval for drilling in the Arctic and expansion along the Atlantic Coast. Each new lease commits us to more climate disruption.Now that we know where this leads us - 450 billion tons closer to global climate catastrophe - there can be no more pretending that we can simply continue selling these leases and letting these massive deposits of fossil fuels go up in smoke. In fact, we're left with only one option: Keep them in the ground."}, {"title": "Another Beauty Myth About Flawless Skin, Busted", "text": "In the quest for flawless skin, some people are willing to try just about anything that doesn't involve a heap of money or a degree of pain. They'll adopt a detailed nighttime skincare routine to tackle different problem areas (they shouldn't), they'll cut dairy from their diets hoping it will reduce acne (it will), they'll avoid grilling food frequently in case it can help skin look less wrinkled (it can), and they'll hop onto any remotely promising beauty trend that just might work.One of these common trends is drinking beverages that contain relatively unusual ingredients like charcoal or aloe. The premise is that these products claim to address issues like acne and aging skin, but dermatologist Angela Lamb cautions against placing too much stock in those assertions.\"I have a name for things that people are drinking that really aren't ... doing what they claim,\" she tells #OWNSHOW in the above video. \"They're 'bogus beauty beverages,' or BBBs.\"Unfortunately, there just hasn't been a lot of research that drinking any of these types of things helps your complexion,\" she continues.While charcoal and aloe are said to have healing properties, Dr. Lamb explains that ingesting the ingredients isn't the ideal way to receive those skincare benefits.\"Most of this doesn't actually get processed or absorbed into the skin. It gets processed, really, too quickly,\" she says.Instead, placing these ingredients directly on the skin is a better way to go.\"Charcoal is really great on your skin as a mask,\" Dr. Lamb says. \"If you're putting it on your skin, it can draw out impurities [and] it can dry up some residual blemishes. But as a drink, it's not really great because all it's doing is going right through [your system]. It's not doing anything to come into your pores and actually help your skin.\"As for what we should be drinking, water is the beauty beverage winner. Beyond that, Dr. Lamb only recommends a few other types of drinks. \"Some of the smoothies that have some good antioxidants, some of the green drinks... those are great,\" she says.For those that believe they have seen improvement in their skin after drinking a trendy beverage or going on a cleanse, the real reason might have more to do with what they're elimination from their diets, rather than what they're adding.\"Probably, they're replacing some of the junk food that wasn't so good for their skin or their health in general with things that are just... intrinsically more healthy,\" Dr. Lamb points out. \"That definitely leads to a better complexion, so that we can ideally get to that end goal, which is what you want, which is just fabulous skin.\"Related: How the condition of your skin can warn you about your internal healthAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "GMOs: The Evolution of Emerging Technologies", "text": "Walk down the center aisles of any supermarket and you will be surrounded by cartons, cans and jars that represent our modern diet. Processed, prefabbed foods, perennially ready to eat, warm up, dine out, dash in - for those on the go. If you don't see the USDA Certified Organic or Non-GMO Verified label, you can count on GMO ingredients inside those containers. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) estimates that more than 75% of those packaged, processed, center-of-the-store foods contain genetically modified ingredients. What in the world are they and what is all the fuss about?GMOs, genetically engineered or altered, are living organisms that have had their DNA changed in ways that do not occur in nature. A scientist in a laboratory uses radical, often brutal techniques, be they chemical or mechanical, to force the DNA of one species into the DNA of an entirely different species.Think strawberry and fish or cats injected with fluorescent proteins that make them glow in the dark. Consider goat and spider DNA married in an unbiblical way. This is very different than traditional cross breeding or hybridizing plants and animals. It's obvious that these combinations could never exist outside of the lab, yet the FDA and EPA don't recognize them as substantially different. Genetic engineering forcefully alters the natural occurring barrier between species, creating new living patented entities that have the potential to be unstable.Industry-fueled science continues to usher in a more unique combination of life forms and genetically altered entities. Genetically altered trees and mosquitoes are already being introduced. They can potentially spread their pollen to native trees or breed with wild insects. The Scotts Company just announced that they will be commercializing grass that has been genetically altered to resist glyphosate (Roundup®). GMO grass will now be planted in public venues with absolutely no oversight or regulation. No one is assuring that we avoid genetic contamination of the natural world.But as consumers wake up to the GMOs in their grocery cart, the biotech industry is already going beyond to a new generation of even more extreme genetic engineering techniques that promise to change life faster, cheaper and in more fundamental ways. This new basket of genetic tools comes with its own set of acronyms, but at root it's just the same genetic engineering mindset on steroids.Take for example CRISPR - that's a new gene-editing tool that radically alters the traits of insects and plants and has been called the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Using CRISPR, scientists are now developing powerful genetic 'instructions' known as 'gene drives' that have the potential to aggressively spread and re-engineer entire populations of a species in a very short time or even to eradicate whole species. Good for us if we are looking to wipe out pests and disease, but troubling if accidental release from labs occurs, because these \"super\" organisms could spread rapidly and cause health and environmental disasters. Twenty-seven esteemed scientists weighed in calling for strict controls and caution. Meanwhile, technology continues to race forward.One of the newest and most \"promising\" according to Monsanto is an emerging technology that can alter the genes of plants just by spraying them with RNA. This is not technically a genetically modified organism, but it does indeed control their cell structure. No one knows how this technique of modifying cells with a sprayer will affect other plants, animals and the humans that ingest it. \"The Next Great GMO Debate\" in the MIT Technology Review offers more insight.The next landscape that genetic tinkering is literally cavalcading into is the hidden world of algae and yeast. In fact, that horse left the barn quite a while ago. With synthetic biology, scientists have figured out how to genetically modify algae or yeast so it \"manufactures\" unique substances like meat, leather, egg whites and milk. Modern Meadows is producing vegan leather and plans to grow vegan meat. Clara Foods will be serving up egg whites without the chickens and Muufri (\"moo-free\") has manipulated yeast cells to excrete cows' milk proteins, doing away with the inconvenience of dairy farming. Supporters call it a way to avoid animal welfare issues and the detrimental land, water and chemical effects of meat production, but these new synthetic animal products will still require agricultural inputs (mostly sugar) and represent a further industrialization of our food chain. How can this novel way of producing food and products be totally unregulated and untested for long-term environmental, social and health ramifications?Genetic engineering has gained quite a toe hold in almost every corner of our lives. Whether we eat from the center aisle of the supermarket, walk down that manicured golf course or one day fondle that vegan leather purse, genetic tinkering is increasingly all around us. As a species, we are changing the very core of life through our entrance into the world of DNA and RNA. In evolutionary terms, it's an unprecedented moment that life itself has become an industrially-manufactured product.The U.S. federal government spends millions to support these new technologies. An analysis by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center found that the U.S. government has spent around $430 million on research related to synthetic biology since 2005. They have spent nothing on environmental assessments.The fox often guards the hen house, and in this case, the wealth of corporate profit is being protected over the health and safety of our environment. In light of the rampant expansion of risky emerging technologies, it's time we adopted the precautionary principle. As stated by the Science and Environmental Health Network specifically, \"When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. In this context the proponent of an activity, rather than the public, should bear the burden of proof.\"You may be too young to remember the ad \"DDT- is good for me.\" Let us not forget this image. The original producers of DDT are still at it, promoting technologies before we fully know their long-term implications."}, {"title": "Why Cecil's Death Means More Than Walter Palmer Could Have Imagined", "text": "In late July, social media feeds worldwide erupted over the death of Cecil the lion, who was killed by Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer during a trophy hunting expedition in Zimbabwe.By now, much of the social media furor over the lion has died down, but Cecil's death has raised many important questions about the nature of activism and our collective response to injustice in our own backyards and around the world.We all remember that week in July when you couldn't turn on the TV or log onto Facebook without hearing about Cecil's tragic killing. And the outcry wasn't just limited to your circle of friends: over one million people signed a Care2 petition demanding justice for the lion, calling on the Zimbabwean government to ban trophy hunting.The petition demanding justice for Cecil was the fastest growing petition Care2 has ever hosted, gathering tens of thousands of signatures per hour. The flood of signatures spurned hundreds of news stories around the globe, helping to amplify the message petition signers were conveying and to inform and engage people around the world.The massive outcry was evidence of a huge cultural shift: an age of compassion. While many have criticized the backlash directed at Palmer, the outrage has also shown us that, when channeled constructively, our anger can create a movement that fuels positive change.Petitions play a vital role in a democratic society. They enable us to challenge systemic issues that allow injustices to manifest, and afford us the ability to speak out regardless of class, race, gender identity, religion, disability, political affiliation, or sexual orientation.Petitions also break through the gridlocked legislative process, getting results when government can't, or won't, act. They enable people to engage in society and create impact previously only seen through mass street demonstrations and strikes.While legislatures have debated hunting regulations for decades, it was an individual citizen who started the Cecil petition on Care2, leading to international uproar. The flood of signatures on the petition and accompanying outcry are good reminders that participating in the democratic process doesn't mean waiting for the next election. Ultimately, citizens have the power. One of the great forces fueling that shift comes from online petition sites that allow us to collectively, and very publicly, express our desire to make a difference.These petitions are also driving new national conversations. Cecil's death gave us the opportunity to challenge trophy hunting as a \"sport,\" and elected officials and corporations around the world are paying attention.Within days of the Cecil story breaking, the uproar spurred a series of related petitions targeting other institutions with influence in the trophy hunting industry -- and they worked. After over 157,000 signed a petition asking Delta Airlines to stop transporting hunting trophies, the airline announced it had officially banned the practice. Shortly after, American Airlines, United Airlines and Air Canada announced they had joined Delta in banning trophies.The petition demanding justice for Cecil was successful, too. It asked Zimbabwe to stop issuing permits for trophy hunting, and government officials heard the call loud and clear. Sure enough, on August 1, the country temporarily banned big game hunting in the area surrounding Hwange National Park, where Cecil was shot.The outcry surrounding Cecil also forced Palmer to temporarily shut down his dental practice. And last year, a student at a private high school in Tennessee started a petition that attracted over 108,000 signatures forcing the school to remove an African safari hunt from its annual fundraising auction.The message is clear: whether you're a business, a school, or a legislative body, people do not want to associate with institutions that violate their personal values. Public opinion matters, and citizens are exerting their collective power through the very public stage of online petitions more than ever before. The power is in the hands of the people.Cecil's death and the reaction to it has raised awareness about trophy hunting more than any other campaign in recent memory, and the impact will reverberate for years. Palmer may have paid $55,000 to hunt and kill Cecil, but that amount pales in comparison to the donations the viral outrage spurred for organizations like World Wildlife Fund, African Wildlife Foundation, and Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.The hunting lobby is fighting back, attempting to convince the public that trophy hunting funds are key to conservation efforts (although the facts don't support that). But the flood of donations ensured these organizations will continue to pursue conservation efforts for years to come.As the uproar surrounding Cecil's petition continues to ripple around the world, it shows the rising desire from people across the globe to right wrongs and move society in line with their values. Petitions offer a constructive outlet for this desire. The results can be extraordinary."}, {"title": "Study Finds Global Warming Has Made California's Drought Worse", "text": "Global warming is worsening the effects of California's historic drought, according to a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters this week.\"A lot of people think that the amount of rain that falls out the sky is the only thing that matters,\" lead author A.

But the researchers responsible for the video and related research say the tongues act more like tiny nectar-sucking pumps.\"What we found is that there is actually a micro-pump, which is transforming the whole tongue shape, and that transformation of the tongue shape is what actually pulls the fluid inside,\" Dr. Alejandro Rico-Guevara, a research scientist at the University of Connecticut and lead author of a paper about the research, told Discover magazine.The researchers used high-speed cameras to film the tongues of 18 hummingbird species as the birds sipped fluid from transparent feeders.

The true scale of the environmental harm done to the surrounding communities is just now becoming clear. Though there is significant work to be done in holding Exide and others accountable for what has happened, the absolute first priority is for a thorough and comprehensive cleanup to begin immediately.Earlier this week, the state's Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) estimated that as many as 1,000 homes may require immediate cleanup (their lead contamination levels are so high that the soil is considered hazardous waste), while up to 10,000 could require cleanup down the road. Since cleaning a single home costs roughly $40,000, cleaning up this many homes would cost around $400 million dollars. DTSC concedes this estimate to be accurate. And this doesn't even account for the cleaning needed inside the homes, where lead will have blown in through open windows or vents or have been tracked in on muddy shoes.It will be tempting for many of the agencies involved to delay cleanup until Exide and other responsible parties are finally compelled to pay the money required to address this environmental injustice. Exide has a stable of high-powered attorneys who can draw that process out for decades. Instead, we need to begin cleanup immediately and task the public's lawyers with getting that money back from the responsible parties later on.In my view, the best way forward would be for the state to appoint an independent and impartial expert to oversee the cleanup. This expert could begin by working with local, state and federal governments to identify immediately available funding that can be used for a rapid assessment of the impacted communities to identify the homes that need cleanup.While starting cleanup on the highest priority homes, the expert could, in parallel, bring together every agency with any jurisdiction over this issue to coordinate and implement a comprehensive plan for cleanup and for funding these efforts. Then, as I mentioned before, the lawyers from these agencies can get to work on recovering that money from the responsible parties. To help them in this task, the State should impanel a commission with the ability to get to find out what exactly happened and who is responsible. The public deserves a thorough and independent investigation into what happened and why it was allowed to happen.This issue is personal to me. My father spent two decades working at a battery recycling plant in City of Industry, and I saw firsthand the lifelong health impacts that resulted. It is imperative that the affected communities be restored to health. Every day that passes, the lead in these houses continues to harm the men, women and children who live there.It seems inarguable that the institutions charged with protecting these communities failed to fulfill this duty. We must not let this happen again. I am confident that by working together, local, state, and federal leaders can and will address this problem with the urgency it demands."}, {"title": "The Animas River Spill and the Myth of Mine Safety", "text": "The definition of a mine, said Mark Twain, is a hole in the ground owned by liars. And this month the industry's biggest lie -- that it can be trusted with our water -- is once again on display as another mining disaster has spilled millions of gallons of toxic mining waste and chemicals into our streams, rivers and lakes.On Aug. 5, at the abandoned Gold King mine in southwest Colorado, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup team inadvertently unleashed into a tributary of the Animas River a 3-million-gallon soup of toxic mining wastewater. The accident has closed the Animas indefinitely and threatens drinking water supplies, the economy and wildlife in the region, into New Mexico and potentially all the way to Lake Powell.A warning sign from the city is displayed in front of the Animas River as orange sludge from the spill at the Gold King mine upstream flows past Berg Park in Farmington, N.M. on Aug. 8. (Alexa Rogals / Associated Press)This latest tragedy followed by one year almost to the day a pair of mine containment failures in Canada and Mexico.On Aug. 4, 2014, at the Mount Polley copper and gold mine in central British Columbia, an earthen dam built 17 years ago to hold mining waste laced with mercury, lead, copper and other heavy metals -- called tailings -- failed, inundating the Fraser River watershed.Three days later and 1,200 miles south at the Buena Vista copper mine in Sonora, Mexico, 10 million gallons of mining acid turned the Bacanuchi and Sonora rivers orange with poisonous chemicals, shutting down drinking water supplies, closing schools and affecting an estimated 800,000 people. Called by Mexico's environment minister the \"worst natural disaster provoked by the mining industry in the modern history of Mexico,\" the spill was apparently caused by recently constructed but defective holding tanks.This trio of mining disasters is, or at least should be, a wake-up call. In an era of advancing climate change, fresh water is the indispensable natural resource, essential to life for everyone everywhere and becoming more valuable with each day of deepening drought. Yet staggering quantities of this precious resource are consumed by mining exploration, operations and long-term maintenance. Each year, roughly 180 million tons of tailings flow into rivers, lakes and oceans -- an estimate that leaves out the unpermitted contamination caused by containment failures like those at Gold King, Mount Polley and Buena Vista.Federal decision-makers should consider this damage as they decide whether to permit a host of massive mine projects around critical water bodies.Best known is a proposal to build the largest copper and gold mine in North America at the headwaters of the world's greatest wild salmon fishery, in southwest Alaska, which produces 30 million to 50 million fish each year. If the Pebble Mine were built as planned, it would generate an estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste laced with toxics -- about 3,000 pounds for every person on Earth -- to be contained forever in an area of high seismicity behind earthen dams as tall as the Three Gorges Dam in China. According to the EPA, the project poses a catastrophic risk to the waters of Bristol Bay, its wild salmon fishery and the $1.5 billion in revenue and 14,000 jobs it sustains each year.The battle over the Pebble Mine will set the stage for a long list of other proposed mining projects in risky proximity to critical waters: in Oregon, a nickel mine on a federally designated wild and scenic river that feeds the communities and natural wonders of the Northern California redwood coast; in Minnesota, copper and nickel mines that threaten the pristine waters of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness; in Montana, the Black Butte copper mine on Sheep Creek in the upper watershed of the Smith River, a state-designated Blue Ribbon Trout Fishery and an essential source of irrigation and stock water for ranchers.Although mining industry advocates argue correctly that mining is essential -- copper, for example, is ubiquitous in our cars, phones, computers and appliances -- there's no denying that mining is a dirty business. According to the EPA, mining produces more toxic waste than any other industry -- about 25 percent of the entire U.S. toxics inventory.The permissive General Mining Law of 1872, written to encourage mining, is still in force even though the pick, shovel and pan were long ago replaced by giant earthmovers that gouge open pits more than a mile across and thousands of feet deep. Billions of gallons of water are consumed in production, pumped through miles of vulnerable pipelines and stored in open pits of acidifying waste; huge swaths of land are destroyed in the wake of closed, abandoned and inadequately remediated mines.After this month's mine disaster on the Animas, there is even less reason to believe the self-serving, impossible promises of mining executives who claim that with good engineering, they can protect our waters for centuries. Although cutting-edge technology should be mandatory for all mining today, not all areas are mandatory for mining. Assurances of safety must be skeptically reviewed. And some mining projects -- such as the Pebble Mine -- just aren't worth the risk.This piece originally appeared as an op ed in the Los Angeles Times on August 13, 2015."}, {"title": "24 Wedding Ceremony Spaces That Make A Magical First Impression", "text": "Your wedding ceremony will set the stage for the rest of your big day.Make the right first impression by choosing a scenic location, adding some romantic decor and filling the space with lots and lots of love.

But I know I'm not alone. What is it about those glossy black and white creatures? Do we see in them a reflection of us? Is our bond with orcas more apparent than with other animals?I guess it doesn't hurt that orcas are essentially big dolphins -- very big (think of the difference between a smart car and two tractor-trailers). Orcas are social creatures, interacting with each other in complex and fascinating ways. And just as with dolphins, people report uncanny stories of connecting and interrelating with them.Not surprisingly, American Indian and First Nation tribes revere orcas. And it seems that every camera- and cell phone-toting eco-tourist on the West Coast can't get enough of them--they're practically celebrities. More than 400,000 people went whale watching in the waters off Washington State and British Columbia in 2014 alone.Orcas can be found in oceans across the world. Though they're beloved, the orcas that live off our U.S. Pacific coastline -- the Southern Resident Killer Whales -- are endangered. How can that be? Good question...These particular whales are part of one big clan living in three pods: J, K and L. They organize their society along matrilineal lines. Yep, each family centers on mom -- or more often, on the pod's grandmother or great-grandmother. (In fact, J Pod's granny is estimated to be 104 years old.)They also talk -- and each pod has a unique language. Just as we can tell the difference between a Texan and a Bostonian, scientists can tell the difference between groups of orcas.They celebrate. All three pods acknowledge each other, lining up as families when they come back into the Salish Sea.And just like some of us, they're picky eaters. Orcas eat only what mom eats, which means almost nothing but salmon -- 97 percent of their diet -- but not just any salmon. They prefer the biggest and fattest of them all -- the Chinook. These orcas move with the salmon, hugging the inland waters of Washington State to southern British Columbia from spring to fall. In winter, they expand their range south to California and north to Southeast Alaska.Yet they face a major problem -- a lack of food. The mighty rivers of the West -- including the Columbia Snake River watershed, a key source of Chinook -- have been broken. Though the Columbia Snake once brought salmon all the way from inland northern Nevada to the Pacific Ocean, today it is full of dams. The four lower Snake River dams kill millions of Chinook juveniles every year as they attempt to migrate downriver to the ocean.In the course of just a few decades, Southern Resident orcas went from gorging on a salmon-rich buffet to searching for some measly leftovers. As of early August 2015, there are 81 Southern Resident orcas. Four of these are calves born in the past six months. No calf has survived in the past two and a half years, though so these newest \"little ones\" aren't out of the woods yet. Mortality rates for first-born calves are in the 37-50 percent range. And many more of these orcas have died than survived (21 from 2010-2014). The Southern Resident population is moving in the wrong direction.Scientists had pinned their hopes on Rhapsody (J32), who had just reached mom-age at 18- years-old, to help her whole extended family grow. But in December 2014, hearts were broken when Rhapsody died carrying a nearly full-term female baby.A scientist who has studied these pods for 40 years surmised that Chinook salmon were so scarce that Rhapsody relied on her own blubber to keep her going. But as she tapped into that blubber, toxins stored there (called bioaccumulation) were released, harming her immune and reproductive systems. Her passing renews concerns about the fate of this whole population.While whale lovers and Rhapsody's family grieve for her, we have a chance to turn this sad story around. We can commit to save this extended family in time. The solution isn't just great for orcas, it is also great for people, salmon and all the species that rely on them.

Wild animals captivate children, and like many parents, I found picture books and stories of animals to give them a better understanding of the world around them. As my kids got older, we started learning about things such as habitat loss, endangered species and extinction. We studied animals who found themselves on the wrong side of human progress. The arctic fox. The leatherback turtle. Siberian tigers and the freshwater baiji dolphin.  With each animal and their fight to simply exist as they always have, we felt a deep pull to help. \"Why is this happening? What can we do?\" my children would ask, staring into photographed faces of seal pups and red pandas. We bought chocolate bars that contributed to saving the rainforest and \"adopted\" stuffed animals in the image of endangered species. Over the years, I watched these incredible creatures continue to diminish and realized that our efforts were not making a dent in this global issue. How do you tell your children that nothing they do can make a difference? I kept looking for solutions and found one.  Sacrificing Wild Animals for Meat  So now, I am totally excited! It turns out, changing your diet may be one of the most important and powerful things you can do to protect wildlife--and now there's the science to back it up. That's the conclusion of a group of ecologists who've just published an important study,  \"Biodiversity Conservation: The Key is Reducing Meat Consumption,\" in the journal Science of the Total Environment. They found that eating a hamburger or steak doesn't just take the life of one cow, it directly and indirectly takes the lives of threatened and endangered wild animals worldwide.  Lead author Brian Machovina, an ecologist at Florida International University, says his team was inspired to look at the growth of the meat industry around the world, and measure how that expansion is affecting biodiversity. Their finding? Livestock production is the single biggest driver of habitat loss in the world. Let's repeat that: livestock production is the biggest cause of habitat destruction in the world.  And without a habitat, the flora and fauna of places we revere--the Amazon rainforest, the African savannah, and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains--disappear.  Unfortunately, the popularity of meat-eating is increasing. China's economic boom has meant a ravenous demand for meat. Animal products make up 20 percent of the Chinese diet today, compared to 5 percent a half-century ago. Some of the most biodiverse countries in the world are chopping down forests to feed this demand. In Brazil, for example, almost 10 million acres of land is used to grow livestock feed for China. That's just part of the 60 million tons of soy feed products China imports from around the world each year. (Not surprisingly, China is now seeing a rise in chronic diseases linked to eating meat!)We can't point fingers at anyone though, with the average diet in the U.S. consisting of 45% meat and dairy.  Machovina also found that meat consumption was having a devastating effect on wildlife in Africa and Southeast Asia. Here, the hunting of \"bush meat\" (wild animals like porcupines, monkeys and bears) is just one more threat to animals that are also killed to protect livestock and face the destruction of their habitat for agriculture.I talked with William Ripple, a co-author of the study and an ecologist at Oregon State University. Even though he set out to study the connection between animal agriculture and habitat loss, he says he was \"dumbfounded\" by the sheer magnitude of the impact they found. What did he personally learn? Ripple's takeaway is sobering: \"It's either win-win-win or lose-lose-lose if we continue down the path of human carnivory.\"  What Can We Do? It's easy to look at these findings and be discouraged, but Machovina sees an opportunity, and I do too: \"If we can develop delicious plant-based foods, make them convenient and inexpensive, and market those products, that trend can spread around the world,\" he says. \"The choices people make here in the U.S. to reduce their consumption of animal products will affect the rest of the world.\"  After all, if Western diets influenced developing countries to eat more meat, we can reverse that trend by changing our own diets.  What does that mean? Machovina and his team suggest solutions, and there are two changes in particular that each one of us can make right now:Eat Less Meat: My family made the decision to go completely plant-based. If you're not ready for that step, this research suggests that reducing animal consumption to no more than 10 percent of our diets would allow us to feed our growing world without destroying any more wild habitat.  Replace beef with chicken and pigs:  Grazing animals like cows, sheep, goats require 20 times more land for every ton of meat produced, plus as much as three times more land for feed production -- not to mention producing more greenhouse gas emissions and waste. If you do eat meat, look for livestock with a lighter environmental footprint, like chicken.  Far from feeling like a sacrifice, these recommendations inspire enthusiastic action at my household. I can now tell my children that what they do does matter. It is simple and elegant and one person can indeed make a difference every meal, everyday. As my family has embraced a plant-based diet, we look our veggie burger squarely in the eye and feel good that elephants, tigers, the Honduras Rosewood Tree and African Baobab Tree might survive to see a green, diverse world for generations to come.So we choose win win win!

The airport is co-funded and operated by the Indian government through a public-private partnership.The airport’s energy neutrality is possible thanks to a 12-megawatt solar system consisting of more than 46,000 panels installed on a 50-acre site. The system can generate up to 60,000 units of electricity daily.According to Al Jazeera America, the project took six months to build and cost $10 million, which the airport anticipates it will recover within five years. The panels are expected to last 25 years.The panels were designed and installed by Bosch Ltd., which has a five-year partnership with the airport, according to Catch News.The airport began testing solar energy in March 2013, when it installed a small solar plant on the arrival terminal’s rooftop, according to The Economic Times.The project has been seen as a model for the rest of India, and the government is urging other airports to follow suit.India's goal is to ramp up solar capacity to 100 gigawatts by 2022. Its current capacity is four gigawatts.India has a broader goal to derive 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2022, with 3 percent coming exclusively from solar.

Just moments ago, I announced the initiative petition at the state house in Boston, accompanied by the CEOs of the Massachusetts SPCA, ASPCA, Animal Rescue League of Boston, and the Franklin Park Zoo. Other endorsers include the United Farm Workers, Mercy For Animals, the Center for Food Safety, Bon Appétit Management Company, and a long list of others.The measure, which will appear on the November 2016 ballot once we gather enough signatures from qualified Massachusetts voters, will require that veal calves, breeding sows, and laying hens have enough room to turn around, stand up, lie down, and freely extend their limbs. In short, it gets the animals out of cages barely larger than their bodies -- specifically out of veal crates, gestation crates, and battery cages. The measure also says that whole shell eggs and whole uncooked cuts of veal and pork sold in Massachusetts must come from animals kept in conditions that comply with its anti-confinement standards. That means that anyone wanting to sell such products in the Commonwealth, regardless of where they're based, must comply by the effective date of 2022. By dealing with production and sales, this measure will protect Massachusetts consumers from unsafe and inhumane products.This ballot measure comes after more than 100 major American food retailers have already adopted corporate policies to move in this direction -- in a cascade of announcements, made jointly with The HSUS in many cases, in the last four years. For instance, in May, in concert with The HSUS and other organizations, Walmart announced it would adopt the Five Freedoms of Farm Animal Welfare as a framework to guide its purchases of animal products. One of the Five Freedoms speaks to allowing animals to exhibit natural behaviors, and extreme confinement of sows in gestation crates or hens in battery cages certainly violates that principle. Aramark, Compass Group, General Mills, and Kellogg have also adopted the Five Freedoms. The nation's four largest food service providers -- which serve tens of millions of meals each day at university and corporate cafeterias, professional sports food sales operations, and so many others -- have all pledged to stop selling any eggs that come from caged hens.The Massachusetts ballot initiative, the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, is a balanced measure that gives producers more than five years to come into compliance with the standards, so they can appropriately shift their production systems to allow animals to move. We'd love to put it into practice tomorrow, but it's just not possible for it to happen that quickly, and we've been guided in part by the timelines set by some of the major food retailers in codifying these standards in Massachusetts. For instance, McDonald's has publicly announced it will be fully compliant with a no-gestation crate policy by the timeline set forth in this ballot measure.The American public and the rest of the global community are waking up to animal welfare. Look at the outrage over the appalling killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe, and the move by more than 30 airlines to stop shipping trophies from the Africa Big Five. Consider that Ringling Brothers earlier this year announced it would phase out its traveling elephant acts. Take the Walmart announcement on the Five Freedoms. This is the world's largest food retailer, and it has branded itself around the notion of keeping prices low for its customers. If it can make this humane pledge, then the day has arrived when we can set a baseline standard for the entire food sector. No producer, and no food retailer, should take moral shortcuts and allow animals to be subjected to lifelong privation and misery by immobilizing them in a cage or a crate barely larger than their body. So many forward-looking producers are transitioning to better systems and getting animals out of cages, and these corporate policies and public policies will provide incentives to get the remaining food companies on board.It is time to end the era of extreme confinement of animals, just as we are halting the era of trophy hunting of endangered or threatened species, as we end the era of commercial whaling, as we eliminate the era of legal dogfighting and cockfighting.The industrial agribusiness lobby will holler about this ballot initiative. But they are whistling not just in the wind, but in a gale force of societal disapproval for conduct that is appalling and unacceptable. We draw a line in the sand in Massachusetts. No more extreme confinement of animals raised for food. They deserve better. A civil society demands better.

But Silverton is a town that subsists on tourist dollars. And it gets its water from another site. Concerns about upstream water weren't enough to warrant the tourism-destroying Superfund label.So the EPA had to do more inspecting to bolster its argument for Superfund designation and accidentally breeched a secret dam built inside the mine to hold back accumulated snowmelt, unleashing three million gallons of poisonous sludge.Sure enough, as in the BP Deepwater Horizon spill, the tourism industry is the first to call for monetary damages.Then come livestock owners whose animals might be poisoned. And the vegetable farmers whose produce could be ruined unless they find an alternative source of water.Then there's the cost of the clean-up itself.But even those billions of dollars don't account for the loss of gorgeous, irreplaceable natural habitat along the now three hundred miles of fouled rivers.In our monetized, quantified world, we are driven to assign a value to this resource. And economists have a mechanism. Called \"contingent valuation,\" the tool is a survey in which subjects are asked their willingness to pay to protect nature.Intuitively, we know this is not remotely adequate. Economists and policy makers agree. And so scientists have set about trying to develop a better metric.A study on the neuroeconomics of valuation was just published in the journal PLOS One and summarized in a New York Times article by study authors Paul Glicher and Michael A. Livermore. Previous MRI's of the brain structures responsible for valuation showed great similarity across a wide variety of decisions, from consumer goods to entertainment to daily activities. But as the authors put it, \"The brain did not respond to contingent (environmental) valuation studies the way it did to all other known classes of economic behavior.\"In other words, when subjects tried to \"value\" nature, their MRIs showed different areas of the brain at work than those areas used to value other decisions.Could nature be on a different spectrum altogether? Maybe our brains process nature's value in ways unrelated to money.Those of us who walk in nature would agree.As it turns out, many economists agree too.One of them is Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. A 2009 report by the Stiglitz Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress looked at how economic statistics such as GDP fall short of measuring true economic performance:\"For example, traffic jams may increase GDP as a result of the increased use of gasoline, but obviously not the quality of life. Moreover, if citizens are concerned about the quality of air, and air pollution is increasing, then statistical measures which ignore air pollution will provide an inaccurate estimate of what is happening to citizens' well-being.\"The Stiglitz Commission goes further, insisting that \"The assessment of (environmental) sustainability is complementary to the question of current well-being, and must be examined separately. ...Both pieces of information are critical and distinct.\"Another way of saying that even rising public policy metrics such as Gross National Happiness in Bhutan or Subjective Well Being in the UK don't adequately address the value of the environment.Nature brings solace and sanity. If you haven't experienced the succor of nature personally, science has proved its benefits, most recently in a National Academy of Sciences study whose results suggest that \"accessible natural areas may be vital for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.\" Or to put it another way, nature's true value is priceless.Photo courtesy of Fishermansdaughter via Flickr CC"}, {"title": "25 Candid Photos That Show Breastfeeding Is Beautiful, Wherever You Nurse", "text": "After photos from her Public Breastfeeding Awareness Project (PABP) spread widely across the Internet last August, photographer and mom of four Leilani Rogers is continuing to normalize the sight of nursing and support lactating moms.In honor of National Breastfeeding Awareness Month this year, Rogers recruited over 70 photographers in the U.S., Australia, Italy, U.K., Venezuela and Canada to take pictures of moms nursing their children in public places like libraries, parks, stadiums and grocery stores. She's also invited other parents and photographers to share their own breastfeeding images on the project's Facebook page or on their own social media accounts with the hashtag #PBAP2015.Rogers was inspired by her own experiences with breastfeeding to launch the Public Breastfeeding Awareness Project in 2014, she told The Huffington Post. Though she overcame challenges with mastitis, bad latches, low supply, plugged ducts, thrush, staph infections and more, she says the one issue she was never able to face was her fear of breastfeeding in public.\"I avoided it at all costs,\" the mom said, explaining that she feared stares and judgment from strangers so much that she retreated to her house and made life more difficult by planning everything around each baby's feeding schedule. \"I wish I could go back and tell my former self not to care so much about what other people thought. Not to be ashamed of my body. Not to be self-conscious about openly doing what nature intended.\"Rogers hopes the Public Breastfeeding Awareness Project will empower moms by offering the support and community she wished she had. She also believes it may help break down the struggles breastfeeding moms face, not only in nursing successfully but also in overcoming societal barriers and expectations. \"Society’s support is paramount to a breastfeeding mother’s success,\" she said. \"Mothers are hiding in their cars, restrooms, sometimes not leaving their homes at all -- because they do not want to face the kind of public scrutiny that causes someone to file a complaint with managers and store owners about a woman breastfeeding in a public place.\"By encouraging other moms to participate in PBAP photo sessions or follow the project's Facebook page, she hopes they will gain the confidence to nurse in public. Rogers would also like her images to reach non-parents. \"My hope is that seeing these images will help desensitize them, or even reprogram their thinking that breasts are sexual and that breastfeeding is an extension of that. It's not,\" she said.\"Perhaps you haven't witnessed a mother breastfeeding in public before,\" she continued. \"You're not sure what you would do if you happened to turn the corner in the grocery store and run right into a mother juggling her life with a breastfeeding child in tow. These images also serve the purpose of positive, gentle exposure.\"Keep scrolling for a sample of the beautiful images of mothers nursing their babies in public from photographers across the globe.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Parts of Drought-Stricken California Are Sinking", "text": "By Don WilllmottCalifornia's multi-year drought may be old news by now, but it keeps yielding new surprises, such as nasty cracks appearing overnight in living room walls. As the state thirstily sucks groundwater from underground aquifers, especially to keep its massive agriculture industry operational, the people up above are feeling the ramifications and are beginning to crack -- literally -- under the pressure.As a local news report from San Francisco noted in late June, California's Central Valley and Merced County specifically, is suffering the most as a huge and longstanding subsidence zone centered around the town of El Nido may now be sinking at a rate of up to one foot per year, wreaking havoc on parking lots, concrete canal walls and most scarily, the foundations of residents' homes.Subsidence is actually a problem that goes back to earlier drought cycles. Reveal News recently recounted a short history of San Luis Obispo and how it came to cause its own geological downfall. In 1989, the city responded to a severe drought by drilling for water. Within a year, 40 percent of the local water supply was being obtained from an aquifer. The result: the Bear Valley Shopping Center began to buckle and crack, and salesmen at the nearby Sunset Honda dealership had to avoid flying glass as windows shattered under the pressure. (Eventually the building was demolished and replaced.)California's Central Valley has a sinking feeling. (Source: United States Geographical Survey, November 2013)The big question that emerged at the time was legal: who could sue whom for damages? Property owners sued the city and ultimately won $3.5 million in settlements, with the judge ruling that the city should have understood the dangers of droughts and prepared for them years earlier without resorting to desperate drilling measures.Today, San Luis Obispo has learned its lesson and no longer drills -- but just about everyone else does. California currently gets 60 percent of its water from groundwater sources, and with the legal precedent now in place, it's easy to predict the flurry of lawsuits that will be triggered if the severe subsidence in the Central Valley continues.And as you might imagine, this story extends far beyond the borders of the Golden State. A worldwide study published in June presented a \"groundwater stress assessment\" that quantified the relationship between groundwater use and availability in the world's 37 largest aquifer systems, everywhere from China to France. By using NASA satellite data to detect the gravitational pull of underground water, scientists found that 21 of the 37 systems have tipped into the negative zone -- they are losing more water than they can replace -- and 13 of them, including aquifer systems along America's Gulf coast and in the Indus River basin and Saudi Arabia, are in especially dire straits.UPDATE: A new NASA report just released by California's Department of Water Resources shows land in the state's San Joaquin Valley is sinking faster than ever before -- nearly two inches per month in some locations.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org; follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+; and get our newsletter to stay informed.Don Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites."}, {"title": "'Strange Looking' Pup Finds The Perfect Family", "text": "When Lisa first arrived at the Humane Society of Silicon Valley (HSSV) in Milpitas, California, she was, as shelter staff put it, \"unusual-looking.\" The tiny, 10-week-old puppy already had scars all over her face and a case of \"cherry-eye,\" or inflamed eyelids, that required surgery to correct it. \"She could be hard to look at,\" HSSV's Finnegan Dowling told The Dodo."}, {"title": "Sea of Japan Becoming a Dumping Ground for Trash From China and South Korea", "text": "Ever since the discovery of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch about 25 years ago, there have been ever-increasing efforts to prevent trash - especially plastics - from entering the oceans and the waterways that feed them. So when Japanese officials recently reported that over 15,000 plastic containers had washed ashore, mostly from neighboring South Korea and China, since January of this year, there was some obvious call for alarm. To make matters worse, some containers were labeled \"hazardous\" or \"oxidizing agent,\" and bore chemical symbols for hydrogen peroxide solution and nitric acid. On top of that, beach cleanup crews discovered almost 1,000 butane cigarette lighters in the debris.Clearly whatever measures Japan's neighbors have been taking to stem the flow of trash into the ocean have yet to be effective. According to a Wall Street Journal article from earlier this year, China is the world's largest producer of marine debris, followed by Indonesia. According to their study, the coastal population of China generated 8.82 million metric tons of mismanaged plastic waste in 2010, about 27.7% of the world total. Of that, between 1.32 million and 3.53 million metric tons ended up as marine debris. In the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa, approximately 80% of beach detritus is from China.From 2010 to 2013, when Japan's Environment Ministry collected data from field surveys to identify the source of the debris, approximately 50% had come from South Korea, with the other 50% being split between Japan and China. Of the 15,000 plastic bottles collected this year, a third of them have originated in South Korea. Another study by the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, indicates that South Korea is responsible for 85% of the refuse that washes ashore on the Japanese coasts. The Japanese government disposes of 100,000 tons of seaside trash annually. This trash is reaching as far as the coast line of Kyushu Island to the north and western parts of Honshu Island. These coastal areas are facing the Sea of Japan and the local Japanese people are working had to clean-up of the drifted debris. Unfortunately though in the last few years South Korea has been spending its time trying to get the name of the sea changed to 'East Sea' while there are more important issues at hand with the state of the environment.Ironically, one of the suspected contributors to the problem is an industry long known for its mild environmental impact: seaweed farming. Edible seaweed is grown on ropes that are stretched just below the surface of the water in rows and seeded. After harvesting the seaweed, the ropes are cleaned with a disinfectant before being re-seeded. If the plastic jug of disinfectant isn't properly disposed of it's likely to end up on Japan's beaches.According to Seafoodwatch.org, South Korean fisheries and aquaculture are usually regulated by fishing village cooperatives that lease farming sites to individuals for \"unspecified aquaculture,\" resulting in a lack of regulation and enforcement of aquaculture activities from higher levels of government. Also, if the coastal seaweed farmers lack recycling or trash collection alternatives generally provided by municipal governments, it's easy to see how the ocean might be viewed as a convenient dump. Considering that roughly 90% of Korean seaweed, both Undaria (known as miyeok in Korean, wakame in Japanese) and Pyropia (gim in Korean, nori in Japanese) is grown on the country's southernmost shores, Japan's western beaches would be the first stop for any seagoing debris, floating with the northerly Kuroshio current. Similarly, trash that enters the Yellow Sea from China's shores hitches a ride to Japan on the same prevailing currents, which are often likened to the Gulf Stream in the eastern U.S. because they transport warm water northward.While nobody wants trash washing up on their beaches, it is probably preferable to having it get caught up in one of the ocean's many gyres, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Once trash gets caught in the giant circular currents of the gyres it is far more difficult to remove than beach trash. Plastics are particularly troublesome. According to a 2014 National Geographic study, there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 269,000 tons floating around in the world's oceans today. The Ocean Cleanup cites some staggering impacts:Plastic is estimated to take up to 450 years to biodegrade. Meanwhile, small plastic particles sometimes referred to as \"nurdles,\" act as toxic sponges, soaking up oil, gas, chemical and other poisons. Once in the food chain, the toxins bio-accumulate, resulting in even higher concentrations inside fish. According to the NOAA, nurdles have already been found in small fish, plankton, shellfish and sea birds, and it's only a matter of time until toxins find their way into our seafood dinners.In Japan, the immediate problem is rapidly overwhelming both cleanup manpower and waste management facilities. While Japanese scientists investigate ways to turn plastic into an energy source, global organizations like the Ocean Conservancy, The Surfrider Foundation, the NOAA and national groups like Japan's Environment Ministry are actively engaged in cleanup operations year round. One such group, Dutch-registered nonprofit organization The Ocean Cleanup, has developed a trash collector which promises to clean up the world's oceans in just 5 years, beginning in 2016.Regardless of whether the trash is gathered at sea or from the beaches, there remains the thorny question of what to do with it. Japan has a reputation for being obsessed with cleanliness: citizens carefully sort their garbage into burnable, non-burnable and recyclable bins. At sporting events, spectators are expected to pack their trash out with them, sort it, and dispose of it at home. Nonetheless, much of the trash found on Japanese beaches originates elsewhere in Japan. What is the more important issue here: cleaning up the sea and making sure it isn't polluted further or changing its name? Governmental officials from South Korea and Japan are scheduled to discuss the issue in the coming months."}, {"title": "Young Kenyan Sees Permaculture Seeding Peace", "text": "\"There are only two options. To be the person who is making positive change or to support the one who is making positive change.\"This was one of the first things Yongo Otieno Wycliffe said to me, peering through a smeared video image with bare, yellowed walls towering behind him. I was impressed by how, at only age 23, his wisdom spoke loudest against the stark background.\"I am fascinated with nature and sustainable development. I'm attached to creating change and passionately involved with the care of this earth.\"That fascination has lead to a visionary plan for Yongo's community in Kitale, western Kenya. The beginning: a small plot of land sprouting from the basics of permaculture. An organic community garden that feeds the bellies and minds of some 200 locals, giving them sustenance, skills and purpose so they won't turn to gangs, drugs and prostitution.It's a lofty goal to shift things around for these villagers who battle extreme poverty and have a \"zero\" diet. They survive by growing and eating genetically modified corn, heavily laden with pesticides. They know nothing about crop rotation or working with natural cycles to restore nutrients in the soil. They shelter themselves, usually 12 people at a time, inside a one-room house with no resources for something better.Seeing his enthusiasm for helping others, American Michele Peele paid for Yongo's studies at the Permaculture Research Institute in Kenya, so he could learn the basics and teach others in his community about sustainable gardening. As a permaculture expert herself, she says sustainable practices are no longer an option-- for any of us.\"Employing permaculture principles and growing food sustainably could feed the world. It could minimize the effects of drought. Certainly permaculture makes it possible to conserve water and grow a greater variety of plants. The organic/permaculture movement is growing but not nearly as fast as it needs to grow to save us from the disastrous effects of pollution and global warming.\"There's been some progress in Kitale already. Yongo and a small dedicated group have raised enough funds to to buy a plot of land (50 meters by 100 meters) that's already producing small crops. There's also a guesthouse for anyone to stay for free while offering expertise in building, agricultural, clean water collection, peacemaking and even renewable energy such as biogas and solar-- skills that will be greatly needed if they're to expand.Yongo also envisions an educational institute or center for peace where everyone, including members of the surrounding 42 tribes,  some warring, can take workshops and learn to grow their own organic food. He sees this demonstration center as a gathering place that will give jobs to unemployed youths, will educate people on how to care for themselves and will even support children to grow creative talents such as singing, dancing and making art. He calls this, the S.H.A.R.E. Program: Sustainable Housing, Agriculture, Reaching Everyone.Most people in Kitale know Yongo's vision and support it, especially the children. He spends a lot of time visiting schools and spreading the word about sustainable agriculture. He also organizes tree-planting events, as well as dancing and running competitions.In his mind, life is inter-related this way. Permaculture is not just a way to feed people, he says. It has the ability to bring people together and create peace, not just between tribal members but also within individuals themselves."}, {"title": "The Connection Between Tourism and Elephant Abuse in India", "text": "India is said to have the best wildlife protection laws in the world. And it's partly true: the country's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 is benchmark legislation for the protection of wildlife--a global model. At least in words, anyway; actual enforcement of the law has been a different story altogether. One case in point is the horrific plight of captive elephants in India, and the devastating effect it's having on the vulnerable remaining wild populations there. This is an incredibly serious problem--and it's one that many tourists and members of the Indian public are fully enabling, likely without even knowing it.Author Liz Jones recently published an expose on the topic entitled \"Tortured for Tourists\" in the Daily Mail, one of the U.K.'s largest newspapers. We're all too familiar with the conditions that Jones describes: frequent beatings and mutilation, malnutrition and dehydration, and literal years of confinement in tiny spaces are just a few of the hardships captive elephants in India endure. Still, it's heartbreaking to read another account of elephants being intentionally blinded or having bones broken for \"disciplinary\" purposes, of these incredible creatures being stripped of their freedom and drained of their vitality for a quick profit. Whether young or old, capable or lame, none of these elephants are shown mercy. They suffer at the hands of a keeper (or mahout) until they die, and that is their lot in life. This is the tragic norm in a country with one of the greatest wildlife protection acts in the world.Lack of public knowledge is one factor here, and that's partially to do with inadequate publicity. Although the unprecedented killing of elephants in Africa has been well documented--and deservedly so; the population depletions and mass graves there should have everyone's attention--the equally alarming situation for Asian elephants has been woefully under-publicized. The shock evident in the reaction of Daily Mail readers underscores the desperate need for greater awareness. Most readers had no idea. They may have even ridden an elephant in India, as the author confesses, without any knowledge that this practice contributes directly to the suffering endured by elephants on a daily basis, behind the curtain of traditional secrets, in grim training camps and punitive \"corrective\" facilities, even at temples.Whenever a story like Jones' comes out, we receive a chorus of questions from horrified readers. \"Why does this happen?\" \"What can be done to stop it?\"These questions can be addressed by acknowledging the primitive notion of animals as entertainment. If the public at large would show the same disdain and horror for the Asian elephant-riding industry--and the senseless brutality behind the scenes that makes Asian elephants \"rideable\"--as we do for killing African elephants for ivory, the lucrative business of torturing elephants for human amusement would halt. People are simply not making a connection between a selfie on Facebook riding an elephant and a life of misery for the animal. But it's a very real connection. With education will come outrage, and with enough outrage maybe change.As we mentioned, the problem doesn't end with captive elephants in India, either. A significant portion of these elephants are being pulled from the wild to fulfill the demand. More than 95% of India's wild elephants have been exterminated over the last century. The plummeting population numbers can't dwindle much further before we can call it complete annihilation. To protect and conserve wild populations, we need to protect the already-captive ones, and for that we need a change in thinking, one that does away with the old notion that animals are here to entertain us.As a start, every captive elephant should be treated humanely, have basic nutrition, and be allowed freedom of movement. The knowledge is there, the laws have been passed, but 95% of India's captive elephants are no better off for it. Finding the collective will to end the barbaric treatment of these amazing beings is critical, and that starts with understanding the issues at stake.Articles like \"Tortured by Tourists\" should bring greater publicity to the cruelty these animals face every day. And we believe that once people know what's going on, they will be moved to act--at the very least cancel any plans to ride an elephant and spread the word about these secret practices. In the meantime, we can urge governmental officials to enforcing existing wildlife laws, so that elephants are protected, as they should be .

Scorched. Burnt. Words not typically used to describe the Arctic. Over 400 lightning-caused fires have burned more than 5 million acres in Alaska this summer -- an area larger than the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined and five times the number of acres burned in all the other states in the United States this year.On August 7, Alaska's fire season was officially declared the second largest since records began 76 years ago. 192 fires are still burning. This is not the first time that fires have severely scorched Alaska, but this year is notable because it is the third time within this century that fires have ravaged the tundra and boreal forests, causing millions of acres to ignite. In 2004, 6.6 million acres burned, ranking first for most acres burned in the state. Theoretically, that was a once in 50 year event. But the following year, flames consumed 4.7 million acres making 2005 another devastating fire season, far exceeding the annual average of 1 million acres.Our Earth's life support system reduced to numbers. These environmental records -- quantifying and categorizing every facet of our human life-dependent ecosystems -- smashed, shattered, broken. How to describe this trajectory of environmental transformation? The data speaks the truth, and the truth is climate change is happening, and is happening faster than we thought.Fires are a normal part of the Arctic ecosystem and contribute to habitat vitality and renewal. But the fires currently burning are different. Record-high temperatures, a record-low snow season and an unimaginable number of lightning strikes, 46,000 in three days in June, created the conflagration that has lasted more than two months. Normally, approximately 110,000 lightning strikes occur during Alaska's summer.Two arctic tundra fires in Southwest Alaska started this year's fire season. Tundra covers the northern and western reaches of Alaska where there are few trees and the subsoil -- called permafrost -- is always frozen. Tundra becomes soft squishy water-logged Earth during the summer when the top layer of the soil thaws. Short plants, a few inches above the ground and resistant to cold, are the primary vegetation. Intact, the organic soil insulates the permafrost. Tundra stores huge amounts of carbon that is hundreds to thousands of years old. Decreased precipitation, specifically snow, has parched the tundra. The largest tundra fire in recorded history occurred in 2007 north of the Arctic Circle -- the fire burned for almost three months and marked the first time fire had burned in the area in at least 5,000 years. The tundra fire of 2007 released as much carbon as the tundra had stored in the previous 50 years. Carbon once stored now adds to the carbon emissions warming our planet.The human impact of these fires is severe. Engulfed by smoke for weeks in June and July, health warnings told people to avoid going outside. Aniak, Chuathbaluk, Tanana, Hughes, Napaimute, Crow Village -- they are the names of some of the dozens of indigenous Alaska Native villages surrounded by flames. No roads connect these villages to safety. Located along the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, the navigable rivers of Alaska's interior where people hunt and fish, access to these villages is typically only by small 10-seat passenger planes. In July, the smoke was so thick flights could not always evacuate residents so evacuations occurred by boat. In July, more than one dozen fires surrounded the village of Tanana. Some communities have been threatened by fire since June.Driving north of Fairbanks, interior Alaska's largest community, in the middle of July, several plumes of smoke rise. Black bruises stain the forested mountain slopes. A fire crew rests by the side of the road, one of several brought from outside of Alaska to combat the danger. Trained fire crews, however, have not been sufficient to respond to the wildfires. The use of military personnel has been essential.These fires not only threaten lives, but are another signal of dramatic ecosystem changes caused by a warming planet. Scholars struggle to create a climate model that can accurately predict these changes. But this complex web of non-linear environmental change is hard to quantify. Fire releases not only carbon into the atmosphere but ash, which is now believed to be accelerating the melting of Greenland's massive ice sheet. The black ash now covers white ice -- the white is essential to reflect the sun's radiation back into the atmosphere. Instead, the black increases the Earth's absorption of heat from the sun. We are witnessing the fast forward of geologic time.On August 31, President Obama will travel to Alaska for a historic visit and speak at a climate change conference hosted by the U.S. State Department. His visit offers Alaskans a tremendous opportunity to share the beauty of our state and these alarming changes, adding his voice to the urgent need for action to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions and also adapt.

While regulation of methane is a necessity, these rules are much too weak to accomplish the administration's goals of meaningful greenhouse gas reduction. Here is why:Methane must be regulated, but the new rules underestimate its power.Methane is 86-105 times as powerful as CO2 at disrupting the climate over a 20-year period. The EPA and many news organizations misreport the real power of methane by using old science since updated by the IPCC. Obama's new rules calculate that methane is 25 times more powerful than CO2 over a 100-year timeline. However, this ignores the fact that methane is most potent when it is first released. Scientists say that methane could push the climate over a \"tipping point\" in the next 18-25 years, causing runaway global warming, and making a 100-year timeline obsolete. In order to take the threat from methane seriously, we must join the IPCC and assess methane's threat on a time scale that makes sense in the context of avoiding catastrophic climate change.Craig Sautner lights a plastic jug of water from his well on fire. Methane from nearby hydraulic fracturing natural gas drilling has contaminated his water supplyThe oil and gas industry, especially the frackers, are the largest industrial methane polluter.It is undisputed that the oil and gas industry is the largest industrial emitter of methane. A recent study of the major gas producing shales found that the Barnett Shale around Dallas was leaking the equivalent of 16[1] coal plants worth of green house gases every year. Similar studies from Colorado found that highly fracked areas leaked more than 19 tons of methane an hour.But we don't actually know how much the oil and gas industry is emitting.The Obama administration's new rules are aimed at reducing methane 40- 45% from 2005 levels. Unfortunately, no one really knows how much methane the oil and gas industry pumped into the atmosphere in 2005. The EPA figures that the administration's rules rely on are based on numbers self reported by the industry. These numbers are almost certainly a fraction of actual total methane emissions. Recent studies that use planes to determine methane emissions from oil and gas operations have found much higher rates of pollution than the industry or the EPA will currently admit.For example, a study released this August found that natural-gas gathering facilities, which collect methane from fracked wells, lose about 100 billion cubic feet of gas every year - eight times more than the EPA estimates.A Stanford report concluded that there is already about 50 percent more methane in the atmosphere than previously estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency.The New York Times recently reported that the creator of the technology commonly used to measure methane emissions by the oil and gas industry thinks his invention is not accurate the way the industry and some research groups use it, and is missing a huge portion of the pollution actually released by the industry.These rules won't cut enough methane.These regulations are based on old science that misrepresents the impact of methane on the climate. The aim of the new rules is to reduce methane emissions 40-45% of an imaginary number - an underestimation of 2005 emissions. On top of that, they are only aimed at new sources, ignoring the nearly one million fracked wells and associated infrastructure that already exist in the United States. Real and meaningful reductions in methane must be made to reach the president's global warming goals, and they have to better than these.[1] The new EDF paper finds that the Barnett leaks 76 ± 13 Mg CH4 hr−1 76 tons per hour, times 8765.81 hours/year = 666201.56 x 85 (Co2 eq/20 yrs) = 56,627,132.6 co2e per year - or equal to about 16 average coal plants. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.5b02305"}, {"title": "WATCH: Brother and Sister Duo Empower Kids to Protect the Environment", "text": "Carter and Olivia Ries wanted to make a difference.

Photo by Brian Milne.Dirty Heads and Slighty Stoopid might be touring together for the first time this summer, but they have more than music on their minds during the Everything is Awesome Tour.The Southern California-based bands are not only set on getting fans out of their seats during the shows, but they want to raise awareness for a pair of worthy causes as well.Dirty Heads has teamed up with Oxfam to raise awareness around world hunger and poverty, while Slightly Stoopid has partnered with the Surfrider Foundation to help conserve the coastline in California and beyond.“When we wrote the song \"Sound of Change\", we felt that would be a cool name for the album,” said Jared “Dirty J” Watson of Dirty Heads. “Then we kind of got to talking, and the discussions were like, \"Yo, if we're going to talk about change, maybe we should start working with an organization that walks the walk and talks the talk.\"“We're fortunate to have a platform, and we have very loyal fans. People are willing to listen to what we have to say, so we’ve decided to put our money where our mouth is and are actively working on something to help affect change.”Sounding Off on Coastal ConservationEarlier this year, an oil spill in Refugio, Calif., rocked Santa Barbara County, where Sunday’s show was held at the Santa Barbara Bowl.To help raise awareness about coastal concerns on the Central Coast and Southern California, Slightly Stoopid invited both the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara chapters of Surfrider to participate in the event.With 50,000 members and 90 chapters globally, Surfrider is a non-profit, grassroots organization dedicated to preserving beaches, waves and the ocean.“The ocean is one of the most important commodities we have on this earth,” said Slightly Stoopid’s Miles Doughty. “From recreational use, to needing it for food, for culture, it’s just something you really have to protect.”Doughty said Surfrider is an easy organization to back because much of the Ocean Beach-based group grew up surfing.Their latest music video for The Prophet was shot overlooking the beaches near San Diego, and when their current tour wraps they’re planning to play a surf expo in Tahiti later this year.Mark Morey, chair of Surfrider’s Santa Barbara Chapter, says the “stakes are high” closer to the Santa Barbara Bowl where the Refugio Oil Spill occurred on May 19, with as much as 143,000 gallons of crude spilling from a Plains All American Pipeline onto the Gaviota Coast. Morey said the chapter is working to ensure Plains All American is held accountable for the “grossly negligent act,” as well as protect the same scenic coastline from being lost to development.“Preaching to the choir only gets you so far,” Morey said. “Working with this band gives us greater visibility to raise awareness in groups that are outside of the environmental community. No one wants dirty beaches. But if you knew how tenuous their position was, you might be motivated to act.”Morey added that concert and festival invites from bands such as Slightly Stoopid, allows non-profits like Surfrider to reach a broader audience despite a lack of resources.“We have to choose our battles due to limited resources,” Morey said. “That is why recruiting volunteers is critical. If our capitalist system wasn't so focused on destroying the planet for money, our job would be much easier.”With a tour schedule that still includes stops from Live Oak, Fla., to Puerto Morelos, Mexico, Doughty admits he no longer surfs as much as he used to. But earlier this week, during a rare day off in Southern California, he was able to carve out some time to surf with his daughter.Those moments, he said, are what inspire the group to work with organizations like Surfrider to ensure the coastline remains intact for the next generation.“Surfrider has done a hell of a job,” Doughty said. “It’s not an easy thing to do, kind of taking on the corporate world. We’re stoked to have them come to shows, and promote awareness for their organization with the youth of today. They’re the ones who are going to be taking over this country, and have to deal with what’s going on at our beaches.”Sounding Off on World HungerDirty Heads has been working with Oxfam, a global confederation of 17 organizations “working to right the wrongs of poverty, hunger and injustice.” Oxfam has helped Nepal’s Sindhupalchowk region bounce back from the April earthquake that killed more than 9,000 people and injured another 23,000 by constructing shelters for the homeless, as well as providing agricultural tools, hygiene supplies and emergency kits.\"When we met the Oxfam family we saw how active they were, and you can really see where the help is going,\" Watson said. \"I think there's a lot of talk in charity, and you never know how much actually gets done. With Oxfam, we know what gets done because they're very open with what's being done and very passionate about it.\"Dirty Heads has held VIP ticket fundraisers to benefit Oxfam, and is in discussions with the organization about selling branded merchandise or promoting products that raise awareness about world hunger and poverty.According to the Oxfam website, more than 20.7 million people directly benefited from Oxfam programs last year, including more than 660,000 villagers who now have access to savings and loan opportunities. Additionally, more than 240,000 activists have urged companies to fight climate change and support farmers through these programs.“At Oxfam America, we often say that ‘music can change the world,’ and we know that's true,” said Bob Ferguson, manager for Oxfam America’s creative alliances and music outreach.“I have seen the direct line between a band's fans being engaged at a concert and a hunger-related bill passing a Congressional vote, or water and sanitation being delivered to an earthquake stricken region. Music is an art of passion, and music fans are passionate about being helpful and kind. When musicians and music fans partner with Oxfam to turn that passion and kindness into action, the impact can be powerful and really can change the world.”The two bands at a recent show in Colorado. Photo via @slightlystoopid.Joining Forces on StageIn terms of touring for the first time together, both of the bands’ frontmen said it's been a blast and they're excited their tour schedules finally aligned.Until this year, the Southern California bands with similar roots had never toured together, and had only played on an occasional festival lineup.\"When you tour with Slightly Stoopid, it's like summer camp,\" Watson said. \"... Everybody knows we're just out there trying to have fun, party and keep the fans happy. It's been cool. We've been getting up there, playing music with them, doing a couple songs, and it's been really fun. \"Doughty couldn’t agree more.\"It’s been fun traveling together, spreading our music to the world,\" Doughty said. \"We both come from Southern California, and there’s just a culture and a vibe about it. ... It’s definitely been a humbling experience, playing with these guys and raising awareness for some of the causes we’re passionate about.”"}, {"title": "We Were Born of the Land Lent to Us By Our Future Generations", "text": "By Nina GualingaI spend time with my people, by the side of my family in the heart of the Ecuadorian Amazon. I play with the children that, full of happiness and curiosity, run barefoot, eat what they find in the forest and bathe in the big river without the permission of their parents. At the same time, I remember my childhood in that green rainforest full of life, which has so influenced my own journey. I'm on the same journey that many of our ancestors and parents have walked to fight for the wellbeing of our generation.Our fight as indigenous peoples began a long time ago, when the colonizers arrived to our land to take over our resources and remove us from our homes with the invitation and support of the government of that time. Therefore, we carried out the indigenous uprising in 1992, organized by the indigenous movement with its affiliated organizations across the country. With the leadership of the OPIP (Indigenous Peoples Organization of the Pastaza River), we took the necessary force to take to the streets. Indigenous peoples were tired of living under discrimination and oppression in their own land. Thousands of people walked from the Amazon to the capital Quito, demanding from the authorities recognition as ancestral peoples and land titles for their ancestral territories, among other demands. This was a great victory for the dignity and the life of us indigenous peoples.This crucial historic event happened just a year before I was born. My mother participated in the march together with the majority of our family. Some of my family formed part of the OPIP and were key actors in the organization and implementation of this march. Elders, children, women and men walked in the cold of the mountains and the burning sun, with bloodied feet from their long journey. With great conviction, the mothers marched arm-in-arm, carrying their babies at their breast and taking over the cities to get what they demanded.Today, twenty-three years later, indigenous peoples together with other social sectors have organized to once again demand that the government listens to the voices of the people and respect the fundamental rights that the Ecuadorian constitution guarantees. Marching are mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, grandparents from the rainforest, from the mountains, from the cities, from the communities - all those really in touch with the Earth. These people are not defending any politician, any political party, any NGO, or any other interest beyond the right to defend their homes, their families, their values, and their right to live!This struggle is very clear as we feel the same deception and frustration of seeing the incompetence of our government to exercise its entrusted role. In other words, their responsibility to lead and serve the Ecuadorian people. Just as during the time of the first uprising in 1992, this government has ignored the petitions and the demands of the people.As human beings we have a right to freedom of choice. Under this government, we have lost even the right to express our opinions without running the risk of being put in jail. We are living under a regime that terrorizes the population so it can maintain power. How many leaders, students, and journalists, how many protestors, how many organizations and how many human rights defenders have been threatened or even detained and sentenced for only the act of defending fundamental rights? This is not a democracy that guarantees us our Constitution or international laws and treaties that Ecuador has signed.We can't deny the good things that this government has done, for which it was elected by the people. But that fact simply does NOT justify the violations of human rights committed during these eight years. The people of Ecuador are tired of so much abuse of their fundamental rights. We demand immediate change, starting with the right to freedom of expression and the press, to stop and sanction the misuse of public funds, to halt extractive activities in Yasuní and stop the expansion of the oil frontiers in the south-central Ecuadorian Amazon, to stop the indefinite reelection of the President, the immediate release of all human rights defenders who have been unfairly judged, and to end discrimination and public humiliation of women through mass media and other means.To dismiss this march and this uprising with the argument that it was organized by corrupt leaders of organizations is to dismiss all those who elected those leaders as our representatives. And it is important to mention that some of these leaders - those who have fought for many years and even participated in the 1992 march - have remained firm in their positions and have served their people with honor and without abandoning their values and principles in exchange for money or other luxuries.Additionally, to say that this uprising does not have grassroots support of the communities and that it is an attempt of destabilization on behalf of the Right Wing is an insult to all of the people who have fought for their homes, for their lives, and for their dignity! The base communities, the indigenous peoples, the distinct social sectors of the country are the ones who are present. By ignoring the needs of the country and of the people and - even worse, by insulting and dismissing us - the President is committing a big mistake.Because, Mr. Rafael Correa: As much as you are the President and as much as you hide behind a battalion of police and military, the crude reality of our country will catch up to you sooner or later.It is the children that play in the jungle, in the mountains and on the city streets that are our future. They are the future of our country, and it is today's reality that will pave their future path. As such, we have to take care of them and the places where they are growing and learning as human beings.For this and much more I'd like to ask everyone - youth, women, men, mothers, fathers, students, professors, workers, and everyone else: Let's lift up our voices and fight for the future of all those children who will one day take the helm to create a better tomorrow!Daughter of the first uprising, Nina GualingaOriginal statement has been translated from Spanish."}, {"title": "Even Indoor Cats Can Be Exposed to Lawn Chemicals", "text": "If you have a cat -- especially one that never goes outdoors -- you may not give much thought to the dangers that lawn chemicals can pose for your feline companion. But if you, your homeowners association or your neighbors use fertilizers, pesticides or other chemicals in your yard, your kitty may be exposed to these toxic agents in ways you never even considered.Obviously, if your cat spends some or most of her time outside (which I don't recommend for the sake of her safety and health), there's a good chance she'll absorb lawn chemicals through her paws, or ingest them when she grooms or nibbles grass or other outdoor plants.But there's another way your cat can be exposed even if she never steps foot outside. The potentially toxic chemicals found in lawn fertilizers and pesticides come indoors on the shoes of humans and the paws and coats of dogs. Common chemicals found in herbicides, including 2,4-D and dicamba, are easily tracked indoors where they contaminate the air and surfaces inside your home, exposing your kitty to dangerously high levels of these toxins.Symptoms of Lawn Chemical PoisoningSigns that your cat may have been exposed to toxic lawn chemicals include drooling, tearing of the eyes, excessive urination, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, muscle twitching, difficulty breathing, unsteady gait and collapse.However, cats exposed to toxic chemicals may not exhibit obvious signs of poisoning, and in fact, sometimes insecticides cause the opposite of the listed symptoms, but there is usually some indication the cat is not well. If you suspect your kitty has been exposed to insecticides, you should remove him from the toxic environment and seek medical attention as soon as possible.If your cat exhibits any of the listed symptoms and there's even a remote possibility he's been exposed to lawn chemicals, you should seek immediate veterinary care for your pet.Chronic exposure to phenoxy herbicides like 2,4-D can affect your cat's liver, kidneys, GI tract, and muscles. Exposure to pesticides containing chlorophyenoxy acids can result in anemia, and low white blood cell and platelet counts.Keeping Your Cat Safe from Lawn Chemicals and Other Toxic PesticidesThe best way to protect your kitty from the toxins in lawn chemicals is to use natural and organic alternatives that are not only safer for pets and humans, but also the environment. Unfortunately, even if you don't use chemicals in your yard, if your neighbors do, the products can blow onto your property from neighboring properties.If your cat goes outside, even within the confines of a secure outdoor enclosure, you should consider keeping him indoors during the time of year when lawn fertilizers and pesticides are typically in use.Develop the habit of removing your shoes outside the door to prevent tracking residual chemicals inside your home. And wipe off the paws of your indoor/outdoor cat daily, especially during the summer months.Keep in mind that most flea and tick preventives are pesticides, whether they are spot-on treatments, pills, dips, solutions, shampoos or collars. The EPA has called for new labeling requirements for spot-on products, but tragically, cats continue to die from misuse of these products. It's important to remember that just because a compound is applied to or worn on a pet's fur doesn't mean it's safe. What goes on your pet goes in your pet, by absorption through the skin or ingestion during grooming.Alternatives to Chemical Insecticides and FertilizersIf insects are wreaking havoc in your garden, consider using a garden hose with a nozzle to get rid of them safely. Many of the insects that commonly infest gardens have soft bodies and can be eliminated with a spray of water. Try hosing down your garden twice daily for a week to resolve the problem. If that doesn't do the trick, add a little dish soap to plain water and spray the garden again. You might also want to consider a product I've found very helpful in managing resistant garden pests called Pyola.You can fertilize your lawn and garden using compost applied twice a year. Create a compost pile and apply biannually to your lawn and garden. The compost will add essential nutrients to the soil without the use of chemicals, making your property safe for your cat.Dr. Karen Becker is a proactive and integrative wellness veterinarian.

Earlier this month, a grizzly bear known as Blaze (after a light-colored marking on her flank) was killed inside Yellowstone Park. The reasons differ; Blaze killed a hiker. At the time, Blaze had cubs with her. Park authorities killed Blaze. Her cubs will go to a zoo. You can see photos of Blaze with an earlier cub here. Here are my thoughts:No serious person trivializes the tragic loss of the hiker. Killing the bear, though, could not bring the hiker back. Nor does killing Blaze ensure safety for hikers; there are other bears with cubs in Yellowstone. The Park administrators must have had liability on their minds; if the same bear hurt someone else: lawsuit. But we can have safe hiking and we can keep bears safe: where bears live, the Park Service should require hikers to carry bear spray.Grizzlies with cubs can be unpredictable, anywhere from mellow to murderous. I've back-packed in Yellowstone and hiked in heavy bear country in Alaska where I frequently saw bears, and in British Columbia watched mother grizzlies with cubs on a shoreline at very close range from a small boat. In the two cases where I most closely observed mothers with cubs, the mothers were preoccupied with concern about male bears--which sometimes kill cubs. They weren't concerned about us.Mother bringing cubs to where we are gathered. Photo: Carl SafinaRight onto the log I'm sitting on. Photo: Carl SafinaIn the case while we were in the little boat a few yards from shore, the mother--who was well-known by our guide--had detected a male somewhere down the beach and was highly vigilant about him, not us. In the other case, I and about a dozen colleagues watched as a mother with three cubs traveled about a mile on an Alaskan tidal flat to get away from a male. When the male disappeared into high sedges, the mother brought her cubs onto the log I was sitting on, apparently because she felt safer in a crowd of humans than out in the open on her own. In that case, being close to us actually seemed to let her (though not all of us) relax.Her attention is ahead, not on us. Photo: Carl SafinaWhen we go into bear country, we know that a mother bear's main concern is her cubs' safety. Leaving the safety of our cars (to the extent that driving is \"safe\"), we know we are trading the risks of traffic for bears and other risks. I and many others would say this: I would never want a bear who killed me to be killed, and I'd gladly sign waivers stating so. I would not trek into bear country without pepper spray; that's my responsibility to myself, my family, other hikers, administrators--and the bears.That the man hiked in bear country, and alone, was his choice. That he hiked without pepper spray was his fault, putting himself and the bears at risk. I mean no disrespect to him or his family when I point out that fully understanding the importance of being properly equipped can potentially save more hikers than can killing a bear after a hiker is killed. Here's the story of one couple and how they survived what would have been an ugly attack by a charging mother grizzly because they carried pepper spray--and had practiced using it. Their competence saved them--and the bear and her cub.Worried about a male, not us. Photo: Carl SafinaPhotographer Amy Gerber watched Blaze for years. She was quoted as saying: \"She raised five litters of cubs along the road... where [males] won't come. ...You watch the way she raised her young, watch her with her babies - She's a great mother and she's an amazing bear,\" said Gerber. \"Thousands upon thousands have seen her and taken her picture over the years. She's that bear that is like the ambassador for everything good... This is a bear that co-existed for 20 years with people and [had]... never shown aggressive tendencies. She's never been a problem.\"So, where does this lead? Yellowstone is a park. Parks are managed for people. But people go to Yellowstone for nature and wildlife, and in a shrinking world Yellowstone is crucial wildlife habitat. African parks generally do not allow people on foot at all. If we want people to risk only auto-injuries and not wildlife injuries, we too could also keep everyone in our cars. But many of us want a deeper, more intimate experience. Yet all of us prefer to come out alive.Luckily there's a way for us to have it both ways: be properly equipped. Poorly equipped people spread their risk to bears. Then when there's an incident, it forces other people to make sad decisions. Killing a bear known as a great mother, who'd felt protective about her cubs, has multiplied this recent Yellowstone tragedy.It doesn't have to be this way. The simplest answer is: the Park Service should require all hikers in bear country to carry bear spray, and strongly advise people not to be alone. If that were the policy, fewer people and fewer bears would die. Win-win. Simple enough."}, {"title": "The Path from Personal Transformation to Societal Change", "text": "Is human nature inherently egoistic or altruistic?Despite the violence and conflict that we constantly see in the media, studies show that violence has diminished continually over the past few centuries. Our everyday existence, too, is often filled with cooperation, friendship, affection and care.Scientific investigation over the last 30 years has increasingly shifted the distorted view of human nature as motivated wholly by selfishness, a belief that long-dominated Western psychology and theories of evolution and economics.I myself am deeply convinced that love and compassion--the two faces of altruism--are the cardinal virtues of human existence and the heart of the spiritual path. Loving kindness is the wish that all beings experience happiness, while compassion focuses on eradicating their suffering.My experiences with spiritual masters of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition over more than 45 years spent in Asia have influenced me profoundly. Particularly inspiring is the Buddhist conviction that every human being possesses an indestructible potential for goodness and wisdom. I have also learned valuable lessons by participating in humanitarian service, including some 140 medical and education projects in the Himalayan regions through Karuna-Shechen, the organization I founded.Our era is confronted with many challenges, among them the imperative of reconciling the demands of three time scales--short, middle and long-term, on which three types of interests are superimposed: ours, the interests of those close to us, and those of all sentient beings. In the short term, we must respond to the immediate demands of the present economy; in the middle term, the search for happiness; and in the long term, the future health of the environment.As for the environment, until recently its evolution has been measured in terms of geological and climatic eras, over millions of years. In our day, the rhythm of change keeps accelerating because of ecological upheavals provoked by human activities. In particular, the \"Great Acceleration\" that has occurred since 1950 has defined a new era, called the Anthropocene (\"era of humans\"), in which, for the first time in history, human activities are profoundly modifying (and currently degrading) the entire system that maintains life on earth.This completely new challenge has taken us by surprise. If our obsession with achieving quantitative growth continues, with consumption of natural resources increasing at its current exponential rate, we will need three planets by 2050. We don't have them.What can we do about this predicament? Only a revolutionary, unifying concept will lead us out of this complex maze of preoccupations. Over decades, my meetings with spiritual leaders, philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists, economists, and environmentalists have convinced me that altruism is the Ariadne's thread allowing us to connect harmoniously the challenges of the economy in the short term, quality of life in the mean term, and our future environment in the long term.In line with Darwin's emphasis on the importance of cooperation in nature, new advances in evolutionary theory allow us to envision an extended altruism that transcends the ties of family and tribe, and emphasizes the fact that human beings are essentially \"SuperCooperators,\" to use a term coined by Martin Nowak.Evaluating the capacities for both individual and collective transformation is important if we want to encourage the development for a more altruistic society and a better world.Thousands of years of contemplative practice attest to the power of individual transformation. This age-old wisdom has now been confirmed by neuroscience research showing that any form of training--such as learning to read or play an instrument--induces a restructuring in the brain, at both the functional and structural levels. The same kind of restructuring occurs when we cultivate benevolence and train in developing altruistic love and compassion.How do we go from personal transformation to societal change? Recent studies by theoreticians such as Richerson and Boyd, authors of Not by Genes Alone, stress the importance of the evolution of cultures, which is slower than individual evolution but much faster than genetic changes. Cultural evolution is cumulative, transmitted over generations by education and imitation. Cultures and individuals continue to influence each other mutually. Individuals who grow up in a new culture are different, because their new habits transform their brain through neuroplasticity, and the expression of their genes through epigenetics. These individuals contribute to the evolution of their culture and their institutions, so that this process is repeated in every generation. We can thus look forward to a welcome evolution toward more cooperative and altruistic societies.This ideal is well within our reach. Recent research has also shown that from early childhood we are wired to be cooperative and helpful. Even very young babies recognize kindness toward others and prefer it above mistreatment. At Paul Bloom's \"baby lab\" at Yale University, infants 6 to 10 months old were able to recognize kind behavior and show their preference for kindness over mistreatment. Similarly, the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig found young toddlers from the age of 12 months spontaneously exhibiting behavior of mutual aid and cooperation, without teaching by adults or any prospect of a reward.With this foundation, we can begin to promote a more altruistic society, by focusing on five points:  • We need to enhance cooperation, which includes favoring cooperative over competitive learning at school and within organizations.  • We need to aim at a sustainable harmony, which reduces inequalities and preserving our environment by doing more with less • We need to foster a caring economics. An economics driven by selfish interests cannot remedy poverty or care for the environment.  • We need local commitment with a sense of global responsibility.  • We need to extend altruism to other life forms--the 1.3 million catalogued species that are our co-citizens in this world.Altruism should not be relegated to the realm of noble utopian thinking maintained by a few big-hearted, naive people. On the contrary, it is a determining factor of the quality of our existence, now and to come. We must have the insight to recognize this and the audacity to proclaim it. The altruism revolution is on its way. Let us all be part of it.Photograph taken in Brittany, France, by the author."}, {"title": "U.S. Senators, Animal Group Fight To Stop Roundup Of Wild Horses In Arizona", "text": "(Reuters) - An animal rights group has filed a legal challenge to a planned roundup of wild horses in Arizona, arguing the government has failed to determine whether these horses actually need to be removed.Friends of the Animals sued the U.S. Forest Service on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona after the government issued a notice at the end of July authorizing the impoundment of horses in Tonto National Forest for up to a year.Classified by the Service as \"unauthorized livestock,\" these wild horses could be offered for sale and may end up slaughtered for meat, Friends of Animals said in their complaint.\"Actions to remove wild horses from the Tonto National Forest could have a significant effect on the surrounding environment and on the many people that study, view and document the herd,\" the group said in its complaint, noting that wild horses have roamed the area since at least 1890.Government roundups of wild horses often spur intense opposition from animal advocates and other conservation groups.U.S. Republican Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona, have also raised concerns about the roundup challenged in the complaint. The lawmakers sent a letter to the service in early August, asking the agency to hold off on gathering any horses until there has been \"sufficient public engagement.\"Friends of the Animals argue the government issued its impoundment notice in the Arizona Capitol Times on July 31 without any prior notice to the public.Under the federal Wild Horse Act, passed in 1971, the government can remove wild horses only if it determines that there is an overpopulation of horses in the specified area and the action is necessary to maintain an \"ecological balance.\"The animal group said the government did not offer any explanation about why the horses in Tonto National Forest were not covered by the Wild Horse Act.The government also did not undertake any analysis of the environmental impacts of the horse roundup, which is a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, according to the group.The Forest Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Artist Makes Giant Patchwork Hot Air Balloons From Recycled Bags", "text": "Argentine artist Tomás Saraceno has his head in the clouds.For his newest project, titled \"Becoming Aerosolar,\" Saraceno transformed thousands of recycled plastic bags into airy patchwork blobs, remodeling excess waste into an otherworldly vessel.Brightly colored corporate logos and generic gift bags morph into vibrant quilted strips that, when stitched together, resemble a shopping mall dumpster that got the Hayao Miyazaki treatment.

His earlier works include a multi-layered, netted web that turns viewers into mutant spiders, a cluster of insect-like shiny pods on the Met rooftop and a suspended clear film installation that allows visitors to defy the laws of gravity.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Yes, FreshDirect And Blue Apron Are Healthier Than Grocery Shopping", "text": "Gone are the days when \"food delivery\" was considered a nutritional no-no.Over the past few years, online meal kits including Blue Apron, Plated and Chef'd and grocery delivery services like FreshDirect, Instacart and Peapod have revolutionized the ways many Americans treat dinnertime. In a world where time is scarce and convenience is key, these methods of putting food on the table are majorly tempting for a lot of harried professionals.But while these services certainly cut down on time, you might not expect that they also trim your waistline, as a growing body of research suggests. That's because previous research has suggested that takeout is anathema to good health.However, as Shape recently reported, it's the portion-control aspect of gourmet meal services that makes them so diet-friendly. By only preparing a serving or two at a time without the excess ingredients that happen so often when you buy your own groceries, there's no worrying about the temptation to overeat.Earlier this year, a study from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that women who spend more time fixing their own meals from scratch are more likely to struggle with high blood pressure and increased blood sugar and triglyceride levels.“We assumed cooking at home would be healthier,” lead study author Brad Appelhans told Shape. “That’s not necessarily the case, however. When you’re making fabulous gourmet dishes from scratch, you may be tempted to eat more.”Grocery delivery is healthier, too. Placing an online order for a shopping list prevents those impulse buys that occur when you're roaming the supermarket aisles after work, starving and craving every sweet and savory treat in sight. Unlike in-person shopping, for which grocery chains have perfected the environmental psychology jiu jitsu that keeps people over-buying, there is no instant gratification in ordering a box of chocolate chip cookies via a website. So unless you know you really want them and are willing to wait for them, you're less likely to add them to your virtual shopping cart.A small study from the University of Connecticut monitored 28 women who bought groceries online from Peapod's service for eight weeks, and found that they were much more likely to stick to their shopping list and lose weight in the process.\"We found by using the online service people were really able to cut back on the amount of high fat foods they had in their home. So, reduced it by up to 40 percent,\" lead author Amy Gorin told NBC Connecticut. \"We also found the more times people used the ordering service the better their weight losses were, so there was an association there.\"There's something to be said for not having the option of buying food in bulk, either. In analyzing geographic body mass index data between 1990 and 2010, the National Bureau of Economic Research found a strong correlation between the number of box stores and warehouse-style food retailers and obesity rates in the surrounding area. Typically when people shop bargains, they buy more, and such stores are known for large quantities of processed food that contribute to weight gain.Delivery services, on the other hand, are particularly appealing to urban dwellers who lack time and easy access to these massive grocery stores, not to mention spacious kitchens. While such services can get rather pricey -- they're not the most economical choice for families -- and result in additional food packaging waste that is surely no benefit to the environment, they do offer a real mealtime solution for those who want food that also keeps their health intact.H/T ShapeAlso on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Blue Whale Interrupts TV Presenter At Exactly The Right Moment", "text": "This whale might want to consider a job as a stand-up comedian.

According to Weather.com, the typhoon may pose a threat to mainland Japan early next week.Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, who is aboard the International Space Station, shared a photograph of Atsani from his sky-high vantage point this week, and expressed his concern for the “people on the Earth.”The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration shared video of Typhoon Goni on Facebook Tuesday:Japan’s Himawari-8 satellite has also captured images of the twin typhoons.The National Weather Service has been issuing updates on the two storms.For more on Goni and Atsani, visit the website of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the gender of Kimiya Yui.Related on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "World's Chillest Bear Hops From Pool Into Hot Tub", "text": "A Canadian couple had a bear of a scare on Monday when a furry invader busted down their fence and decided to go for a dip in the pool.After floating in the pool for a bit, the black bear then hopped into the adjacent hot tub for some more relaxation.“It’s just amazing,” North Vancouver homeowner Tony Diering told CTV. “You see funny things on YouTube, but to have it happening in your own backyard...”Diering told the network a bear, possibly the same one, was spotted in the yard eating birdseed about a month ago.He told CBC News he doesn't want any return visits from the bear.\"In the neighborhood there are a lot of small kids and obviously it's a safety concern for our neighbors,\" he said. \"I just hope the bear can get the message and basically go somewhere else.\"Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Photos Show Little Kids, Ages 7 And 9, Killing Their 'First Lion'", "text": "An American hunter is being criticized on social media for posting images of his two children, who were ages 7 and 9 at the time, posing with dead lions that they had apparently shot and killed.One of the images posted by Allen Tarpley shows his 7-year-old son, rifle in hand, posing with a dead lion.\"My 7-year-old with his first lion,\" said the caption of the now-deleted image, according to the New York Daily News.Another image shows his 9-year-old with a dead lion.The images were posted in July of last year, well before the outrage over the killing of the famed lion Cecil by American dentist Walter Palmer. They were found recently by the anti-hunting organization We Will Not Be Silenced About Hunters, which shared them on social media.The group also shared an image of a child playing with a tablet computer as he leans against a dead lion:\"Please don't hate on the child, pity him,\" the group said. \"He is being raised this way.\"It's not clear of the tablet image shows one of Tarpley's children, or is a photo of another child involved in an unrelated hunt -- and part of a trend of kids participating in trophy hunting.\"The fact a child can casually lean against the corpse of this animal and play with technology is chilling,\" a spokeswoman for the group told the Daily News.However, the pro-hunting group Game Animals of the Past and Present also shared the image of the child leaning against the lion and wrote: \"Like a boss after having tracked and shot this lioness at close range this 9 year old boy takes a break from it all and plays games on his Pad. Father can be very proud.\"Tarpley deleted the images and deleted his Twitter account, but defended the hunt to the Daily Mail, saying critics \"don't understand it.\"\"They don't care about human beings and babies being slaughtered and body parts being sold for Planned Parenthood but they care about one animal,\" he told the website. \"There was no media hype about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts but one lion gets killed and everyone goes crazy.\"He also said that his family has given up hunting as they can no longer afford it.The group Animal Shame said the fact that two young children can kill lions shows how easy \"canned\" trophy hunts are.The organization wrote on Facebook:\"Most of the lions killed by trophy hunters are captive raised and no fear of humans. Many are still dazed and confused from the tranquilizer they were given earlier in the day, when they were moved from the tiny enclosure they have spent their whole lives in, to the open large area they will be killed in. When these lions would have been shot there would have been many guns pointing at them so if the lion looks like it is going anywhere near them they open fire and is hit with a wall of bullets, so very little danger of harm.\"Those wishing to help protect lions, tigers, jaguars, cheetahs, leopards and other big cats in the wild can support National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative.Learn more here.Also on HuffPost:"}, {"title": "Lucky Seal Narrowly Escapes Jaws Of A Shark With Incredible Leap", "text": "A seal came inches away from becoming shark food as it leapt from the water with a great white shark hot on its fins off Monomoy, Cape Cod on Monday.The shark jumped out of the water after the seal, but somehow the little creature managed to leap just outside the range of the predator's massive jaws.Or as the title of the video from the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy puts it -- White Shark 0: Seal 1.And for anyone already a little leery of swimming in the ocean, consider this: The entire incident took place just 30 feet from shore in less than 10 feet of water, the organization wrote on Facebook.The conservancy said that this is the first time they've seen a great white leap from the waters near Cape Cod during a hunt.The footage was filmed by Greg Skomal of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.“It’s really a testament to the speed and power that these animals can generate in such a short amount of space and time,” he told the Boston Globe of the super seal. “It was able to literally come out of the water. It’s really amazing.”The organization also posted a still photo showing the view from above:The conservancy told the Globe that sharks are often seen breaching off South Africa and other places, but they've never seen it happen like this off Cape Cod.“(The shark) just launched himself up without taking a running start. I’ve never seen it before,” Cynthia Wigren, president of the conservancy, told the paper. “We knew it was possible, but to watch it naturally occur in front of us and get it on video -- it all ended up really well.”The shark didn't go hungry for long.

And now, the company wants to teach you about solar energy.Google on Monday launched Project Sunroof, an online tool that helps people determine whether they should get solar panels for their home. The experiment, part of Google's push to increase awareness of solar energy, analyzes your house's location, roof space and energy bill, and tells you how much solar panels will cost you -- and how much money you could save on electricity.For now, the tool is limited in scope, showing data for homes in only three general locations: the greater Boston area, the San Francisco Bay Area and Fresno, California.If you own a home in one of those places, you can input your address, and the tool will draw from aerial mapping technology to check out whether you have room on top of your house for solar panels. It will also calculate the number of hours of usable sunlight your property receives per year, taking into account \"factors like roof orientation, shade from trees and nearby buildings, and local weather patterns,\" according to Google's blog post introducing the tool.Project Sunroof weighs all this data against your current energy consumption, compares it to solar options, then shows you a guide to leasing, loaning or buying solar panels for your specific needs. It even includes links to your nearest solar panel providers. Google notes, however, that it \"may\" have been compensated by some of the solar companies it recommends.To demonstrate Project Sunroof, Google featured a San Jose, California, residence that spends $125 on monthly electric bills. The analysis found that the property could save approximately $14,000 in bills over 20 years if the homeowner were to lease solar panels.The tool also recommended that this property install a 4.25 kilowatt-strong, 255 square-foot solar panel, based on the home's average energy consumption. This would cost almost $24,000 to lease, over $25,000 to loan and $12,000 to buy over the course of 20 years (after state and tax federal incentives).Google -- which has been carbon neutral since 2007 and was the largest corporate purchaser of renewable power in the world in 2014 -- wants Americans to move away from using non-renewable and non-sustainable energy sources like coal and natural gas. But the country has a long way to go. In 2014, coal accounted for 39 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S., while natural gas accounted for 27 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. Solar power, on the other hand, generated only 0.4 percent of the country's electricity.That said, more and more Americans are beginning to use solar panels to power their homes. In 2006, about 30,000 U.S. households had solar panels. This number jumped to 400,000 in 2013, per a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group. The researchers projected, furthermore, that between 900,000 and 3.8 million households would be solar-powered by 2020.Project Sunroof is not the first online tool that offers people advice about solar power, however. Sungevity and EnergySage, for example, perform the same services as Project Sunroof, offering data for business owners too. Additionally, Sungevity works in 14 states and EnergySage works in over 30, EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal told HuffPost in an email.This post has been updated.____Alexandra Ma covers technology and world news, and is based in New York.

Consequently, the City of Miami Beach has developed adaptation strategies seeking to respond to this prediction. The city's Stormwater Management Master Plan is the first of its kind in the region.The people of Miami Beach are trying hard to protect their city. Think of Miami Beach under water. It is a scary thought.Fortunately for Miami Beach, however, the city has access to financial and personnel resources to respond to catastrophes. Yet, consider the globe's poorest nations. Bangladesh, for instance, a coastal nation in Asia, may experience a three-foot rise in sea level according to the Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers, prepared by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of climate scientists. If that happens, one-seventh of its territory would flood.The tiny Pacific island nation of Kiribati became the first country to declare that global warming is rendering its lands uninhabitable, asking for help in evacuating its population. Such a rise would be enough to put large portions of the country literally underwater. Saltwater intrusion into the water table threatens to leave a significant number of Kiribati's 100,000 residents with nothing to drink, according to a recent report published by Scientific American.These countries are also facing the same fate as Miami Beach, but they don't have the money or the human resources they need to respond effectively. Climate change affects all, but it does not affect us equally: the poor, both here in the U.S. and abroad, are often the hardest hit by its dangers and often least able to deal with it. In poor countries, climate change is already impacting economic growth, health, water availability, food production, and ecosystems.A core aspect of addressing global climate change is mitigating it - reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted by the wealthy countries. We also need to engage in adaptation techniques - responding to the realities that climate change has already caused.Among the similarities of the three Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam, two are particularly significant in developing a faithful response to the danger of climate change. Each of these religions cares deeply about poor people and requires adherents to meet their needs. Abrahamic faiths also urge believers to take good care of and protect God's creation. Genesis 2:15 says, \"The Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to till it and keep it.\" As Pope Francis stated in his recent encyclical on the environment, this Genesis passage requires human beings to take responsibility for creation and not to misuse it.The impacts of climate change must be addressed to avoid undermining or reversing the hard-won gains in building economies, wealth and opportunity in poor countries, especially those in vulnerable regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh and islands like Kiribati.The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a new multilateral fund designed to address the critical mitigation and adaptation needs of developing nations with the aim to foster resilience and low-emission development.Initially conceived during the Copenhagen climate change negotiations in 2009, the GCF is intended to be the leading international climate fund to maximize funding for these purposes. To date, a total of $10.2 billion has been pledged toward the Fund's initial capitalization from more than 30 countries. The United States has committed $3 billion, and Canada has committed $300 million. Other countries have joined as well.Providing funding to the Green Climate Fund is an essential step to support a climate change agreement by all of the nations of the world at the UN climate negotiations in Paris in December. The GCF is needed to fulfill a promise made by developed countries in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion annually for climate solutions by 2020.Here is the challenge: President Obama pledged $3 billion and asked Congress for the first $500 million for 2016, promising to urge Congress to appropriate the rest over the next five years.Though the Senate indicated initial support for the Green Climate Fund, Congress is bogged down in the appropriations process. Now is the time for Congressional leaders to clear the path for the President to ensure that the $500 million is given to the GCF.It is urgent that people of all faiths contact their members of Congress to urge them to do the right thing and provide this money to poor nations. Taking care of creation and meeting the needs of the poor are too important to our religious beliefs to ignore these urgent tasks."}, {"title": "Here's How Rats End Up In Toilet Bowls", "text": "If you don't like rats, you might want to sit down for this -- but maybe don't sit on the toilet.Intrigued by the question of how rats make it into toilet bowls (and yes, it does happen), National Geographic put together this brief video tracing the rodents' paths from street to sewer, sewer to indoor plumbing and, ultimately, into the toilet. Perhaps the most incredible part is how easily a rat can navigate the sharp 180-degree U-turn within the actual toilet pipes, all while underwater.Watch the video below:Per National Geographic, rats are naturally strong swimmers and can tread water for three straight days, paddling underwater with their back legs while the front paws steer. They can also hold their breath for up to three minutes.Rats also have unique ribs that flex around joints along their spines, the video notes. This allows the creatures to compress their ribcages to fit through small openings, thereby navigating pipes with ease.Of course, rats take advantage of far easier routes into houses as well.

With that being said, I introduce you to Chef Gavin Stephenson.Thanks Chef for the opportunity and let's get to know you!Chef Gavin Stephenson, Photo Credit: Brad PuetCan you tell us about your early beginnings with food and your passion for food?You know I always wanted to be my dad. My dad worked a lot and is well respected in his industry. I just admired him so much that I wanted to be just like him but he was gone a lot. So I ended up being in the kitchen with my mom at a young age and that's when my addiction with food began.I grew up in a family that was very classic European. My mom didn't buy anything, we made it. She made bread, she made jam. For instance we never bought spaghetti sauce. We always made it. We always made a ton of it and would always store what we made.That is how my family did things. We weren't allowed to miss any meals unless it was sports related. We had to be at the table and that's what my mom instilled in me. This may have made us a bit different because not only did we always eat together we also ate some things that some people may look at as pretty weird.I remember bringing home a couple dates to meet my parents and I would have to say to my mom, \"Mom, don't make the beef tongue tonight\" or \"Ok the tripe soup, not this Friday, mom, I really like this girl.\" She would say, \"but why\" and I would respond, \"well she probably eats normal food like steak or meat loaf.\" My mom would then respond, \"Well this is normal food. It's real food.\"  It was that type of environment that I grew up on that shaped me as a person.I was that goofy kid that would go to school with a lunch bag that had jars full of food in it. We didn't use baggies because my family looked at it as wasting food. That was the mindset we had growing up. We brought containers in and when we came home we washed those containers. At that time, other kids would bring those baggies and throw it away. Now it's the cool thing to do but back then our society didn't look at it that way. It was this type of discipline and patience that I've carried throughout my career to become a good chef.I remember picking blackberries with my mom and dad. My mom would say, \"Only pick the ripe ones. Don't pick the ones with any red on them. We want them to be ripe. The softer, the better. That way there will be less sugar in the jam and it will be really good.\" I learned to make jam when I was seven.  You know our cupboards were full of things that we made. We didn't buy spaghetti sauce. We made tomato sauce and we made a ton of it. We didn't buy mayonnaise. We would make mayonnaise. What comes so natural as going to the grocery store and buying things of the shelf and in the aisles, is different than my normal. My dad had a garden so he grew everything.When I was a really young kid, we would go over to my grandparents house and they would have a pig as a pet. Well when I was like four, I would ask where did so and so go, and my grandmother would respond, \"Oh you know they had to see such and such.\" Meanwhile we're having pork sandwiches.  As I got older, I learned to use everything. Nothing went to waste. Now I look at it through the eyes of my kids.How did your career start to shape up as you left Northern England?We moved to Chicago when I was just a kid. My dad worked for companies that would have him here in the states and so we bounced back and forth. We moved from England to Chicago, back to England, then to Oregon, then Oregon to England and so on. My family was all over the place.When I decided to get into the culinary field, my dad knew a lot of people in the industry. One of the gentlemen he knew set me up with an apprenticeship and I ended back in England. I was seventeen or eighteen at the time and that was the age when I started my culinary career in the kitchens of the Savoy company which was really cool for me.Photo Credit: Brad PuetCan you tell us about your happiness with food and your life as a chef?I was just talking to our food director today and I consider myself as an addict. I just love to eat. I love flavors. I love watching how things are grown and made. I love the intricacies of how complex things can be even when they're so simple.For me I have a lot of hobbies, but I really have just one passion which is food. That's a pretty large canvas. That could be a farmer, a beekeeper, a hunter, a forager, a fisherman - which I happen to be all those things. I like trying to understand the natural way of things and really respecting the natural way of things which plays out in my work.I like to have the natural flavor come out and it doesn't have to be complex. For example, I have quite a few ladies and gentlemen that have come from Ethiopia. One of which roasted using a butane burner and it was one of the most amazing cups of coffee I've ever had. It wasn't so scientific as you say a roast from Italy. His coffee didn't come from a ten million dollar roaster. His coffee came out of literally a can with a handle on it.Again I really believe in flavor and respect of the food first. The presentation is all about the artistic ability. Some people have the artistic ability but they might not have the passion for food, the taste. It may look amazing but it may not be full in taste.So my cooking and philosophy on food is very much that way. It's not so much about how much you pay for it, but how much you respect it.   Has moving or living in the PNW for a while now influenced your style? And how so?  Seattle is kind of like a mecca for culinaries. What we have to work with is just amazing. The Market (Pike Place Market) is just a walk away. You know when I'm trying to write a menu or if I'm searching for that perfect little ingredient for that dish, I just leave my apron on my desk and I run down there and get my inspiration. I've made a lot of friends and built a lot of relationships with vendors down there so I can just get recommendations from them any time. And I trust them.I've worked in a lot of different cities and countries, Seattle just suits my style of cooking. It's not fussy. It's casual. We're really focused on what's really good. Other cities can be really fussy. They already have a preconceived notion of what is good before you get there. In Seattle, it's about where to go and why to go. You really want to go where the chef has a respect for product and if they are doing the right thing. I try to do the right thing by putting sustainable products in my operation. I spend a lot of time trying to do the right thing and I'm not perfect by any means but I strive to be. This is how the pollination program came in. There were some folks who said that we're not going to be able to do that and they may have been right at the time but I'm going to try and kill myself trying. It's just what I'm trying to do. It's about respecting the product and finding the synergy with my work.Photo Credit: Brad PuetCan you tell us a bit about the idea of having a bee apiary on top of one of the historical hotels and high rises in the middle of downtown Seattle?It started with one of the companies I used to buy cheese from called the Cheese Cellar. Dennis and Theresa, who owned the company at the time, said to me, \"You know you should keep bees!\" I said, \"Where?\" She said, \"I know a guy named Corky in Ballard. I'll introduce you to him.\"  They introduced me to him and the next you thing you know we were at an event together and Corky tells me I should put the bees on the roof of the hotel. I thought it sounded great. I agreed to it, the GM was on board with it, and one thing led to another and started the process.We looked at the possibility of honey production but that wasn't our initial reason for doing it. We wanted to save bees. For us it was about doing the right thing. The honey was a bit of a bonus.You never know what you can get. One year you can get a tremendous amount or it could be a year where the bees don't do that well.Beekeeping in the Pacific Northwest is easy. It's difficult. It's a colder, wet climate. It's the wet part that you really need to learn about. So our first year we started with about five hives and I think they all died that year. I may have survived one but I don't remember. This was all when I was still apprenticing. We hired Corky on to help get us started and show me the ropes. He's a wonderful man and I learned a tremendous amount from him.You know, bee keeping really is a school of hard knocks. Since then a lot of water has passed under the bridge, I took the apprentice bee keepers course for Washington State and learned some more from that. I read a lot of things on the internet. I really committed and dove into it. Even with all that, I continue to kill colonies. Not on purpose obviously. (laughter) For me I'm a hands on learner and I keep learning more and more.Last year was the first year that all of our colonies survived the winter.Honey production has been great on some years and other years not so much. Once again that is also Mother Nature. We can't control the weather. It's not like we can move our bees to different farm fields or what not. We are stuck with what's around us.There's been a lot of people who have worked with me on the project. Jake and Chloe are the 2 newest members to work on the team. My goal now is to try to get as many people involved as possible. I want people to learn and be motivated. I want them to take classes and courses and become future beekeepers.So now the hotel has an awesome urban apiary in the middle of downtown Seattle!Every third bite of food you put in your mouth, a bee has something to do with it. When I first heard that I was like, \"No way! Really!?! It can't be.\" So I started to do some research. I definitely found the pros and cons and myths and truths. So if you could see from the larger scope of what we have been able to do as mankind: we've been able to land on the moon, we've been able to split an atom, I mean, think about all the things we have been able to do. To this day, we still have not been able to figure out how to pollinate without insects. I kept researching it and then Colony Collapse happened. No one knew what that was or the extent of how that affects us and I knew I had to do something about it because that's just the type of guy I am.So I told myself, \"Self, what can you do about it?\" Sure I can start a hive in my backyard - which I do have - but that would only affect me and my family. So I thought how good would it be if the hotel got involved. The impact would be greater. When I brought it up, I was happy at the response it got. The amount of support was crazy. We had all the different departments paint their own hives. Everyone wanted and got involved. I have a great sense of pride in the hotel because of it.Photo Credit: Brad PuetIn my limited time watching you, I found beekeeping to be extremely fascinating. I can see how someone can become passionate about it as it is a natural way of keeping the order of things as well as it helps out the world in so many ways. Can you tell us about your personal passion for bee keeping and infusing that into your work at the Fairmont?My first year, I was also very fascinated by it all. It's amazing to watch how the bees work and how fast they do their work. It's great to see how fast the hive grows, how they build, how they respect the queen, and how everything is just driven. It went from doing the right thing to learning about honey and tasting raw, unfiltered honey and how that can be used in the grander scheme of things. I learned the effects of pesticides and also as farmers, as beekeepers, learned what we can do to manage a hive.I didn't know any of those things.Now I know what I can do to help the hives succeed. From learning about mites and managing the damage that they do to learning how to conserve and leave enough honey stores in the winter to live on, I learn all of these things and more. We also know now what we are able to use as far as the hotel and able to use that for us without affecting them. It's really nice because people who learn more about what we do, want to learn more and be a part of it.It's a great thing for urban beekeeping.You know as a consumer, I never really had the respect for honey as I do now. I see how hard it takes to have a successful honey crop.From a culinary standpoint, can you tell us what the difference is between urban and non-urban honey? You know I thought there would be a huge difference. You know every hive's honey tastes a bit different. You know it could be my imagination, but I'm finding that during different times of the year, there is a different flow to the honey. So like right now we are coming off of the big leaf maple flow. There are other sources of pollen but mainly the major flow comes from the maple. Maple has a very different taste than, let's say blackberry honey, which is our next flow.You start noticing things when you become a beekeeper. I notice when the leaves change when the flowers come in and the next flow is going to come in. I can also see this based on the bees. They have a purpose and it's like bullets in and bullets out when they happen on a good flow. So for instance today, there were a lot of bees coming in and out but not necessarily bulleting in and out and so that tells me that the next flow isn't quite on yet. When they happen on a good flow they can fill a box really fast.Photo Credit: Brad PuetCan you explain to us this love you have for beekeeping and the mission you have now for it?I'm a pretty responsible person, you know, I like to do thing the right way. So I really wanted to try and figure out how to have an urban apiary, and a sustainable one at that. One that I don't really have to rely on things outside of my apiary and I'm not there yet but I feel that I have enough diversity invested in it that I'm getting there.Honestly, I just like watching the bees work. It's really cool. Like if I had a rough week, I'll go up there at two o'clock in the afternoon, on a really hot sunny day, and watch them work. I sit back and I feel better. I look at it and think to myself, \"Wow, I designed that, I built that. It was my hard work. I taught people how to do that.\" So I get that sense of satisfaction, you know.And the best is when I have a new beekeepers like Jake and Chloe. Watching them learn and grow as a beekeeper is truly amazing. I love it when they pull out a frame and they see the queen and I get to share in their excitement. Or when they dip into the honey and they taste it. Watching them enjoy eating warm honey out of the hive. It's those little things and those big things that give me satisfaction.You know it's just watching them learn.Also I get to see how these hives change my personal life. I have the hives in my backyard and its as simple as my neighbors asking me, \"How are your bees doing?\" and me saying, \"Here's your jar of honey.\" I think it's the coolest thing ever to give the honey to them. You know since I've been keeping bees, my family doesn't really use processed sugar any more. We use honey. It's the honey that my bees make.I do have a bit of a sweet tooth sometimes, well all the time. So the honey that I have is all made in my backyard. My kids are all about it. They absolutely love it. My family eats quite a bit of honey. We went from a little squeezy bear once every two years to a little more than a half a gallon a year.We definitely love our honey.Follow the Fairmont Hotel Olympic: Website / Facebook / Twitter / Instagram"}, {"title": "Healthy, Buggy Harvest: The Joys and Jolts of Chemical-Free Orcharding", "text": "The ripening Winesap had a beautiful pinkish cast to its skin, a shine that promised good eating--and a long-legged, fierce-looking insect clinging to it. An assassin bug that could inflict a nasty, painful bite.We were absolutely thrilled.This year Jeff and I have sworn off using chemical sprays at our five-acre orchard in the Virginia mountains. We've been moving in this direction for several years but until now hadn't gotten up the nerve to go completely chemical-free.Finding assassin bugs all over our apples made us whoop with joy--literally. These lanky, scary-looking creatures eat Japanese beetles, which last year caused serious damage to our trees.In summers past we found it just too painful to watch hundreds of brightly colored beetles turn the leaves of our beloved heritage apple trees into skeletons. Last year we caved in and applied a pesticide that we knew would probably kill beneficial insects too. But this year we're applying neem oil, a natural substance that supposedly makes Japanese beetles throw up, along with a solution of tea made from stinging nettles to boost the trees' immune system.Are our trees better off? The jury is still out, and will be for quite some time.I should stress here that Jeff and I are hobby orchardists. We don't depend on income from our apples. In fact, the property is something of a money pit.We've had our little part of the family orchard since 1997, and for most of that time it's been under the care of a skilled professional orchardist who applies as light a chemical spray as possible. Jeff and I love the idea of growing some of the heritage apples that have become increasingly rare. We've filled most of our land with varieties no one has ever heard of, like Magnum Bonum and Razor Russett. As our crop ripens in the fall, we host apple tastings for friends that, in our minds, rival anything offered by the wineries of California.When we began grafting these vanishing varieties, though, it didn't occur to us that they might be rare for a reason: weak resistance to Southern pests and diseases.Through the years, we've become increasingly uncomfortable as we've learned about the damage being done to honey bees and native insects by common orchard chemicals like fungicides. In 2014, the professional orchardist told us he could no longer tend the land for us. A nearby neighbor had raised concerns about the effects of the chemical sprays. We told him we understood and wished him well. And Jeff began reading everything he could find on non-chemical sprays.This approach is incredibly labor intensive, which is especially difficult for us, since we live more than 300 miles away. Fallen apples must be picked up to cut down on apple coddling moths. Branches infected with fire blight must be carefully trimmed and taken out of the orchard--but only when the trees are absolutely dry. Moisture spreads the spores. Tree trunks and branches must be inspected for round-headed apple borers, which infested our Magnum Bonums this year. Jeff cut as many of the larvae out of the trunks as he could find, then packed the wounds with beneficial nematodes.Time to thin the crop--by handThe hardest part always comes in the heat of summer, as the pests multiply and fungi spread and the smorgasbord begins in earnest. It's wrenching to watch the bugs feed and the leaves develop the yellow and reddish circles known as frogeye, a symptom of black rot. It's painful to simply walk away and hope we've helped our trees build up the inner strength to survive.We know many of the trees we've so lovingly grafted and tended for eight years may not make it. But that, as they say, is farming. Three years ago an entire row of baby Razor Russet trees was nearly decimated by an outbreak of 17-year locusts, which no chemical spray could have put down. When I first saw the tiny, scarred trunks, I broke into tears. My personal challenge, it seems, is to not fall too deeply in love with a bunch of trees, no matter how tasty their fruit.And honestly, as conservationists we have to ask: Is it worth applying products like Sevin to sustain rare, fragile varieties of fruit? Or should we concentrate on the heartier varieties like Old Fashioned Winesap that seem more capable of warding off Southern pests and diseases on their own? If we're to do right by the natural system, the answer is obvious.So we'll celebrate our small victories, like the presence of assassin bugs and other predatory insects like the wheel bug. We'll pick up fallen apples and spread wood chips beneath trees to encourage a healthy ecosystem.If we find that our beloved heritage trees can't make it without chemicals, we'll shed our tears but keep the lid firmly on the bottle of Sevin. At least, I hope we will. Time will tell. And we'll enjoy what remains of our chemical-free harvest, be it small or large.Wheelbug (a type of assassin bug) eating a Japanese beetle."}, {"title": "Oklahoma Residents Leave Water Out For Mail Carriers During Heatwave, Get Stamp Of Approval", "text": "Signed, sealed, delivered -- it’s hot out!Residents in The Village, Oklahoma, are helping to keep mail carriers cool amid this summer’s heat wave by putting out coolers of icy cold drinks, KOCO reported.

The two pals snuggle together, play together and follow each other around, she added. Shelter staff who posted a video of the feline friends on YouTube call Hefty a \"guide cat\":Neikam said Hefty seems to have a “sense of awareness” that Blinkin’ can’t see and may need extra help, and will seek him out when the two are apart.She added that the cats have been getting a lot of media attention and that the shelter has received a lot of informal requests, but so far no one has actually filled out an adoption application. The two kittens, she said, are “very, very playful,” affectionate with humans and must be adopted together.

The methane proposal would cut releases from drill sites and infrastructure 20 to 30 percent nationally in the next 10 years, the agency said.The agency described the standards as a \"flexible approach\" to reducing a major contributor to climate change.The proposals, said Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, \"clearly recognize that domestic natural gas production provides abundant clean energy,\" but also that \"this valuable resource must be developed responsibly and safely.\"The proposed rules build on standards the EPA released in 2012 that required natural gas drilling sites to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. They expand the rules to include methane emissions from new sites, and also require new hydraulically fracked oil-drilling wells -- which often also contain natural gas reserves -- to reduce emissions. And they expand the types of facilities covered by the rules to include new and modified infrastructure such as compressors and pumping stations.In January, the Obama administration first announced an overall target for cutting methane emissions up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, as part of its larger plan to address the heat-trapping emissions that cause climate change. Methane accounts for about 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates that its proposed methane cuts would equate to up to 9 million metric tons of carbon.The EPA said it, along with other agencies, is looking at a variety of options for meeting the additional methane reductions outlined in the Obama plan.Environmental groups said rules for new oil and gas operations are a good start, but want the administration to start setting requirements for existing drilling operations, which would help get the country closer to the 45 percent goal. \"Curbing the oil and gas industry’s rampant methane pollution problem is the next biggest thing the White House can do to fight climate change after addressing carbon pollution from power plants,\" said Meleah Geertsma, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Meaningful progress in combating this potent climate pollutant will require an industry-wide cleanup -- from infrastructure new and old, nationwide. We are hopeful today's announcement is just the beginning.\"But the oil and gas industry argued that the proposal is \"redundant\" because the 2012 rules on VOCs are already reducing methane emissions at natural gas drilling sites and the industry has taken a number of voluntary actions that have reduced methane emissions. Howard Feldman, the senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, called the proposal \"an additional burden on the industry\" in a call with reporters Tuesday.\"This is not the time to jeopardize the shale revolution in America,\" said Feldman.There will be a 60-day public comment period on the new proposals."}, {"title": "Abused Donkey Is Rescued In An Unlikely Place", "text": "Fernando, a Spanish donkey, knew nothing but work for his first 20 years on Earth.

Around 1,000 of the group managed to enter the vast open-pit lignite mine of Garzweiler in Germany's Rhineland, bringing the giant excavators to a standstill.Lignite or brown coal is the most carbon-polluting fossil fuel. Utility company RWE that operates the vast lignite mines and power plants in the Rhineland is the single biggest emitter of CO2 in Europe.The activists openly announced well in advance of the action that they are no longer prepared to watch politicians' failure to act on climate change and are prepared to peacefully enter the mine to stop the world's largest diggers and demand an end of coal. As a result, 1,000 police in addition to RWE's private security service were on site to prevent the activists from entering the mine. In places, the police reacted with extensive use of pepper spray and batons but the activists remained calm and committed to non-violence.Around 1,000 activists managed to enter the mine and shut it down for hours. The true impact of the action however is the message it sends to governments and the fossil fuel industry and the power ordinary people are building. Many of those that joined have never taken direct action before and said the action left them feeling empowered to bring about change.One of the participants from the UK writes that he hopes \"we are entering a period which will be remembered as a time when normal people got together and did extraordinary things.

If we fail in California, how can we succeed anywhere else?At the most reductive level, the traditional water supply system in California has been overwhelmed by climate, industrial agriculture, and water-rich consumption that has been the envy of the world but can survive no longer without revolutionary change. If there is not enough water on the mountaintops to feed the watersheds, rivers, and reservoirs, then where will the requisite water come from?In 2012, the San Diego County Water Authority signed an agreement to build the largest desalination plant in the United States. The process is not new; it is applied today in some 21,000 desalination plants in over 120 countries, including Italy, Australia, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Japan, China, India, United Arab Emirates, Malta, Cape Verde, and Cyprus, producing more than 3.5 billion gallons of potable water per day. Saudi Arabia leads the world, meeting 70% of the daily needs of its population.The San Diego project is proposed to come on line in 2015 and to provide 7% of the Authority's demand by 2020. The plant is to be built and operated by Poseidon Water, a private investor-owned company that develops water and wastewater infrastructure. The contract is for 30 years, after which the Authority can purchase the plant for $1. The company is also building a 10-mile pipeline to deliver treated water inland to the Authority's aqueduct system where it can augment existing collected or natural supply to serve the needs of the 24 regional member water agencies serving 3.1 million people.The Carlsbad Desalination Plant occupies 6 acres of the 388 acre ocean-front site of the Encina Power Station that for 50 years has run on oil and natural gas, releasing emissions, and requiring a large dredged lagoon to hold sea water for cooling and to receive plant effluent - a stagnant, stinking reminder of an old technology. The adjacent desalination plant will use a reverse osmosis process with its source water coming from the generating plant cooling supply, treated and pumped under pressure through membranes to remove salt and other microscopic impurities.In the past, the primary objections to desalination have been salt residue, corrosion, habitat destruction, and cost. The Poseidon plant has undergone comprehensive review by the local, state, and federal agencies, each determined to protect its constituents and the environment. For every two gallons treated, one will be quality drinking water and the other diluted salt content for return to the ocean. The plant will run on Encina electricity to power high-speed pumps at market rates built into the contract. The approvals indicate that there will be no noise, no odor, and no environmental impact. Remarkably, the surrounding land has already been renewed by the prospect of the new plant and has been re-developed by the Authority to transform the embayment into a viable environment for marine life and community activities.The San Diego region has been a center for the development of international desalination technology. The reverse osmosis process was born from a local company in the 1960s. There are some 35 related companies in the area employing 2,200 people and generating over $200 million in annual revenue. According to the Authority, the Poseidon Project \"will have significant economic benefit for the region, including $350 million in spending during construction, 2,400 construction-related jobs, and $50 million in annual spending throughout the region once the desalination plant is operational. For the region, the facility will create jobs, generate tax revenue, improve water quality and enhance water reliability with a new drought-proof supply.\"Drought-proof?These hopeful numbers and language are the typical political arguments that have been used to justify new technology for a long time. The financial estimates may or may not be predicable or accurate, but the ultimate return is inevitable when there is suddenly no more water available, we need the salt water turned fresh, and the cost is priceless."}, {"title": "Bunny Wheelchair Is Huge Help For Giant Rabbit Who Couldn't Walk", "text": "Bertha is one giant fluffy ball of cuteness.

She is starved, beaten, stuck with nails, stabbed in the ears, sleep-deprived and beaten with bull hooks.After her training she was hired out to a tourist camp to go to work giving rides all day and not allowed to do what elephants need to do to survive, which is to eat 12-18 hours a day, consuming 200-600 pound of leaves and grass and drink 50 gallons of water a day. Instead they are forced to trek back and forth on the same path all day long, becoming dehydrated and hungry.MeBai stopped eating and soon was no longer any use to her owners. Thankfully for her because of the Pamper a Pachyderm program, they knew her mother and were able to reunite them.Fortunately for MeBai, her story has a happy ending as she was eventually saved from a life of drudgery by the Elephant Nature Park. (ENP). This is highly the exception.A tourist bucket listOften people think of riding elephants when they visit Southeast Asia as part of the tourist agenda. Most people don't realize what the elephant goes through to allow them to enjoy a ride on their backs.This practice of crush is used in every country in Asia, according Richard Lair, an American expatriate and international relations officer for Thailand's Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang. Lair has studied domesticated elephants for more than 20 years and is author of the UN report Gone Astray: The Care and Management of the Asian Elephant in Domesticity.CaptivityThe Asian elephant was historically highly revered and domesticated to be trained for working in the country. Unfortunately the population of hundreds of thousands of elephants which existed centuries ago, according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, estimated that between only 25,000 and 32,000 Asian elephants are left in the wild. The Asian elephant has been listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Thailand has the largest number of elephants for tourism as it has a larger population in general than its neighboring countries. Elephant extinction, unfortunately is very real everywhere. Only 3,500 to 5,000 exist today.Because of the reduction of logging, mahouts, those who tend elephants, have had to find other ways to support their elephants. In order to do this, many go begging in the streets and turned to illegal logging and to tourism via trekking, rides or entertainment.Many mahouts resort to abusing their charges in order to get them to work harder and longer in either giving rides to tourists or illegal and dangerous logging environments. Some will even feed their amphetamines to reduce their appetite and increase their work output. The elephants won't last for long under this treatment simply die of overwork and starvation.TourismUnfortunately the laws in Thailand and Cambodia are not strong enough to protect elephants from abuse. Today they are considered nothing but livestock, no different than buffalo or cattle, which are not protected against abuse. The law is rarely enforced and fines are small.Tourists can show their support and concern to counter elephant abuse by not supporting organizations that sell rides as entertainment and instead visit legitimate elephant sanctuaries and use their tourist dollars as a donation and sign petitions to stop the abusive treatment:"}, {"title": "China's Miracle Economy Goes from Illusion to Nightmare?", "text": "If there was one virtue that China projected, it was an economy that could handle like a BMW, and go from 0 to 7.5% growth in 3 months. The 2008 global \"great recession\" appeared like a test drive. The globe appeared prepared to tolerate human rights abuse of minorities, suffocation of dissent, gross pollution and even overt territorial threats to neighbors if that meant having China as the engine for global growth.China Enters Currency Wars?However, the illusion of a centrally controlled economy acting out its role on a capitalist global stage has taken perhaps an unexpected and potentially dangerous turn. China's economy has slowed down markedly, and this has left much of the globe's policy makers without the safety net most assumed Beijing represented with its vast foreign currency reserves. Worse, with its recent devaluation, China has now joined the currency wars rather than stand above them, and there is the real risk of recession and deflation waiting as landmines for the next step of interest rate hikes, whether from the US Fed and the ECB. The IMF is aware of the risk, but will anyone listen in Beijing or Washington, or merely engage in verbal swashbuckling particularly as the US Presidential campaign takes main stage? (Read: \"IMF sees Risk for US Economy if Interest Rates Raised Prematurely\")China's Export of Labor Suppressed of Political Rights & Healthy Working Conditions?There are even greater long standing consequences of the illusory China. We have come to tolerate, and some even model their own economic plans on the basis of a miracle. Workers' rights are subdued presumably as part of labor competing on a global scale. Income inequality is given lip service while a new class of super-entitled control not only capital but the buying and selling of politics. The state is ever more embedded into everything from bedrooms to culture, and freedom on the Internet. Beijing urges and applies greater \"regulation\" as necessary to maximize the commercial utility of the Web. (See: \"Come to the Virtual Atlantis\")Suffocating in its Own Pollution  Worse is coming perhaps, as evidenced by the past several decades of suffocation of the environment, contamination of food and industrial accidents that dominate China's economic expansion. The recent explosion at China's Tianjin seaport and the still continuing poisons spewing out are only the tip of a big iceberg, and the lack of transparency only makes it less visible and more difficult to asses and address.Realignment of Global Alliances as Response to Domestic Failings?Can it get any worse? Unfortunately now being exposed, the authoritarian, quasi-Communist emperors in Beijing need an outlet for the dashed hopes and disapproval of their populations. They will not admit that their mutation of centrally controlled economy, capitalist transplants and authoritarian politics is doomed. There is no utopia. The excesses of a new elite will be symbolically punished by firing squads, somewhat more convincing than the treatment of a few oligarchs in Putin's Russia. Dissent, whether of political opponents, artists or minorities, will be mercilessly suppressed as purported dangers to the state. More troubling, nationalism will be ever more the outlet. Whether imposing its territorial claims in the East China Sea (Japan and Korea) and/or South China Sea (Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, etc.,) Beijing will rouse national honor to camouflage domestic economic and political deficiencies. The US will appear as potential opponent on one side while Putin's Moscow will be a willing ally on the other, with its own agenda of distracting Washington. (See: \"Construction According to Putin's Model...\")What Would Donald Trump Do?I don't buy Donald Trump's political grandstanding of accusing \"our leaders of being stupid\" in dealing with Beijing. Indeed, it would be both tragic and comic in Shakespearean definition, to watch an encounter between the Great Donald and Beijing leaders, beyond lost in translation. It is more accurate that the US may have to choose between bad and worse options lacking obvious tools to counter Beijing's excesses. The UN may not be as yet mature enough to address systemic abuses arising from members of the \"P-5,\" the UN's Security Council Veto powers. (See: \"UN at 70, Ready to Be Retired?\") Beijing, anyway, has already resisted any effort to resolve its territorial disputes with neighbors in a multilateral forum or via international courts as the International Court of Justice. Beijing tactically sees it more opportune to pressure, bully its smaller neighbors into concession rather than accede to a broader regional approach and compromise.Mercantilist at the CoreThe China economic miracle has from the outset lacked the transparency as well as political and societal freedom needed for sustainability. Utopia is much less and perhaps worse if imposed from the top of an authoritarian hierarchy. The new China has been grounded in mercantilist ambitions rather than such to benefit its citizens or neighbors and globe as whole, while fed by memories of when it suffered from the dominance of others. Now that it is coming undone, could we also foresee a China adopting the excesses of mercantilism exhibited by previous reiterations, from European colonial powers to more recently the Imperial Japan of a century earlier?@MuhamedSacirbeyPHOTO: upstreamonline.com"}, {"title": "Hillary Clinton Breaks With Obama Over Arctic Drilling", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has agreed with the vast majority of President Barack Obama's policies, but in a Tweet on Tuesday she expressed her disapproval with one: letting Shell drill for oil in the Arctic.Clinton had previously said she was \"skeptical\" and had \"doubts\" as to whether the Obama administration should have given Shell the go-ahead for exploratory drilling. The oil company's permit from the U.S. Department of the Interior allows it to drill in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska. Shell halted its drilling program in the region after it lost control of a massive rig in 2012.Environmental advocates say drilling in the Arctic will deepen the United States' reliance on oil, harm local wildlife and upset the region's fragile ecosystem. They have called Obama's planned visit to the region later this month -- the first to the Arctic by a sitting U.S. president -- hypocritical, given the president's focus on combatting climate change since he took office.Clinton's willingness to come out against Arctic drilling is at odds with her non-answer on whether she supports construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

And I've always wanted to stop using the bottles but I could never decide on the type of reusable bottle to get or which type of water filters; should I get Brita or the other brand that advertises cleaner water.I let years go by trying to decide. Then one day when I was out of bottled water I decided to use my filtered water from the refrigerator. I had only used it for making coffee and cooking and I don't cook much so maybe it was used for tea and soups.I put the water in a glass bottle I had left over from lemonade, put in the fridge and have been using it ever since. It's easy to manage and drink and I fill it up quite easily when needed. One thing I noticed is that I am actually tasting the water. The bottled waters seem to be so sterilized and filtered that there is no taste at all. And not that water really has a taste, but the tap water is noticeable and delicious.A few years back, we had a hurricane or a big storm come through Miami.

They also failed to ensure that workers used appropriate work methods and respirators, and to train them about the hazards of working around asbestos,\" according to an Aug. 11 news release.A number of the exposed workers \"came to the U.S. to work for Kehrer under the H-2B visa program that allows companies to hire foreign workers temporarily. The investigation also found the Kehrer management threatened some workers with termination if they spoke with OSHA inspectors,\" the agency noted in its release.Elsewhere in Illinois, Centralia's Schiller Elementary School was forced to close just days before classes were due to start after workers discovered mold growing on asbestos-containing insulation. Teachers had to pack up and move to a church across town, where the 200 students will attend classes until a cleanup is complete. The closing came just days after a Washington Post report spotlighting the continued threat that asbestos poses to students, teachers and others at many of the nation's schools.Military veterans are no strangers to the dangers of asbestos, accounting for roughly 30 percent of all victims of mesothelioma, an incurable cancer caused by exposure to the mineral. Asbestos was once widely used by all branches of the military, most notably as a component in Navy ships built over decades.So it's particularly ironic that far from the ships, tanks and other vehicles that exposed millions of military men and women to the lethal fibers, federal worker safety inspectors last month found asbestos in a stairwell and overhead spaces at the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center.In addition to these confirmed exposure threats, what could be a much more widespread case developed when a routine Environmental Protection Agency inspection of an abandoned mine near Riverton, Colo. turned into an environmental and public health disaster. The federal workers inadvertently released 3 million gallons of toxic waste into the once-pristine Animas River, which now runs mustard yellow. The river, a favorite of whitewater rafting and fly fishing enthusiasts and a source of drinking water for Durango and several other communities, now contains extremely high levels of lead, arsenic and other toxic substances. Similar accidents in the past have resulted in asbestos contamination as well, and it could very well turn up in the Animas, according to experts and media reports.These four real-life and recent examples reflect the widespread danger that asbestos poses for virtually every American community, where even the slightest exposures can result in serious, often fatal, health problems later in life. A naturally occurring mineral once heavily mined in western states, asbestos was widely used in a wide variety of products and settings, and it still turns up in many American homes, schools, public buildings and even in some children's toys. Up to 15,000 Americans die each year from asbestos-related diseases, and the toll is not likely to drop any time soon.In an effort to address the problem, a bill pending before Congress - the Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database (or READ) Act sponsored by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) in the Senate and Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) in the House - would require companies that use asbestos to regularly disclose what products it's in and where they may be located. The information would be turned over to EPA and made available online so people could find out where there may be asbestos-containing items in their local area.Tell your lawmakers to support the READ Act."}, {"title": "Study Reveals Vast Unrecorded Oil and Gas Industry Methane Emissions", "text": "A new study published today reveals that facilities that collect and gather natural gas from well sites across the United States emit about one hundred billion cubic feet of natural gas a year, roughly eight times the previous estimates by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the segment. The wasted gas identified in the study is worth about $300 million, and packs the same 20-year climate impact as 37 coal-fired power plants.Until now, emissions from thousands of gathering facilities - which consolidate gas from multiple wells in an area and feed it into processing plants or pipelines - have been largely uncounted in federal statistics, yet they may be the largest methane source in the oil and gas supply chain. Indeed, the newly identified emissions from gathering facilities would increase total emissions from the natural gas supply chain in EPA's current Greenhouse Gas Inventory by approximately 25 percent if added to the tally.The study was conducted by scientists at Colorado State University and published today in Environmental Science & Technology.EPA doesn't track emissions from gathering facilities separately from production activities, and there have been no estimates and almost no research on them until now. One reason prior emissions estimates are so uncertain is because the number of facilities was completely unknown. Without conducting a full census, the CSU researchers were able to put the figure at between 3,846 and 5,470 facilities - a wide range, but far better than the guesswork than existed previously.A different study in the Barnett Shale recently found over 250 gathering facilities, many more than anyone realized, and confirmed they were the industry's biggest methane source in the region.Compare & ContrastThe new CSU study also looked at natural gas processing facilities. Unlike gathering, the processing phase is well accounted for, in part because of stronger reporting requirements and regulatory oversight. Thanks to rigorous leak detection and repair programs, these processing emissions are much better controlled.In fact, according to the study, processing emissions are lower than the EPA inventory (although they are also three times higher than reported under the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, because of differing reporting requirements), enough to lower the inventory by about 5 percent.That's good news, but it's nowhere near enough to offset the huge emissions uncovered on the gathering side. The combined result of the study still shows a net increase of 18.1%, a huge jump if it were accurately reflected in EPA figures for all natural gas systems. What's more, the combined emissions from gathering and processing emissions are a whopping 87% higher than EPA inventory estimates for those sectors (which are currently tallied together as one).Fixing the ProblemAs EPA and the federal Bureau of Land Management prepare to introduce rules to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, these contrasting results underscore just how important effective policy can be.EPA is already beginning to take some steps to address the issues uncovered by this research -- there is currently a pending rule at the agency that would require gathering systems to report methane emissions to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (which is separate from their estimated inventories), and this new study can help inform those changes.But even more importantly, it is critical for EPA to propose methane emissions rules this summer that provide rigorous and comprehensive oversight of the oil and gas supply chain. As this new research shows, when operations go unmeasured, overlooked and poorly regulated, it can lead to massive leaks and little understanding of how to fix them.Growing Body of ResearchThe study is the last of four EDF-led studies focused on the individual segments of the natural gas supply chain (production, gathering and processing, transmission and storage, and local distribution). A forthcoming synthesis paper will put these pieces together with 11 other studies to present a more complete picture of the methane emissions across the different sectors in the natural gas supply chain.This blog post is cross-posted with EDF's blog, Energy Exchange."}, {"title": "Little Kitten Tries To Copy Mom, Fails Adorably", "text": "This isn't just any old copycat -- it's a copy-kitten.The clip, which was posted by American's Funniest Home Videos on Facebook and YouTube, shows little Neo trying to mimic mom's grooming habits with absolutely adorable results.Neo hasn't quite figured it out yet, but that may be because the kitten was just 25 days old when the video was recorded, according to the original clip posted on YouTube earlier this summer.Neo's owner, Ari K, has been documenting the kitten's daily life on YouTube.

Just a short twelve-minute drive southeast of the festival location lies a different Coachella -- one not nearly as glamorous. It's actually quite the opposite: filthy, decaying and in need of your help.Shady Lane Mobilehome Park is home to about forty migrant farmworkers and their families. At the park, electricity outages often last for weeks, leaving families without air conditioning during the Coachella Valley's exceptionally hot summers. One woman fell ill when her home temperature reached over 115 degrees. Unable to bear the heat, many families are forced to sleep outside. Running water often shuts down for entire days, leaving residents unable to wash their hands or take showers. The park's septic frequently malfunctions, causing waste to overflow during the rainy season and when residents wash clothing. Homes are falling apart, letting rain and cockroaches inside. Check out the shocking video above to learn more.\"When my children use the bathtub, waste often comes out of the drain,\" says Joel Beltran, a Shady Lane father.Carina Felix, a resident of the park, recounts the troubles she faces as a student living at the park: \"Power outages are common...I have to often decide between using the Internet to do my homework or staying cool.\"Joseph Salgado, pictured below, suffers from asthma. He uses a mechanical nebulizer to alleviate his symptoms, which are exacerbated by the heat of the Coachella Valley. His home's air conditioning system is unreliable, and during the summer, the temperature in his room often reaches over 100 degrees. During one of his asthma attacks, the electricity malfunctioned and the wiring of his nebulizer shocked him.Instead of improving these conditions, the park owner neglected the residents of the park. In 2011, the owner took steps toward closing the park, which would have left the families at Shady Lane without anywhere to live.To take control of their park, residents incorporated Shady Lane Mobilehome Park, Inc. (SLMP), a nonprofit organization that intends to purchase the park and repair its electrical, water and sewage systems. It eventually hopes to replace worn-down mobile home units and construct a community center, including a playground for the children! To finance these costs, SLMP recently launched a 60-day Indiegogo campaign titled \"The Real Coachella.\"This past summer, alongside a dedicated team of lawyers, law students and videographers, I visited the families of Shady Lane to hear their stories, collaborate with them and shoot our campaign video. It was heartbreaking to see kind, incredibly hardworking people, whose labor puts food on our tables, live in such appalling conditions. And it astounded me that, despite the unrelenting adversity they face on a daily basis, these farmworkers and their families stay optimistic; as one resident put it, \"To me, this park means home, family, hope.\"One reason I so strongly empathize with families at Shady Lane Mobilehome Park is because, as a gay person, I have a deep, internalized passion for human rights. While I have never had to deal with sewage overflows when I wash clothing, or never lived weeks without electricity, I understand, and just about all LGBTQI+ Americans understand, what it's like to be shackled to the shadows of a system that claims to promote opportunity and equality for all. We understand what it's like for injustice to be normalized, to have our dignities disgraced. And we certainly understand what it takes to produce change: mobilizing and organizing, diligent advocacy, and the support of sympathetic allies.It's important that as LGBTQI+ people gain more recognition and are granted more rights, we do not forget that our society still completely ignores - and by extension, exploits - many disadvantaged groups, including the farmworker families at Shady Lane. We cannot afford to forget. Humanity cannot afford for us to forget. And real people, with dignity, in hopeless situations, cannot afford for us to forget. We must stand in solidarity with other historically marginalized groups and utilize our empathy, passion, knowledge and resources to promote human rights for all.#TheRealCoachella charity campaign is an incredible opportunity for LGBTQI+ people, and all people, to change the lives of some of America's most disadvantaged families.

It will be the biggest gathering of its kind since 2009, and it's potentially a big deal for our global movement.In Paris our governments are supposed to agree on a shared target for climate action, based on the national plans governments have been putting together all year -- but the numbers just aren't adding up. Everything being discussed will allow too many communities that have polluted the least to be devastated by floods, rising sea levels and other disasters.This has the makings of a global failure of ambition -- and at a moment when renewable energy is becoming a revolutionary economic force that could power a just transition away from fossil fuels. Click here to join us in telling world leaders to keep fossil fuels underground and finance a just transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.Our movement has grown tremendously -- and it shows every time a new leader stands up to declare we must keep fossil fuels underground, or a university, church or pension fund divests from fossil fuels. The problem is the power of the fossil fuel industry.The Paris negotiations could potentially send a signal that world governments are serious about keeping fossil fuels in the ground. If they fail, it will embolden the fossil fuel industry and expose more communities to toxic extraction and climate disasters.The solutions are obvious: we need to stop digging up and burning fossil fuels, start building renewable energy everywhere we can, and make sure communities on the front lines of climate change have the resources they need to respond to the crisis.This could be a turning point -- if we push for it.The time for feeling powerless in the face of climate chaos is over. No matter what happens in the negotiating halls, we must build power to hold them accountable to the principles of justice and science.After many months of consultation with our global network, here is the plan for what I call \"The Road Through Paris\": the plan to grow our movement and hold world leaders accountable to the action we need.First, in September we will launch a global framework to grow the movement before and after the Paris talks. On September 10th, Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein and others will be joined by global movement leaders in New York City for an evening that will help set the stage for this dramatic season of climate action that will lead straight through the big Paris conference in December and beyond. The event is called Off and On, and it will be held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on September 10th at 7 PM.Then on September 26th communities across the globe will hold workshops to plan for the coming months of action. After that, I think we'll see several months of escalating activity as communities drive the message home that we can't wait for action.The talks in Paris start on November 30th, and run for 2 weeks. But before the talks start, the world will stand together in a weekend of global action, paired with an enormous march in the streets of Paris. During the talks, 350's team on the ground will do their best to help keep you in the loop on the most important developments. And when the talks wrap up, we're planning a big action in Paris on December 12th to make sure the people -- not the politicians -- have the last word.But most importantly, we won't stop there. I want you to mark your calendars for the month of April in 2016. That's when we will mobilize in a global wave of action unlike any we've seen before. Not one big march in one city, not a scattering of local actions -- but rather a wave of historic national and continent-wide mobilizations targeting the fossil fuel projects that must be kept in the ground, and backing the energy solutions that will take their place.In the 6 years 350.org has been around, this is the most ambitious plan we've ever proposed. But ambition is what is called for, along with courage, faith in each other and the readiness to respond when disaster strikes, plans change, or politicians fail to lead.We are nearer than ever to the changes we've been fighting to see.

Shell interrupted its drilling program in the region in 2012 after suffering a series of mishaps, including losing control of an enormous rig, from which the Coast Guard had to rescue 18 workers.Harsh conditions in the Chukchi have discouraged other oil companies from drilling there.The go-ahead for Shell comes after repairs were completed to the Fennica, an icebreaker the company leases that carries emergency well-plugging equipment. The ship had suffered a gash in its hull after hitting uncharted shoals off southern Alaska.Damage to the Fennica had stalled Shell's program, which the Interior Department had previously issued a permit for.Shell obtained the leases in the Chukchi during the administration of former President George W.

Since then it has spent about $7 billion on exploration in the Arctic, though oil production is at least a decade away.The Arctic is home to what the U.S. government estimates is 20 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas.Shell's determination to drill there has spawned waves of protests and funding drives by environmentalists who want to protect whales, walruses and polar bears in a vulnerable region that scientists say is changing rapidly due to global warming.Late last month, 13 Greenpeace activists hanging from a bridge in Oregon temporarily blocked the freshly repaired Fennica from reaching the Pacific Ocean to return to Alaska.President Barack Obama \"must change the course on Arctic drilling set eight years ago by former President George W. Bush and not perpetuate it,\" said Michael Brune, head of the Sierra Club, the country's oldest environmental group.The club urged Obama to cancel sales of oil-zone leases scheduled for 2016 and 2017 and to remove the possibility of drilling in the Arctic Ocean.Later this month, Obama will visit Alaska to speak at a conference on the Arctic and tour areas threatened by climate change.Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, said the company \"looks forward to evaluating what could potentially become a national energy resource base.\"Shell is not releasing a timetable for its drilling program.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; editing by Sandra Maler; and Peter Galloway)"}, {"title": "Protesters Confront John McCain During Visit To Navajo Capital", "text": "Adriano Tsinigine, 17, wore his finest traditional jewelry -- a turquoise necklace, stamped silver and turquoise bowguard, and watch -- for the Navajo Code Talker Day festivities in Window Rock, Arizona, this past Friday. He was there partly to honor his late great-grandfather Wilford Buck, a Navajo code talker who served during World War II.But the high school senior also wanted to make a political statement -- about Congress' sale of Oak Flat, a section of Arizona's Tonto National Forest that Apache consider holy land, to foreign mining conglomerates.After the parade and gathering of state and tribal leaders -- who included Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) and Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye -- Tsinigine noticed that people were crowding around the politicians to pose for grip-and-grin photos.\"I thought, OK, here's my chance,\" Tsinigine told The Huffington Post on Monday during his lunch break at the Navajo Preparatory School in Farmington, New Mexico. He asked McCain for a photo, and just as the senator was putting on his best politician's grin, Tsinigine produced a card that read, \"PROTECT OAK FLAT.\"Tsinigine said he offered to let McCain keep the card, but the senator refused.\"You have to leave,\" McCain, clearly unhappy, said as he pushed the card back into the young man's chest. Tsinigine chuckled and walked away.The senator has been the target of intense criticism by Native activists and their supporters after adding a rider this past December onto the National Defense Authorization Act that opened the Apache holy land to mining conglomerates Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.The photo of McCain posing with an Oak Flat protester and a short video of the exchange have gone viral.\"I was hoping to get a photo of at least McCain ... or one of the Arizona representatives\" in order to help raise awareness about the struggle to save Oak Flat, Tsinigine said.The photo-op was just one part of a particularly unwelcoming visit for McCain to Window Rock, the Navajo Nation capital.The senator, who has been a supporter of corporate mining interests, also encountered protesters chanting, \"Water is life!\" in the Navajo language and waving a banner that read, \"John McCain = Indian Killer.\" The protesters voiced concerns about water rights, especially following last week's Gold King Mine disaster, which contaminated the San Juan River with heavy metals -- including lead, arsenic and copper -- and continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of many on the already parched Navajo reservation.The protesters shouting, \"Get off our land!\" ran after McCain's vehicle as it left town.The Phoenix New Times, which first reported the story, characterized the encounter as McCain being \"chased off the Navajo Nation\" by protesters. However, McCain's office disputed the veracity of that headline.\"[McCain] certainly wasn't 'chased off' the reservation,'\" a spokesman for the senator's office told the Arizona newspaper. \"This small group of young protesters had no practical impact on his productive meetings with top tribal leaders on a range of key issues, including the EPA's recent Gold King Mine spill which threatens to contaminate the Navajo Nation's water supply. Senator McCain was also extremely proud to help honor the Navajo Code Talkers on behalf of all Arizonans -- their heroic service saved countless American and allied lives during World War II.\""}, {"title": "Rescued Baby Elephant Keeps Her Life, But Loses Her Family", "text": "A baby elephant who fell into a steep-sided watering hole in Africa was determined not to die."}, {"title": "Portraits Of Aging Dogs Tell Tails Of Lives Filled With Rich Experiences", "text": "Our best furry friends age and grow, but that doesn't make them any less lovely.Massachusetts photographer Amanda Jones has captured dogs' timeless charm in a poignant photo series.In her new book \"Dog Years: Faithful Friends, Then And Now,\" Jones features the portraits of 30 dogs as puppies alongside the portraits of their older canine selves.

StockeWickecheoke Creek, C1 Stream, Hunterdon County, New Jersey\"...it is also vandalism to wantonly destroy or to permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the United States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and dumping-grounds, we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and exterminate fishes, birds and mammal...But at last it looks as if our people were awakening.\"  Theodore Roosevelt, 1858-1919, 26th President of the United States\"Water will become the blue oil of the 21st Century.\"  United States Department of StateOn a Tuesday evening in late July, Dr. Tullis Onstott, Professor of Geosciences at Princeton University - and in 2007 named one of TIME Magazine's most influential people in the world - stood in front of the Hopewell Township, New Jersey, Board of Health and swore under oath to \"tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\"Onstott offered expert testimony citing the potential long-term cumulative impact on New Jersey's regional water supply should the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approve the construction of the proposed $1.2 billion PennEast pipeline slated to carry natural gas 114 miles from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania through the pristine upper reaches of the Delaware River Watershed to a terminus outside Trenton.Onstott's testimony was sobering.\"PennEast pipeline's proposed path would blast a trench through the heart of a region with the highest arsenic concentration in the state of New Jersey,\" he said, explaining in detail how the arsenic trapped in the rock beneath the thin soil could be released leading to the loss of potable ground water that supplies the rural and semi-rural communities of three hundred-year-old Hunterdon County; and one hundred-fifty-year-old Mercer County, home of Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary.Arsenic is designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a known carcinogen, and it is the single largest pollutant of wells and water supplies in the state of New Jersey.\"The proposed pipeline route crosses every aquifer recharge zone that provides drinking water to local communities and every wetland that discharges water into the Delaware Raritan Canal,\" said Onstott.\"These fractured rock aquifers,\" he added, \"are the sole source of water for the wells of hundreds of communities and farms. The aquifers are extremely sensitive to this type of construction because the six feet deep trench exposes the rock formation to air releasing the arsenic into the shallow water table. Even worse during the pipeline's operation, methane leakage and the current from its cathodic shield will continue to mobilize arsenic for decades to come. There is not that much groundwater here to begin with, and the rainfall in this part of the world is not that great either. Dilution of this arsenic from fresh water recharge will be limited.\"He concluded that, \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Pipelines Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) need to be made aware that certain types of hydro-geological conditions make large-scale natural gas pipelines fundamentally incompatible with the safety of the communities living near them and high arsenic fractured bedrock is one of them.\"\"Why?\" he asked, \"would the PennEast consortium risk the drinking water for thousands of people? They would have had to have been blind not to know this before they proposed their route.\"Map of Arsenic Concentration Courtesy of the NJDEPThe situation gets worse, according to Michael Pisauro, Policy Director at the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed, who also testified under oath. \"Streams classified as \"Category 1\" [C1] have been determined by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to be of the highest quality and deserving of the best protection, including stream buffers which are vital to protecting water quality. Trees are crucial in stabilizing water banks and \"you cannot remove them without effecting run off,\" he adds.After hearing Onstott and Pisauro's testimony, and testimony from four additional experts, a geologist, a medical doctor, a psychologist, and a lawyer, the Hopewell Township Board of Health unanimously passed a resolution, naming \"potential groundwater contamination, air quality degradation, surface water degradation and increased risk of physical and mental illness as some of the possible health risks involved,\" should the pipeline be built. Weeks earlier the Township banned PennEast partner, United Gas Industries (UGI), from surveying after they were discovered drilling bore holes on Baldpate Mountain, in the Ted Stiles Preserve overlooking the Delaware River nor far from Washington's Crossing State Park where founding father George Washington famously crossed the Delaware to fight the Battle of Trenton, crucial to the success of the Revolutionary War.Image of Delaware River from Baldpate MountainBecause so few landowners have allowed PennEast access to their property, the DEP itself advised PennEast that it could not apply for drilling and construction permits unless it gets more geologic information along the pipeline's route.\"Residents are terrified of losing their drinking water, but also water for their fields and their livestock,\" says Tom Gilbert of the New Jersey Conservation Fund, noting that the proposed pipeline route \"would affect 3000 acres of open space preserved with New Jersey tax dollars, and cross 88 waterways, many federally regulated C-1 blue line streams, the purest designation a waterway can earn.\"PennEast Pipeline, LLC, a limited liability corporation, is the umbrella for a powerful consortium of gas companies: Atlanta-based AGL Resources, Houston-based Spectra Energy Partners , New Jersey-based NJR , Long Island/New Jersey-based PSEG, South Jersey Gas Industries, and UGI Energy Services, a subsidiary of UGI Corporation, a global distributor of energy products.In addition, UGI Energy Services announced plans in May to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility in northern Pennsylvania to take advantage of the Marcellus Shale gas. Companies liquefy natural gas by cooling and condensing it, which makes it easier to ship over long distances and overseas. The LNG plant, which would include both liquefaction and local storage, is expected to be in full commercial operation by 2017, the same time-frame PennEast has set to complete its pipeline, making PennEast ripe for LNG exports, an assertion PennEast's spokesperson Patricia Kornick has consistently denied.When Kornick was asked about the negative impacts posed by the pipeline, particularly the potential loss of the only source of potable water for all six townships along the pipeline route, she said, \"Please appreciate that PennEast employs a seasoned team of safety, engineering, environmental, geologists and specialists...dedicated to examining all aspects associated with safely constructing and operating the pipeline while minimizing the impact to the community and environment. The team is conducting various studies to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the underlying geology of the proposed route and will assess any risks and develop applicable mitigation measures to ensure safe construction. PennEast is confident it will be able to adequately address these concerns.\"Trenching MachineA Tale of Two Farms: Part One\"The keywords to understand in Ms. Kornick's response are 'mitigation' and 'adequately address,'\" says Jacqueline Haut Evans, of Hunterdon County, a farmer and single mother of three, whose home lies in the path of the current pipeline. She, along with nearly 70 percent of private landowners on the projected pipeline route, has forbidden PennEast surveyors to enter her property.\"If you look up the definition of 'mitigation,' which means 'to cause something to be less harsh or to make it less severe or painful,' you already know PennEast is anticipating problems,\" she says.\"And,\" she adds. \"If the consortium of companies under the name PennEast needs a 100- foot right of way to accommodate construction of a 36\" diameter pipe and a 40 foot right of way permanently thereafter, how will they 'mitigate' the damage to my house with the pipeline currently slated to run next to my front porch? Even if PennEast moves the pipeline into my field, they've already ruined my soon-to-be certified organic farm. How do you 'adequately address' that or 'mitigate' my livelihood and the well-being of my children. I would no longer be able to farm to the extent I am farming and could lose my farmland assessment and organic certification along with the loss of income from breeding goats, ducks, geese, chickens and the sale of eggs, lamb and honey. Any blasting would kill the fish in my pond and require moving my entire farmstead, which I'm not sure is possible, forcing me to carry a financial burden I can't afford.\"Evans Children Outside Their Sheepfold, which is on the Pipeline Path\"I am told,\" says Evans, \"that I would feel the vibration of pressurized gas moving through the pipelines 24 hours a day. It would be a constant reminder that an explosion could happen at anytime. I can't imagine the impact it would have on my children's mental as well as physical health. They would see the destruction of their property from their bedrooms and our front door.\"PennEast consistently claims that the pipeline is not only safe, but that it will benefit consumers in southern New Jersey, who are in great need of natural gas. And while the gas itself won't be accessible to the towns through which the pipeline would be built, PennEast claims that the construction and the jobs created will economically enrich the region. Earlier this year, PennEast released an economic report and impact analysis prepared by Econsult Solutions and Drexel University School of Economics whose purpose is to \"quantify the economic benefits resulting from the Project.\"Says the report: \"The immediate construction and labor impacts of the Project are substantial and would greatly benefit local communities through construction, labor and project management jobs.\"Potential Loss of Property ValuesMercer County, New Jersey, resident, Jeffrey R. Shafer, PhD, a former economist in the Federal Reserve System and former Assistant Secretary and later Undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury for International Affairs, rebuts the report, saying that \"loss of property values (for affected landowners and their neighbors) is likely to be very large. The communities through which the pipeline would run in New Jersey are fundamentally different from those developed areas where economists have found relatively small valuation effects. For more than three decades this area has attracted those looking to preserve a small area of traditional farms and forest in the dense urban corridor between Washington D.C. and Boston. Much land has been preserved or protected through a range of programs, which have been paid for by contributions and by transfers of tax burden to other landowners in the community.\"\"Landowners, both farmers and residents,\" he adds, \"who have not entered these programs value and protect the land that they own. The result is a community in which the value of its special character is capitalized in property prices. Buyers looking for an undeveloped haven would not be attracted to the area where the pipeline runs and this value would be lost. And this pipeline cannot be taken in isolation. Other pipelines and development projects would add up and fundamentally change the character of the entire area.\"Piipeline Blowout near Appomattox, Virginia, 2008Michelle Byers, Executive Director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, echoes Shafer's concerns. On the Foundation's website she addresses the fact that the state of New Jersey is currently updating its master energy plan. Instead of 12 new pipelines proposed to bisect the state, she calls for a larger investment in renewables. \"There is not clear documentation that these new gas pipelines are needed in New Jersey. In fact, the opposite is most likely true,\" she says.\"A recent analysis conducted by Labyrinth Consulting Services - found that the proposed PennEast pipeline alone would result in a 53 percent surplus beyond current demand in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and concluded that gas is bound for other markets, including export overseas. The current rush to build multiple pipelines in New Jersey runs the risk of significantly over-building, resulting in supply that far exceeds actual needs.\"In the report, petroleum geologist and energy expert, Arthur E. Berman says, \"Based on current natural gas supply and demand in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, there is no apparent need for gas that would be transported via the PennEast pipeline.\"A Tale of Two Farms: Part TwoAngele and Brant Switzler's 50-acre farm in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, has been in the family for three generations, a farm they share with extended family. In early August, beneath a deep blue sky, Switzler sits in her living room as a PennEast survey plane circles her property taking photographs, making a loop over the neighborhood and returns, cutting the still air with an insistent loud drone.The Switzler's farm is a working farm with a fruit orchard and a large daylily field in cultivation for eventual sale of individual plants. The Switzlers rely on solar panels for electricity and a carbon capture wood burning stove for heat in the winter. According to PennEast's proposed route, the pipeline easement would cut through the orchard, the daylily field, and the solar panels.On May 15, Switzler, a gifted painter trained at the Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, woke up with what she assumed was another migraine. \"The headaches had been occurring on a regular basis since I first became anxious and threatened by the prospect of the PennEast Pipeline cutting through the entire length of my property, destroying a woodland and wetland in addition to farmland,\" she says.Switzler, like her neighbors in rural Delaware Township has refused surveyors access to her property. \"In April the survey company called me every day,\" she says. \"A man with a southern accent kept telling me that he had very important new information I should know, information I would be privy to, only when I allowed them to come survey. Even more upsetting, at a PennEast informational dinner in April, a land agent showed me a map of the route through my property in which they had deleted my house.\"\"It was doubly upsetting,\" she adds. \"Because at an earlier meeting, I sat down with another land agent and went through a map of my property with him. And that map contained my house. We marked what was important to my husband and me - a 150-year-old oak tree, the orchard, the solar panels, the location of my well and where my septic system is buried - with yellow arrows and noted everything with the coordinate.The second land agent who told me my house was missing wasn't even fazed by the deletion. He simply said, 'Well Google Earth doesn't always have the house on it.'\"\"How is that possible when my house predates Google Earth?\" she wonders. \"The agent said that unless I let them on my property they might well use a Google Earth map, threatening by implication that they might route the pipeline directly through my house. It is unfathomable that in order to explain the stress and sorrow this has put on my husband, my kids and myself, I have to remind pro-pipeline advocates what \"home\" means to most people. Home is sometimes the only investment and financial security a family like ours has.\"Switzler's headache was not a migraine, but a brain hemorrhage, which left her paralyzed and in the hospital for eight weeks. \"Ironically,\" she says, on the day I returned home from the hospital, three surveyors were at the edge of my property with survey equipment.Surveyor on the Edge of the Switzler Farm 70% of Landowners in New Jersey Have Refused Survey Access to their PropertiesSwitzler, who now walks unsteadily and has lost some of the fine motor skills she needs to paint, adds, \"It has always been clear to impacted land owners that this is nothing more than a company saying, 'We stand to make millions of dollars from fracked gas. Your land is in our way. We will lobby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to give us permission to use Eminent Domain, so that we can take your land and there is nothing you can do about it. We don't have to concern ourselves with your rights or feelings. So comply.'\"At issue, she adds, \"are some of the most fundamental rights of citizens - the right to own property, the right to clean water and the right to protect natural environments. Each time land grabs occur, precedents are being set. There are 12 pipelines in the works in New Jersey. Other energy consortiums are following the PennEast project with interest. I was not on the route a month ago, and I might not be on the route ultimately. This is a moving target. The process is an expedited farce in favor of gas companies, not citizens.\"As the scoping process continues, all the townships along the Delaware River are listening to her and her neighbors. At the Delaware Township meeting held on August 10, the room was filled to overflowing with residents of all ages. Following the example of every single township in New Jersey in the path of the pipeline, the Delaware Township committee presented a resolution. Among the points were these:1. The taxpayers of 36.67 square mile rural Delaware Township, one hour from New York City and one hour from Philadelphia, in partnership with County, Federal and non-profit agencies, has invested $15, 414, 546.60 in the preservation of 2,146 acres of open space and farmland that is treasured by thousands of visitors each year from neighboring states and across the country, giving a boost to the economy and to the local farms and restaurants.2. New Jersey Conservation Foundation, who has partnered with the township in preserving open space, learned that PennEast surveyors entered land owned by the Foundation and Hunterdon Land Trust without the permission of the owner. On July 30, the Foundation issued an order to \"cease and desist unauthorized entry and survey activities.After hundreds of meetings in which neighbors got to know and respect one another for their love of one of the most historic and beautiful places in the U.S., and for their pragmatic response to a pipeline they believe is redundant; and with an understanding that the battle to save their land will ultimately rest with the Federal Government, a cheer rippled through the room when the Delaware Township Committee unanimously passed its resolution to deny PennEast survey access on any and all Township-owned lands.PennEast plans to submit its formal application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September.\"I painted \"Artifact\" in my studio on my Hunterdon County farm,\" says Angele Switzler. \"It's a representation of a very small arrowhead I keep there.

Unfortunately, the drive of the conservatives in Tokyo to develop an assertive conventional military, something they consider to be a prerequisite to status as a \"normal country\" has resulted in an exponential rise in political tensions in East Asia and deep questions about what Japan's long-term motives are.Many within Japan itself question the rationale for such a rapid push to beef up the Japanese military, slough off the restrictions on military action dictated by the peace constitution and put Japan on a path to serving as a major supplier of weapons technology with a military that is activel engaged around the world.Towards this goal Japan has embraced the ambiguous concept of \"collective defense\" which allows it to interpret its way out of the completely unambiguous Article Nine of the Constitution: \"land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.\"Japanese conservatives suggest that Japan needs to shoulder its international responsibilities as a member of the G-7 and become a \"normal nation\" that can project military force. Although, in fact, Japan, with the seventh largest military budget, has gone already far beyond any normal nation in terms of its spending.I can certainly understand the desire of the Japanese to be leaders and play a central role in international affairs. After all, Japan has a powerful economy, some of the most advanced technology and a remarkable cultural tradition. But the Japanese need to ask themselves a serious question: will Japan be a more of a global leader if it abandons its peace constitution, or if it embraces it and enhances it?Many frown on any suggestions that the peace constitution might be relevant to our age. Recently, Robert Dujarric, a leading Japan security expert, went as far as to write that, \"Article 9...is incompatible with surviving in a dangerous world. It's a noble aspiration but is not policy-relevant.\"But what exactly is incompatible about the \"peace constitution\" and survival? Without any doubt the greatest threat today is from climate change, which will devastate the major coastal cities of Asia, dramatically reduce food productivity and make large regions of the world uninhabitable. A recent study headed by James Hansen, the former director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, suggests that staying within the internationally agreed goal of keeping the planet within the 2 degree Celsius temperature warming limit will not avoid the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland glaciers. The inevitable result will be the flooding of numerous major cities, like Tokyo, Shanghai and Busan, with seawater.A \"peace constitution\" could be a major advantage to Japan as it works together with nations around the world to respond to this existential threat. For example, the peace constitution would force the country to dedicate its resources to emerging non-security threats, thereby making it far more prepared for the challenges of climate change because it does not spend as much on tanks and planes and other technologies that are not relevant to survival in a warming world. The result would not be a Japan that is not punching its weight in military affairs, but rather a Japan that is truly a leader for the first time in security issues.Japan already has the advanced technologies related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, solar and wind power, electric batteries, and other systems for responding to an increasingly inhospitable environment.Rather than trying to model Japan's security strategy on that of the United States, a country that is in serious trouble because of its military over-extension, Japan should move in a more constructive direction, focusing on the one security threat that all experts agree on.The Self-defense forces could be transformed into organizations that fully support the import of article nine, rather than contradict it, and thereby become models for positive institutional innovation.For example, the future Ground Self-Defense Force could focus on the global battle against desertification and mass its resources to address the degradation of land and the destruction of forests around the world.The Maritime Self-Defense Force could focus its attention on addressing the rising temperature of the ocean and the threat posed to the world by its growing acidification. The Self-Defense Force could also give attention to humanitarian relief related to climate change and stopping the dangerous overfishing of the oceans. Finally, the Air Self-Defense Force could devote its resources to the surveying the impact of global warming from the air and addressing problems related to the atmosphere.It is no simple task to reinvent military. But it is not the first time in history that new circumstances have forced a radical rethinking of security priorities. Better to look at this challenge as an opportunity for Japan to return to its tradition of brave innovation and institutional reform. Finally, such a security strategy requires close engagement with nations throughout Asia and around the world that could make Japan the center of a new security network dedicated to this emerging threat.The move beyond a conventional military is not an unrealistic pacifist impulse, but rather a historic decision by Japan to address the changing nature of security directly. Although Japan did not have had full autonomy to choose the peace constitution, Japan can chose its destiny this time, positioning itself to lead as nations around the world re-calibrate to address the threat of climate change.This article was originally published in Asia Today"}, {"title": "The California Drought Is So Bad, It Might Be Killing The Giant Sequoia", "text": "A full-grown giant sequoia is a thirsty tree. In the height of summer, the millenia-old behemoths, some of which grow upwards of 30 stories tall, can guzzle 500 to 800 gallons of water per day. They can also survive a variety of scourges that would fell an inferior conifer -- beetles, wildfires, storms. But scientists are worried the species may have met its match in the ongoing California drought.Nate Stephenson, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, was walking through the woods last year when he noticed some of the trees he'd been studying for decades had dropped most of their leaves. He joined forces with other researchers from the USGS, as well as from the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, to launch a comprehensive health study on the sequoia.Anthony Ambrose, a tree ecologist at University of California, Berkeley, led a recent bout of fieldwork to monitor how stressed the sequoia have been, and if, in fact, we should be worried about their longevity. A few weeks from now, his team plans to collect a slew of samples from more than 50 trees that have dropped up to 75 percent of their leaves. He hopes the research can provide real-time data to forest managers who can prioritize care for threatened trees.\"There are a lot of trees that are dying, a lot of pines and cedars that have died because of the drought,\" Ambrose told The Huffington Post. \"The giant sequoia seem to be pretty resistant, but we want to know what does it take to kill one of these and what can we learn from this.\"Koren Nydick, a lead author of the study, spoke with Ezra David Romero of NPR affiliate Valley Public Radio about the prospect of a drought felling the giants. Nothing's been corroborated by science yet, but it's clear something unusual is bothering the trees.\"The good news is that there were lots of trees that still seem healthy, but there was this smaller amount that seemed to be stressed and stressed in ways that we haven't seen documented before in the parks,\" Nydick said.Ambrose said many of these trees have undeniably gone through drought before -- the oldest among them can live to more than 3,000 years old. But opportunities to study a drought like this one don't happen often, and can provide insights into a tree's capacity for hardship.\"Every organism has a limit,\" Ambrose said. \"Every organism has a threshold beyond which it can't survive anymore.\"The punishing drought in California is about to stretch into its fifth year. The state suffered through its driest January on record this year and officials have been struggling to come up with innovative water-saving methods, including the recent introduction of millions of \"shade balls\" to cover a reservoir. But many scientists are worried about how the water shortage will affect many ecological elements of the state, including residents' lawns to farmers' fields.Listen to NPR's story on the sequoia below."}, {"title": "From a March to a Movement: Mobilizing More Than Greens for Climate Action", "text": "In September 2014, something monumental happened. Around the world, people took to the streets. In New York City alone, 400,000 people of faith, communities of color and indigenous communities, labor unions, youth groups and other organizations marched to demand action on climate. But that public outpouring of support was only the beginning. In the months since, we've been quietly but concertedly building on the success of the People's Climate March.Now we're taking the organizing muscle that brought half a million people around the globe to the streets and ramping up the ongoing efforts to involve local communities while doubling down on the effort to bring in even more of the groups who don't traditionally work on environmental issues. The People's Climate Movement is organizing to mobilize people from all walks of life for a National Day of Action on October 14.By going to PeoplesClimate.org, you can sign up to lead an event in your community like a rally or march, or see how you can join an event already planned in your community. And because Congress will be in their home districts that week, it's a perfect time to meet with your elected officials.Because, to show politicians we're serious, we need more than a march -- we need a movement. We don't need one group or one constituency; we need many groups, many people, and many voices. Movement building is never over, and what we've built to date is strong and growing. There's room for everyone in the People's Climate Movement.Whether it's people of faith heeding Pope Francis's moral call to action, people of color marching to protect their communities or unions and working families fighting for green jobs, or business owners looking to protect their livelihoods, the National Day of Action will show everyone that climate change affects people from all walks of life -- even as we recognize that the impacts of climate change will not be evenly felt. No longer is climate change a niche issue; people from every part of the planet need to act. As we say, when trying to change everything, we need everyone. Everywhere.When we all raise our voices and hit the streets on October 14, we will send a clear message to politicians that delay is deadly in the face of the growing threat of climate change and will not be tolerated. We will gather in communities across the country to demand that the United States live up to its potential and fulfill its promise as a global clean energy leader. Because when we push our technological limits and break new ground, we make ourselves stronger and the whole world takes note.The good news is that with each passing day, renewable energy gets cheaper. We can scale up clean energy even more quickly with smart government support. Fast action is critical, because the sooner we act, the less damage we'll endure.Sadly, that damage will be most keenly felt by impoverished people and economically disadvantaged communities of color. That's why so many social justice campaigners are putting their strength into the climate fight. For example, the Katrina 10 Week of Action is bringing together a variety of groups, bolstering the strength and leadership of frontline communities. Climate change is not just an environmental issue. It's a social justice issue.Making progress on climate change is going to take all of us together, across the U.S. and around the world. And that's a good thing, because a new clean energy economy means new jobs and new industries. Which means action on climate is action on the economy, opening up new opportunities for tech jobs and manufacturing alike.The timing for this rising tide of climate concern couldn't be better, because in December, the UN will hold climate negotiations in Paris, and this negotiating session is expected to produce an international compact. For the agreement to be strong, we need leaders to hear that people of all backgrounds are demanding bold climate action.That means they need to hear from low-income communities and communities of color about protection from extreme weather. They need to hear from people of faith about the moral imperative for climate action. And they need to hear from labor groups about the prosperity promised by the clean energy economy. So join the National Day of Climate Action, and help us carry on the legacy of the March into a whole new movement -- one that demands action on behalf of all of us, and to the benefit of everyone. After all, Earth is full of lots of different people with different concerns, but we all share the same planet.

The Model 3 is expected to begin production in 2017.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Jonas, who is known for taking provocative, forward-looking stances on the auto industry, predicted in April that self-driving fleets of electric vehicles will eventually replace individual car ownership. In a chart embedded in a memo to clients, he described what he said will be a shift from fossil-fueled, human-driven, privately owned cars to electric, self-driving armadas owned by ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft.Or, as Jonas now posits, Tesla.The automaker would have to clear a few hurdles before it could do what Jonas is describing. The company is spending aggressive amounts of cash as it prepares to release the Model X, its first SUV and third vehicle overall. Tesla is also building a $5 billion battery manufacturing plant, dubbed the Gigafactory, in Nevada. Without it, the more affordable Model 3 cannot be mass-produced.The auto industry is locked in an arms race over the future of driving. Tech giants, including Google and possibly Apple, are competing to build self-driving technology. Traditional automakers like Mercedes-Benz and General Motors are scrambling to wow audiences with their own entrants to the market. Somewhere in between, there's Tesla.\"100 percent of Tesla's cars are electric, connected, and able to 'learn' through over-the-air firmware updates at any time,\" Jonas wrote. \"No other established automaker can claim this today. As we have written for some time, we expect all car companies would eventually see nearly 100 percent of their revenues shift from the sale of human-driven/individually-owned cars to robot-driven/shared cars.\"The need for such vehicles is pressing. Ideally, self-driving cars -- free from human input, and thus human error -- would reduce traffic congestion and accidents. Perhaps more importantly, vehicles modeled after Tesla's would help reduce the carbon emissions spewed into the atmosphere every time a car is in use. Cars and trucks account for one-fifth of all U.S. emissions, according to the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.\"If Tesla wants to make good on its mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable transport, we see the move to a shared mobility model as critical,\" Jonas wrote. \"Tesla has been the most outspoken auto company on the use of autonomous technology to improve inefficiencies and safety of today's road transport.\"Tesla stock soared to over $255 Monday morning after Jonas' note went out."}, {"title": "These Dogs Make It Easier To Testify In Front Of Your Attacker In Court", "text": "Everyone deserves to be heard, and these dogs are helping some witnesses find their voice."}, {"title": "What It Takes To Win Against New Gas Pipelines: Lessons from New York, Georgia and Kentucky", "text": "Over the last few years, a major new front has developed in the fight against climate change: stopping new fossil fuel pipelines. Across the United States, climate advocates are joining hands with local communities and mobilizing against dangerous, polluting and unnecessary new pipelines, many of them meant to carry natural gas.Fracking has flooded domestic markets with gas, at least temporarily, and gas companies are building new pipelines as fast as they can in order to get their product to lucrative markets in Europe and Asia. Here in Massachusetts, we're fighting five major pipeline projects: Northeast Direct (Kinder Morgan), Connecticut Expansion (Kinder Morgan), Algonquin Incremental Market (Spectra), Atlantic Bridge (Spectra) and Access Northeast (Spectra), not to mention all their attendant locals, laterals and loops. And that's just one state!If you've ever had to fight against a new gas pipeline, you know it's not exactly easy. There are a half-dozen different agencies involved, all with their own alphabet-soup names (FERC, EFSB, DOER, DPU). It can be near-impossible to figure out who has real decision-making authority over any particular project. Crucial information is often buried on obscure government websites or hidden in reams of documents, and opportunities for community input are scheduled at the last minute and held during business hours in faraway government buildings.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is supposed to be the ultimate authority in charge of new pipelines, usually acts as little more than a rubber stamp; it's been years since they last turned down a pipeline application. Some new gas pipelines are already under construction, despite massive opposition from local residents and environmental, faith, social justice, public health and community groups, and regulators have already given a green light to many others. At this point, many of us are starting to wonder: is it ever possible to win against fossil fuel companies and their allies? Can communities ever beat back new pipelines?The short answer: yes. Dedicated grassroots organizing and persistent advocacy can stop new pipelines -- even against seemingly impossible odds.One example is the Constitution pipeline, currently delayed and perhaps permanently stalled by grassroots opposition. The Constitution pipeline would run from Pennsylvania through New York and ultimately connect to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Williams, an energy company, is leading the push to build the pipeline; they went through the FERC process and got the usual thumbs-up in December 2014.But grassroots leaders were not ready to accept \"yes\" as an answer. With the support of 59 local groups, people from all 125 miles of the proposed pipeline route continued organizing to put pressure on the state of New York. In response, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) requested more time to consider the water quality permit necessary for construction to begin. It's up in the air whether the DEC will grant the permit in the end, but they behaved similarly before placing a moratorium on fracking in 2008; they continuously extended their timeline as the grassroots opposition movement grew until they finally reached a decision in favor of the public interest. This may suggest a precedent for turning Williams down.Another victory comes from Georgia. If built, Kinder Morgan's Palmetto pipeline would cut through South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The pipeline is meant to carry petroleum, but as an interstate pipeline, it has to go through many of the same permitting processes as natural gas pipelines. From the beginning, landowners along the pipeline route have been refusing to let surveyors onto their land, and the Push Back the Pipeline coalition has been representing concerned communities throughout Georgia and South Carolina. Unsurprisingly, FERC approved the construction of the Palmetto pipeline in May, the same month that both the Republican Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Georgia came out in opposition to the project. Later that month, the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that it was denying Kinder Morgan its certificate of public necessity -- a permit needed for eminent domain rights. This means that for now, the project is dead in the water, unless Kinder Morgan is able to negotiate with every individual landowner along the route or unless they win their appeal challenging the DOT. With the help of Georgians, South Carolina residents are now pushing their  state government to oppose the Palmetto pipeline in any way possible.Another example can be found deep in Kentucky. The Bluegrass liquified natural gas pipeline was \"indefinitely delayed\" after landowners, environmentalists, students, and nuns formed a coalition to stop the pipeline. Local political leaders from both sides of the aisle teamed up to push for a bill that would make eminent domain inaccessible to fossil fuel pipelines. After multiple court battles related to eminent domain and the Bluegrass pipeline, an appeals court upheld the claim that Bluegrass has no right to eminent domain in the state of Kentucky. The grassroots and political opposition to this project ultimately led to \"slower than expected commitments\" from utilities to purchase the gas. With that blow, Williams, the company leading the charge, backed away from the project. If this kind of victory is possible in the heart of coal-country Kentucky, then we can truly win anywhere we have the courage to stand up, the organization to be effective, and the determination to never give up.Indeed, whether you are trying to keep Spectra Energy out of Rhode Island, Kinder Morgan out of Massachusetts, Dominion out of Maryland, or Carso out of Texas, the lesson is the same: when people rise up and demand that their voice be heard, local representatives and agencies have no choice but to listen. Together, we can go after corrupt energy companies and their allies at FERC -- and together, we can win.

You probably don't since good information is hard to come by, but Joshua Kasteler and Safe Ducky can help you find out with one simple test.Kasteler, 40, spent several years in Asia as a chemical engineer. Part of his job was to test products on the assembly lines for toxicity, often weeding out those that had high levels of toxins such as lead, mercury and phthalates, among others. But he quickly learned that harmful chemicals can often slip through the manufacturing and distribution process and end up in the consumer products we buy in the U.S.So Kasteler decided he could do something about it. He recently moved from Boston to Los Angeles, and he's started a company called Safe Ducky. Its sole mission is to find out what children's products on the shelves now are safe and which ones are not.\"We don't know much about the chemicals that we expose ourselves and our children to every day,\" say Kasteler (left, testing for toxins). \"We bring home toys and clothing without knowing how they were made, and the fact is, some of those items may have toxic chemicals in them.\"Kasteler says the biggest risk factors for toxic products come from three areas: offshore manufacturing, lack of oversight in the manufacturing process itself and limited testing.\"Most products today are not made by the company listed on the label,\" he says, \"but by offshore contract manufacturers. While many of these factories are responsible businesses, the lack of supervision in some of these remote factories can allow for gaps in safety.\"Kasteler created Safe Ducky to test children's products right in the store, the first time the consumer comes in direct contact with them. The Safe Ducky process takes a product off the shelf and runs a test with sophisticated portable scanners that allow Kasteler to see the chemical content. In a matter of seconds a read out will tell him--and the store owner--whether or not that product is safe.Products with toxins over the legal limit are immediately removed from the shelves. Then the store owner and the Safe Ducky team go back to the manufacturer to work out a solution to the problem. When all toxic products have been removed, the store is placed on the Safe Ducky website (www.safeducky.com) , which indicates it is safe for parents to shop there.This ground level testing is in sharp contrast to the testing that goes on--or doesn't--at the national level.The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged by the federal government with testing all imports for harmful chemicals. But the CPSC is woefully underfunded and undermanned. There are only about 500 employees for the entire country, and the budget is only $155 million a year. By contrast, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a $3.2 billion budget and employs 40,000 people.In 2013 the CPSC examined only 0.07 per cent of products imported to the United States, with half of those inspections made for toys. As far back as 2006 Michael P. Wilson, then a Professor of the School of Public Health at UC Berkeley, warned the U.S. Congress that the U.S. may fall behind the rest of the world without stronger consumer protection against toxic chemicals.It is possible that pending legislation in Congress will tighten up the testing oversight this fall as the Congress debates the first update to the Toxic Substances Control Act in 40 years. Both industry and consumer groups are working hard to press their point of viewKasteler is on the right track by taking the process to the local level, where he provides information for both families and retailers about product safety for the products they buy right next door. But he may also be in the vanguard of a new movement to empower consumers everywhere to be more aware of chemical hazards in other things they buy every day.\"This reminds me of that famous clip on YouTube about the guy dancing alone at a rock concert,\" he says. \"Sure, it takes courage to dance by yourself, but it's the first supporter who decides to join the dance that transforms him from that 'crazy dancing guy' to a 'movement'.\"Kasteler and Safe Ducky clearly intend to become part of that movement."}, {"title": "How One Photographer Found Peace And Freedom On The Road", "text": "Last year at just 20 years old, Paris-based photographer Sidi-Omar Alami knew he needed to make a substantial life change.

A study by Goldman Sachs predicts that, as a result, the Chinese environmental market could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity.As pollution in China reaches crisis proportions, leading to a drag on the economy and a rise in social unrest, the government is taking bold steps to remedy the \"airpocalypse\" situation through a full-scale \"war on pollution.\" One of the biggest challenges, however, will be the ability to finance this green revolution.China expects implementation of the measures in the plan to cost at least U.S. $1 trillion every year for at least the next five years. And the government estimates that it can cover only about 15 percent of that price tag. The government has begun to explore how to create innovative financing vehicles in both the private and public sectors to attract the necessary capital -- and technologies. The environmental reform plans will provide excellent opportunities for foreign financial institutions involved and interested in promoting sustainability.Green finance is the latest catchphrase being used by Beijing, but it is also a full-scale initiative, with the People's Bank of China chairing the newly created Green Finance Committee, which brings together China's public and private sectors to explore viable options. The committee has 85 members representing Chinese financial institutions, clean energy companies, private equity companies and sovereign funds. The Paulson Institute has partnered with the committee to explore how innovative US technologies can help in the fight against pollution.Beijing has outlined a four-part plan to create the framework to promote green finance:Institution building: It will continue to build capacity in existing financial institutions for green finance, including further development of criteria for green lending for major state lenders. The establishment of provincial-level green banks is under consideration on a test-case basis.Policy measures: China is exploring different policy actions to promote green lending and sustainable practices. Central to this effort is the intention to launch a green bond market.Market measures: China hopes to use market forces to attract capital into the green market. Plans are being finalised to unite the seven regional pilot carbon markets into a unified national carbon market. In addition, China plans to create a green rating system that would complement the traditional credit rating system for companies.Legal infrastructure: China intends to upgrade the legal infrastructure to support green finance, especially in compliance. Combined with the strengthening of environmental protection laws and the promotion of legal remedies against polluters, China plans to hold financial institutions responsible - and potentially liable - if they lend to projects or companies that pollute.One of the biggest challenges in implementing this reform agenda is the lack of trained personnel.Capacity building, especially in finance, will be essential. Non-governmental organisations can play an important role in developing programmes to train financial experts and policymakers on sustainability and green finance.Cleaning China's air, water and soil has become an economic and social imperative.

These developments center around a real, functional farm as their crown jewel. According to CivilEats, there are currently about 200 of them nationwide.The latest, called The Cannery, officially opened this past Saturday on a site that was previously home to a tomato cannery facility located about a mile outside downtown Davis, California. The 100-acre project of the New Home Company development company is considered to be the first agrihood to take root on formerly industrial land. All of its 547 energy-efficient homes will be solar-powered and electric car-ready, KCRA, NBC’s Sacramento affiliate, reports.The Cannery is unique for other reasons, too. The community’s 7.4-acre farm will be managed by the Center for Land-Based Learning, a nonprofit group that plans to run agricultural education programs for students and aspiring farmers from the site in addition to a commercial operation focusing on organic vegetables once they’ve raised money for farm equipment and improved the soil, CivilEats reports.There is a cost to all of this, of course. Homes in The Cannery range from the mid-$400,000s to just over $1 million, according to the Sacramento Bee. The median sales price for listings in the market is $524,000, toward the lower end of that range.While the term “agrihood” may be relatively new, the concept is not. As Modern Farmer pointed out in a 2014 story, the broader concept has roots dating back to the mid-1800s. The nation’s first planned community, in Riverside, Illinois, had a decidedly pastoral feel falling somewhere in the middle of city and country life.And many established agrihoods have been around for some time, such as the Agritropia community in Gilbert, Arizona, the Serenbe development outside Atlanta and Prairie Crossing in Grayslake, Illinois, all of which were established over a decade ago and appear to be flourishing.While some have criticized the developments as an attempt at greenwashing in order to find buyers for locations that would otherwise be less popular, the trend is not showing signs of slowing down.“The foodie generation has come of age,” Ed McMahon of the Urban Land Institute told Bloomberg this year. “The mainstream development community has come to think of these as a pretty good way to build a low-cost amenity that people seem to like and that also adds authenticity.”Newer agrihood developments include the Sendero village of Rancho Mission Viejo in Orange County, California, and the Kukui’ula community in Kauai, Hawaii.\"I yearn, and I think a lot of people yearn, for the Earth to be connected with the source of our food,” a Sendero resident told the Los Angeles Times last year. \"To get your hands dirty with growth ...

She weaves and repairs it.\"Bourgeois was obsessed with the spider -- its patience, its resolve, its spindly legs and hairy abdominal sac. Its ability to be at once comforting and threatening, feared and afraid. Bourgeois is one of many women artists past and present whose work addresses the natural world. An exhibition profiling 23 such artists, entitled \"Super Natural\" is currently on view at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.Perhaps the long-running love affair between women and the wild stems from women's natural ability to sustain life or, as chief curator Kathryn Wat suggests, because women were often encouraged to study plants based on their perceptiveness and appreciation of beauty.That being said, any viewer expecting genteel renderings of flora and fauna will be gravely disappointed. As Bourgeois' paradoxical spider makes perfectly clear, the \"Super Natural\" artworks don't just skim the surfaces of picturesque landscapes; rather, they scrutinize nature-scapes real and imagined, digging past the exterior to unearth the growth, decay and unbridled power underneath.Bourgeois, for example, with her drawing \"Hairy Spider,\" melds a biological illustration with a family photo album, imbuing the often overlooked arachnid with personal and psychological significance.\"Why the spider?\" Bourgeois once explained. \"Because my best friend was my mother and she was deliberate, clever, patient, soothing, reasonable, dainty, subtle, indispensable, neat and as useful as a spider. She could also defend herself, and me, by refusing to answer ‘stupid’, inquisitive, embarrassing, personal questions. I shall never tire of representing her.\"Bourgeois' mother, like the spider, was a deft weaver, working in the family business of tapestry restoration. She also provided food for her family of six and served as a gentle protector, quite like a spider's web.Throughout her artistic career, Bourgeois rendered spiders big and small; some were drawings delicate and flat, others steel sculptures towering up to 35 feet in the air. The ritual of drawing too, for Bourgeois, echoed the daily practice of the creature. \"What is a drawing? It is a secretion, like a thread in a spider’s web,\" she said. \"It is a knitting, a spiral, a spider web and other significant organizations of space.\"In \"Super Natural,\" Bourgeois is joined by artists including 17th-century Swiss artist-naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian, who raised and studied her own insects and, notably, worked and traveled without a male companion. Then there's the almighty Ana Mendieta, a Cuban performance artist known for her \"earth-body\" sculptures, or siluetas, sculptural interventions that fold anatomy into topography, her human silhouette molded to resemble ancient Mexican goddesses. Mendieta's \"Volcano Series\" features a particular silueta made from gunpowder and sugar, which she set on fire and let burn.Of the more contemporary set, Peggy Johnston’s 2011 \"Reptalien\" reinterprets the natural history book by physically transforming it into a reptilian beast, alluding to the impossibility of capturing an animal's spirit in words. And Australian artist Patricia Piccinini delivers \"The Stags,\" two motor scooters bearing an uncanny resemblance to mutant slugs, hinting at a future in which nature and technology are fully enmeshed.The artists of \"Super Natural\" are well aware of the beauty and magic of mother nature. They're also, however, just as interested in its uncontrollable power, to both create and destroy, its teeming diversity and inextricable relationship to decay. Please go see the radical ways women past and present have expressed their undying fascination with Mother Earth.

Photo via Wikimedia Commons.)Through all four seasons, the Great Lakes provides a vast array of recreational opportunities that connect more than 40 million people who live in its basin, and the countless others who flock to its shores from around the world. While public policy, a trillion dollar economy and critical conservation issues connect all who take pride in the Great Lakes, this month we take a look at how the five bodies of water foster fun, inspiration and relaxation through a host of recreational opportunities. Stay tuned for future posts in our series, \"Great Lakes, Amazing Connections,\" to learn more about the ways the Great Lakes bring us together.Staring north on the shore of Lake Michigan from Museum Campus in Chicago, there's something in the water that competes for your attention as you look toward the city's iconic skyline: It's people! Thousands of them filling the lake's vast horizon with a skyline of their own that includes sail boats, jet skis, luxury crafts, fishing rigs and tour liners. On the surrounding land, runners, walkers, cyclists and families on a stroll take advantage of the picturesque scenery provided by the lake.Summer -- perhaps more than any other season -- allows us to step back and celebrate the vast array of recreational opportunities the Great Lakes provide, and the memories they help us form. In Chicago, it's watching the Chicago Yacht Club's sail boat race to Mackinac Island each year or as I'm literally doing right now, watching the world-famous Blue Angles fighter jets prepare for this weekend's Chicago Air & Water Show. Michigan -- surrounded by Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior -- offers the chance to hike the 400-foot high Sleeping Bear Dunes or kayaking through any number of inland lakes and costal bays. Across the border, Ontario's network of nearly 35,000 square-miles of provincial parks -- many of which border Lake Ontario -- offer an abundance of opportunities for fishing, camping and bird watching.Our appreciation of the lakes as a source of R&R underscores yet another reason why they are such a vital asset that connects us all. Our summers on the Great Lakes sustain more than 200,000 jobs, and pump $16 billion into the economy annually on boating and equipment alone. And because our play creates work, it's vital we remember how important it is to keep the lakes healthy and vibrant so generations to come can enjoy it as we have.Beyond simple pleasure, those who recreate on our waters have also created powerful stories using the lakes as their backdrops. In 2014, five men from Traverse City set out on a 60-mile paddleboard trip across Lake Michigan in an effort to raise money and awareness for Great Lakes conservation. In just one day in July, a trio of adventurous swimmers from Canada set out to swim in all of the Great Lakes in a single July day, and a New Jersey woman set off in June to paddle 2,000 miles of water to bring attention to water quality issues in the United States. And finally, let's not forget the Great Lakes offer some incredible fresh water surfing -- yes surfing. Of course with surfing, rowing, swimming, or any other recreation on the Great Lakes, it's important to be responsible and the Great Lakes Surf and Rescue Project is a great place to start.Stories like these, coupled with our own experiences in any of the five lakes, are wonderful examples of just how much we not only rely on them to sustain us physically, but emotionally as well. No matter how we choose to enjoy the lakes, the ample opportunities for recreation ensure there is a like-minded community we can connect and share with.The lakes prove that, even when stepping away from the watery horizon of Lake Michigan into the offices of Shedd Aquarium, they provide lingering reminders of all they have to offer. Just glancing at social media like Facebook and Twitter, families and friends are sharing their summers full of enjoying the Great Lakes. From pictures of friends bringing their newborns to the beaches of Lake Eerie for the first time, or family posing for photos at a beach barbecue, the lakes serve as an important reminder of the memories they can make simply by allowing us to enjoy them.Seeing these is a particular joy to me. With Shedd being a leader in conservation and research into these lakes that sustain our appetite for recreation, it's my hope that we all put as much passion into keeping them a healthy, thriving system as we do while spending our time off enjoying them.Have you spent any time relaxing and recreating by the lakes this summer? I'd love to see your photos!

On August 11th, the Associated Press reported that:The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said... her department takes full responsibility for spilling 3 million gallons of mining waste that turned a southwest Colorado river an unnatural shade of orange, adding it \"pains me to no end.\"... State and local officials in the areas affected by the spill have characterized EPA's initial response as too slow and too small. It took about 24 hours to first notify some downstream communities of the accident and the agency originally underestimated the volume of the spill.Senator James Inhofe, Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, put down his climate change-denying snowball long enough to make sure that EPA knew it would be held accountable for the mistake. Sadly, EPA made a bad target for his wrath, since EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy had already accepted responsibility and was moving quickly to prevent similar accidents in the future.The problem is that there are thousands of these abandoned mines throughout the west and many of them are filled with the toxic residue of the mining process. According to an Associated Press report on August 9th:Experts estimate there are 55,000 such abandoned mines from Colorado to Idaho to California, and federal and state authorities have struggled to clean them for decades. The federal government says 40 percent of the headwaters of Western waterways have been contaminated from mine runoff.Most of the mines have been abandoned for many years. The mine that leaked toxics last week has not been active since 1923. Our past practice of ignoring the environmental impact of our economic activities continues to come back to haunt us--and the process of dealing with this poisonous legacy is far from over. The toxic waste cleanup Superfund program was enacted in 1980 following a study that estimated there were between 30,000 and 50,000 abandoned toxic waste sites in the United States. And that estimate did not include the 55,000 abandoned mines mentioned above.Throughout the 20th century, we stored and dumped toxic materials wherever it was cheap to stash them. In some cases, such as mines, we simply closed them, walked away and ignored the toxic mine waste. In 1976 we enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to regulate hazardous waste and in 1980 we passed Superfund to clean up the toxics already in the ground. Between the private sector, the military and the rest of the government, we have already spent nearly half a trillion dollars over the past thirty years to clean up the old mess, and the work will continue for generations. While EPA should have been more careful in its work in Colorado, managing and cleaning up this toxic mess will inevitably cause additional surprises. Even if we do nothing, we can expect that natural processes will cause other old mine waste sites to leak and contaminate valuable environmental resources. It may be convenient to blame all this on EPA, but it is unfair to do so.We need to develop the organizational capacity and technology required to investigate and remediate the toxic residue of our economic development. This will take resources. EPA in its current state does not inspire the confidence we need to invest resources in them to clean up this mess. Nevertheless, I see no practical alternative to our national environmental regulatory agency. This is a national problem requiring a national solution. Sadly, given Senator Inhofe's power and his intense mistrust of EPA, there is no chance that additional resources will be invested in EPA to address toxic cleanup.Unlike the climate issue that Inhofe famously asserts does not exist, yellow and poisoned rivers are a bit harder to wish away. Blaming the problem on EPA's competence is more posturing than policy. First, EPA did not dump the toxic wastes; they were simply trying to prevent them from being released into the environment. If we want them to do a better job, they must be given the resources and the authority to do a better job. If the argument is that they should do a better job with the resources they have, then at a minimum, Congress should commission a non-partisan, expert management analysis to see if it is really possible to \"do more with less\" in this instance.My guess is that they will discover what is obvious: that EPA's mission is expanding while its resources are shrinking. EPA's staff size peaked in Fiscal Year 1999 at 18,110. By fiscal 2014 it had shrunk to 15,408. Its budget in fiscal year 2015 was about $8.14 billion; a decline from $8.2 billion the year before, and these are actual (not inflation-corrected) dollars. Meanwhile, the complexity, size and toxicity of our economy is growing. While I am not arguing for throwing money at the problem, the Tea Party strategy of \"starving the government beast\" has not enhanced the competence of that \"beast\". I have some sympathy for the view that the federal government has become a huge, unmanageable, bureaucratic nightmare. I find city and local governments more focused, task-oriented and better managed than the feds. But the toxics of concern here may be located in very small jurisdictions that are unlikely to possess the expertise needed to identify them and clean them up. Moreover, the migration of toxics does not end at the borderlines of our towns or states. All of this argues for a federal program, perhaps one that requires a partnership between federal and state governments. I see little hope of progress, however, without additional resources.The central argument for sustainability management is that we do not preserve the environment because we love nature (although we might), but because we need it. Poisoned rivers are poor sources of drinking water. Here in America we continue our decades-long effort to clean up the legacy of our toxic past. While I wish we'd stopped generating this form of pollution, it is important to note that we have not yet ended some of the practices that got us into this mess. According to the National Wildlife Federation:The hard rock mining industry is the single largest source of toxic waste and one of the most destructive industries in the country. Today's industrial-strength mining involves the blasting, excavating, and crushing of many thousands of acres of land and the use of huge quantities of toxic chemicals such as cyanide and sulfuric acid. The mines that produce our gold, silver, copper, and uranium are notorious for polluting adjacent streams, lakes, and groundwater with toxic by-products.Moreover, outside the United States, in the developing world, we see the pattern being repeated. China, India, Latin America and Africa can provide countless examples of the same sloppy and mismanaged industrial practices that we practically invented here.There is no escaping these costs. It is truly a case of \"pay me now\" or \"pay me later.\" The short-term, expedient result of ignoring environmental impacts may be greater immediate profit for some, but the long-term impact is higher costs and lower profit, and many of those higher costs must be borne by all of us. Many of the companies that made the mess will be long gone before many of the bills come due. Even when the impact of toxic pollution is immediate, some of the costs to society are hidden in our rising health care bills.In the bad old days, some used to say that the solution to pollution is dilution. Given time, water and space, pollution will dissolve. Unfortunately, some of the chemicals we've unleashed are more persistent and dangerous than we thought. The answer is not to close down factories or end the use of these chemicals, but to more carefully manage their mining, use and disposal. Mining processes must be more closely regulated.Finally, a national effort to identify, manage and possibly clean up mining waste is needed. EPA has some authority under Superfund (CERCLA), but a decade and a half ago opted for primarily a partnership approach through EPA's National Hardrock Mining Framework. Moreover, as Julie Turkewitz reports in yesterday's New York Times, the abandoned mine issue is the subject of local controversy in Colorado:Some have argued that the mines should become a Superfund site... Others, fearful of the stigma that sometimes comes with Superfund status and leery of federal involvement in local issues, are opposed. The fault line in the debate often falls between newer arrivals, who tend to favor E.P.A. involvement, and longtime residents, who typically oppose it.EPA's credibility was not helped by the mistakes they made last week, but the local approach is obviously insufficient. The old strategy of letting sleeping dogs lie won't work because this mine waste is not going to lie still."}, {"title": "This Tiny Octopus Hunts In A Very Strange Way", "text": "This little octopus is challenging just about everything we thought we knew about the eight-legged creatures -- including the way they hunt, mate, and give birth.Take hunting. Whereas most octopuses pounce on their prey using all eight tentacles, new research shows that the larger Pacific striped octopus (LPSO) uses a single tentacle to tap its prey, scaring it right into its grasp--just have a look at the LPSO in this incredible new video (above). Yikes.\"I’ve never seen anything like it,\" Dr. Roy Caldwell, a marine biologist at the University of California, Berkeley and a member of the team that conducted the research, said in a written statement.And then there's the LPSO's odd mating behavior. Most other octopuses stay at arm's length while mating, because females tend to get aggressive--sometimes to the point that make a meal of the male.But LPSOs cozy up a little more, grasping each other sucker-to-sucker with their beaks touching as if kissing. And these kissing cephalopods even move in together in rock nooks and crannies, which others rarely do.After mating, the females lay their eggs and keep right on going. Females of other octopus species tend to die after a single brood.(Story continues below image.)Why are scientists only just finding all of this out? Well, it's not easy to study LPSOs, or octopuses in general.\"Many are small, live in dens or nooks and crannies in the reef, are nocturnal, are camouflaged... It is difficult to study a species that we can only collect once in a great while,\" Caldwell told The Huffington Post in an email.So while it seems like this little guy is different from every other octopus, we can't be positive yet.\"The fact is that most of what we know about octopus come from only a handful of large species.

She's the creator of Bee Free Honee, honey's plant-based twin. Made with apples and lemon juice, it has honey's same sweetness, slightly tart finish, golden glow and viscosity. It just doesn't come from bees.The bees, as Sanchez sees it, have more than enough to contend with -- their very survival. And ours. The bees would probably get along fine without us. They always have. They've been around for 50 million years. It's only within the past 15 years there have been serious signs of trouble. Bees have been dying off or abandoning their hives -- their homes -- in number. We don't yet have an answer, we just have a name for it -- Colony Collapse Disorder.Sanchez first started hearing about Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD in 1999, the same year her son Agustin was born -- prematurely -- weighing just over a pound. She worried about her son, she worried about the bees, she worried about the future for all of us. Bees are the key from everything from biodiversity to having enough to eat, or as Sanchez puts it, \"The essence of life is through pollinators.\"Trained as a pastry chef and based in Minnesota, Sanchez began talking to local bee keepers. Their hives were disappearing. But the way they were keeping bees was nothing like the holistic beekeeping practices she'd learned from her father. \"Nothing about the bee life is natural anymore. They clip the wings of the queen so she can't fly, can't leave. They have structured the bee world so it completely suits the human needs for that commodity of honey,\" says Sanchez. \"The bees are the treasures, not the honey.\"Farming practices have also changed -- for the most part, not for the better. Experts link CCD to GMOs, climate change, and most recently, the neonicotoids in pesticides. It may not be any one thing but a weird admixture of all of it, and it all stems from human interference.Identifying the problem is not the same as solving it. You can't just blame the government, and get mad and end there. We all have a role we need to partake in.\" For Sanchez, that means providing an alternative. Bee Free Honee is a happy accident, the result of an apple jelly recipe that didn't gel. It gelled Sanchez's hopes of saving the bees, though, by providing a sweet alternative. Yes, she's making and selling something, but protecting the bees -- and us -- \"is not separate from my business.\"Her work with Bee Free Honee has deepened her awareness of our food system, the role we play in it and its own role in our personal and global well-being. She's given up meat since starting the company and \"after my son was born, I became hyper-aware of nutrition. We're feeding the human body,\" she says. \"I don't take it lightly.\" \"Agustin is now 15 and the older brother to Emma, 11. He's autistic and faces certain challenges. We all do. We cannot live without the bees.Sanchez is not a bee keeper per se, she just wants to keep bees alive and pollinating -- for everyone's sake. \"I would only think of it as a failure if I didn't try.\"Pain d'Epices"}, {"title": "The American Lawn Is Now The Largest Single 'Crop' In The U.S.", "text": "Americans’ lawns now cover an area three times larger than any irrigated crop in the U.S.According to a new study from NASA scientists in collaboration with researchers in the Mountain West, there is now an estimated total of 163,812 square kilometers, or more than 63,000 square miles, of lawn in America — about the size of Texas. Here’s the map:The study was not about the growth of lawns, however. Instead, it focused on their impact on the environment and water resources. The researchers found that well manicured lawns can act as carbon sinks — meaning they would help mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.However, maintaining a well-manicured lawn uses up to 900 liters of water per person per day and reduces sequestration effectiveness by up to 35 percent by adding emissions from fertilization and the operation of mowing equipment.“If the entire turf surface was well watered following commonly recommended schedules there would. . . be an enormous pressure on the U.S. water resources, especially when considering that drinking water is usually sprinkled,” the researchers found. “At the time of this writing, in most regions outdoor water use already reaches 50-75 percent of the total residential use.”The study comes as Californians wrestle with how to care for their lawns in the midst of a four-year drought. Southern California’s water district has begun a “cash for grass” system that’s proven highly effective, with all $340 million initially set aside to convince homeowners to replace lawns with desert landscaping getting used up.And Los Angeles city officials have begun sending out complaints to the “top 1 percent of water users” urging them to change their watering habits.“It was a wake-up call,” Warren Dern, a Sherman Oaks resident with a 7,000-square-foot lawn, told the L.A. Times’ Matt Stevens in June. “I was like, ‘Wow, maybe we’re part of the problem.'”The NASA researchers did not address the drought in their paper, but did find that it will likely be some time before we see a significant decrease in lawn acreage.“Because of demographic growth and because more and more people are moving towards the warmer regions of the country the potential exists for the amount of water used for turf grasses to increase,” they write.And Euromonitor’s Ryan Tuttle has projected U.S. lawnmower growth is on track to recapture its pre-recession levels thanks to the housing recovery and what he said was a “continued emphasis on a well-manicured yard.”While the overall volume of mowers could come down moving forward thanks to younger adults’ preference for living in denser areas, as long as there are “older and better funded consumers” in the market sales will continue to be steady.Also on WorldPost:"}, {"title": "GPS Trackers In Fake Elephant Tusks Reveals Ivory’s Violent Path", "text": "When African elephants are killed for their tusks, where does the ivory go? According to a new -- and ingenious -- investigative report by National Geographic that followed the paths of two fake elephant tusks as they traveled through Africa, the answer to this question reveals a disturbing, violent truth about the illegal ivory trade.In a report entitled “How Killing Elephants Finances Terror In Africa,” reporter Bryan Christy explains how he used two sham (though extremely convincing) elephant tusks embedded with GPS trackers to follow an ivory smuggling route in central Africa.“These tusks … operate really like additional investigators, like members of our team and almost like a Robocop. We're going to send them into a part of the world where it's too dangerous for us to go,” Christy told NPR’s Fresh Air in a recent interview.By following the tusks, Christy says he’s found a blood-soaked, ivory-studded path right into the heart of Sudan, “which has no elephants left” but where their tusks are funding terrorist groups like the Janjaweed and Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army.This is a side of the ivory trade, Christy says, that is neither well-documented nor well-known.“East Africa is ground zero for much of the poaching,” he wrote in his report, adding:“Locals, including poor villagers and unpaid park rangers, are killing elephants for cash -- a risk they’re willing to take because even if they’re caught, the penalties are often negligible. But in central Africa, as I learned firsthand, something more sinister is driving the killing: Militias and terrorist groups funded in part by ivory are poaching elephants, often outside their home countries, and even hiding inside national parks. They’re looting communities, enslaving people, and killing park rangers who get in their way.”“In central Africa it's a war,” Christy told Fresh Air. “For me, this news story isn't about elephants, it's about violence.”According to an interactive map showing the fake tusks’ journey, Christy's bogus ivory traveled from the Central African Republic -- where it was planted in the black market in a small village -- into Sudan. On Day 19 of their journey, the tusks are said to have entered Kafia Kingi, a purported safe haven for the Lord's Resistance Army.“I interviewed a number of ex-soldiers with the Lord's Resistance Army, and they described hand-carrying ivory tusks on their shoulders 600 miles through incredibly dense jungle from Garamba National Park into the Central African Republic into ... a little area called the Kafia Kingi enclave, and there, they told me, is where Joseph Kony is today. And there, they told me, 'We trade the ivory with Sudanese armed forces. We are trading ivory with the military of Sudan, exchanging it for arms and medicine,'” Christy told Fresh Air.Marty Regan of the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations told Christy that “ivory operates as a savings account for Kony.”Kony, one of Africa’s most wanted terrorists, has evaded capture for years.He's been indicted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The United States and the African Union have both attempted to track him down.“For more than two decades, the Lord’s Resistance Army has murdered, raped and kidnapped tens of thousands of men, women and children in central Africa,” President Barack Obama wrote in a letter to Congress in 2011. “The L.R.A. continues to commit atrocities across the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan that have a disproportionate impact on regional security.”An estimated 36,000 African elephants are killed every year for their tusks.
