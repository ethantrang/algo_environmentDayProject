[{"title": "'Factory Of The Future' Opens On Chicago's South Side", "text": "This week Chicago's historic Pullman district saw its first new factory open in more than 30 years.But the 150,000-square-foot plant, where San Francisco-based Method Products will manufacture all of its popular nontoxic cleaning products, looks nothing like the steel mill that previously sat in the heart of the neighborhood.In contrast with the pollution-prone railcars that were once built there, Method’s new “South Side soap box” has its eye on a cleaner future. For one, it is the first plant making cleaning products — and one of only a small number of buildings in any U.S. industry — to earn LEED Platinum certification for its innovative design.The factory boasts a number of unusual features. Most visible from the outside is the giant, 230-foot wind turbine that generates 30 percent of the plant's energy. Three “solar trees” -- upright solar panels -- also help power the factory.Method's newly opened \"soap box\" on the South Side of Chicago.The facility’s roof is also energy-efficient, thanks to large skylights that let in light to the warehouse and distribution centers, reducing their need for electrical lighting. The roof forms the base of a 75,000-square-foot greenhouse operated by Gotham Greens, which is expected to produce 500 tons of fresh produce annually. The greenhouse helps insulate the facility, further reducing energy costs. Method has claimed it's the world’s largest rooftop farm.The plant has a goal of sending zero materials to the landfill and plans to recycle or compost any that don't make it into the end product: Method's popular cleaning supplies, sold at retailers such at Target and Walgreen's.“We think what we've created is the most sustainable manufacturing plant there is in our industry today, and we hope people will take it further,” Adam Lowry, co-founder of Method and a former climate scientist with the Carnegie Institution for Science Department of Global Ecology, told The Huffington Post.Inside Method's new Chicago plant.Lowry could just as easily have chosen a different route for his company’s flagship manufacturing site. But it was important to build the factory in an urban environment, he said: near rail lines so the company could transport fewer products by truck and closer to where an ever-increasing percentage of the world's population is living, allowing for shorter commutes.And Lowry is also confident that the factory's sustainability will ultimately benefit the company’s bottom line — even if that doesn't happen right away. The wind turbine, for example, cost $2 million to build, but Lowry said expects the investment to pay for itself in seven years. Relying so heavily on renewable energy also makes the company less susceptible to the price fluctuations more traditional energy sources.“Even if you take out the wonderful things socially, from the financial aspect, this still makes sense,” Lowry said. “We’re going to prove the business case for sustainable manufacturing.”The \"solar trees\" and wind turbine outside the Method factory.All the hype aside, sustainable manufacturing still faces challenges. Many companies don’t have the patience to wait seven years for a return on a multimillion-dollar wind turbine, said Michael Thurston, technical director of the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It’s also important, Thurston noted, for consumers to consider the big picture when it comes to sustainability. A LEED certification only speaks to a facility’s design, not its production process or the life cycle of the product itself.“You can look at little pieces of this in isolation and it may look good, but you have to look at the big picture to understand what the true impact is,” Thurston noted.“As a case study for how to put [sustainability] into practice, it seems to me they’ve kind of hit a home run on all three” pillars, said David Dornfeld, director of the Laboratory for Manufacturing and Sustainability at the University of California-Berkeley. He was referring to three aspects of sustainability: economic, environmental and social impact. Dornfeld sees other companies marketing their green initiatives — such as Levi’s water-conserving jeans collection — as being sustainable in a way that can only benefit them.“This is something that the smart companies who are looking a bit over the horizon are going to want to figure out,” Dornfeld said. “I can’t foresee any scenario where doing this could harm you if you look carefully at the technology you’re applying.”Bottles of Method cleaner move along the production line.A number of reports back up Dornfeld’s claim. According to a 2009 report from the MIT Sloan Management Review and the Boston Consulting Group, companies “acting aggressively on sustainability” found ways to cut costs, created new revenue streams and developed more innovative business models.And consumers prefer sustainability. A 2014 Nielsen analysis found that 55 percent of consumers across 60 countries said they were willing to pay more for products and services sold by “companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact,” though North American and European consumers were less likely to say so than consumers in other parts of the world.The Nielsen report also noted that millennials are especially responsive to sustainability actions, suggesting that consumers in the future will be even more interested.“So,” HuffPost asked Lowry one day after his plant’s grand opening,” is this the factory of the future?\"“I certainly hope so,\" he said."}, {"title": "California Drought: Will Governor Brown Stop the Biggest Water Abusers?", "text": "Co-authored by Adam ScowBy now, the whole nation is aware that its fruit and vegetable basket, California, is in the fourth year of an unprecedented drought. One NASA scientist recently projected that the state may only have roughly a year's supply of water left in its reserves. While that number is not entirely cut and dry (pardon the pun), it's clear that California's water crisis is real and that solutions are late in coming. For the first time in the Golden State's history, its governor, Jerry Brown, has placed mandatory water restrictions on residents and municipalities.We can all agree that individual water conservation - efficient toilets and washing machines, shorter showers and smarter landscaping - should be expanded and embedded in our culture. But restrictions on households are not enough to dig us out of our water woes. Given that residential and municipal uses account for about fifteen percent of California's annual water use, we must ask: who is guzzling California's water and what should Governor Brown do to rein in these users?Below we identify some of California's most egregious water abusers and offer some commonsense steps for Governor Brown's consideration.Big AgricultureThe Almond On the desert-like west side of the San Joaquin Valley, almond orchards stretch as far as the eye can see. But this nut empire is a relative newcomer to the neighborhood: in the past five years, skyrocketing global demand for the cash crop has enabled it to double in size and become the second-biggest water consuming crop in California. The arid climate and selenium-laced soils in this region make it a kind of madness to grow this thirsty crop here, where it takes more than double the water to grow almonds than in Northern California. Agribusiness giants like Beverly Hills-based billionaire Stewart Resnick are raking in profits from these crops, about seventy percent of which are exported overseas. The Westlands Water District, where many of these orchards are based, has pumped more than one-million acre feet of groundwater in the past two years - more water than Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco combined use in a whole year - to produce these nuts, threatening the region's water supply, and causing the ground to sink as much as a foot per year in some places. What's more, most of this crop is exported abroad--meaning, effectively, the water is exported along with it.Factory Farms Industrialized animal agriculture is notoriously water-intensive. For example, Food & Water Watch estimates that it takes 150 million gallons of water a day to maintain the dairy cows on California's mega-dairies. That calculation does not include the large quantities of water needed to raise the feed for dairy cows in California or to move manure into storage systems; it is just the water given to cows to drink and used to wash cows and buildings. A lack of available numbers tallying the meat industry's water use in California presents a problem as the State seeks to tackle the drought crisis.Alfalfa Of all crops grown in California, alfalfa uses the single largest share of agricultural water, so it clearly deserves attention. Like almonds, alfalfa is exported overseas, but is also used to feed dairy cows in California. Alfalfa is grown in some of the state's hottest and driest areas, including the Imperial Valley, and is exported to feed livestock. Interestingly, though, acreage devoted to growing alfalfa in California is expected to shrink 11 percent this year, according to Tom Philpott and Julia Lurie in this recent Mother Jones piece, as the agricultural industry increases production of cash crops like almonds and other \"pricey nuts.\"Big Oil It's estimated that each year, the oil industry in California uses eighty-two billion gallons of water - enough to supply both San Diego and San Francisco for a year. While agriculture dwarfs the oil industry in terms of overall water use in California - where more than one million people lack access to safe drinking water - it's well-documented that the industry's dirty practices like fracking, acidizing and cyclic steam injection are permanently contaminating and destroying water California can't afford to lose. What's more, recent reports have brought to light that this industry has been illegally injecting billions of gallons of its wastewater into protected drinking water aquifers.Bottled Water California is home to over 100 bottled water facilities that every year bottle millions of gallons of water for private profit. In Sacramento it is estimated that each year, the notorious multinational water hog, Nestlé, pumps around fifty million gallons of local groundwater to be bottled and sold for 1,000 times the cost of tap water. Nestlé pays just shy of $1.00 per 748 gallons of water it taps from Sacramento's municipal water supply, then resells it for thousands of times more in environmentally damaging plastic bottles. While Food & Water Watch has always opposed bottled water, during a historic drought the moral imperative for ending this practice is crystal clear.SolutionsAs he calls on California's 38 million residents to conserve, Governor Brown must also take bold action to rein in uses by these corporate water abusers. The Governor oversees the State Water Board, which is empowered under the California constitution to manage water for the public good. To serve that imperative, Governor Brown should quickly take the following first steps:1. Align California agricultural production with the realities of the State's water supply. The State routinely promises water users, including industrial agricultural users, five times more surface water than it can provide. The State must reduce demands to meet the reality of California's water supply.2. Manage groundwater as a public resource to prevent depletion. The State, albeit poorly, manages surface water for the public good, but groundwater - the State's water savings account for future generations - is largely managed privately. The State should start with immediate, sensible restrictions on groundwater pumping. In the long-term, the State should retire from production the toxic, arid lands on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley that we do not have the water to support and compensate producers fairly for their losses.3. Place an immediate moratorium on fracking and the bottling of California's water for private profit.It's Californians' job to exercise their democratic rights, starting with signing this petition urging the Governor to take these bold actions. While some have suggested that people boycott almonds or make other changes in their diet, the realities of the global food system are such that corporate agribusiness will continue to abuse our water and simply export the crops we wouldn't be buying. In other words, we can't shop our way out of the crisis.It's time for Jerry Brown to exercise courageous leadership that fixes the long-time mismanagement and corporate abuse of water that threatens the future of California's economy and agriculture. There are no easy shortcuts: the governor must govern.Wenonah Hauter is the Executive Director of Food & Water Watch, and Adam Scow is the organization's California Director.This post original appeared at Food & Water Watch's blog."}, {"title": "Scientists Issue Warning Over Chemicals Common In Carpets, Coats, Cookware", "text": "In 1961, a DuPont toxicologist warned colleagues that exposure to their company's increasingly popular Teflon chemicals enlarged the livers of rats and rabbits. Studies over the following decades found no safe level of exposure in animals and determined that humans, too, got sick when exposed to the chemicals -- which were also seen to build up in the body and resist breakdown in the environment.Nonstick, it turned out, tends to stick around.By the end of 2015, some of these most notorious polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs, will be fully phased out of use in the U.S. But emerging in their place, warn environmental health experts, are another group of PFASs that share many of the same concerning characteristics.\"We know these substitutes are equally persistent. They don't break down for geologic time,\" said Arlene Blum, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the executive director of the nonprofit Green Science Policy Institute.On Friday, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives published a document known as the Madrid Statement, signed by more than 200 scientists from 38 countries. The statement highlights the potential harm of both old and new PFAS chemicals. You may know them best as the stuff that protects your carpet from stains, keeps your food from sticking to packaging or pans, repels rain from your coat and prevents mascara from running down your cheeks. If you got a pastry with your coffee this morning, a PFAS substance probably even lined the waxy paper it was served on.\"It's a very serious decision to make chemicals that last that long, and putting them into consumer products with high levels of human exposure is a worrisome thing,\" said Blum, who was also the lead author on the statement.In an editorial accompanying the statement, Linda Birnbaum, head of the national toxicology program for the Department of Health and Human Services, and Philippe Grandjean, chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark, cite the common industry practice of replacing phased-out chemicals with structurally similar ones, such as the recent swap of bisphenol S for bisphenol A. Other experts have pinned this pattern -- what Blum has previously called \"toxic whack-a-mole\" -- on the nation's outdated toxic chemical legislation, which allows chemicals to remain innocent until proven guilty.\"Companies can currently produce other chemicals without a good idea of their impact on health and the environment,\" said Alex Stone, a senior chemist with the Washington State Department of Ecology, who signed the Madrid Statement.The scientists are calling for cooperation around the world to limit production of PFASs and to identify safer alternatives. Industry groups, meanwhile, continue to assert the safety of the newer versions of the chemicals. The replacements carry shorter chains of fluorinated carbon atoms, which experts generally agree lowers the chemicals' toxicity and helps the body excrete them faster.\"There is substantial scientific data supporting the conclusion that short-chain PFASs are not expected to pose a significant risk,\" wrote Jessica Bowman, executive director of the FluoroCouncil, an arm of the industry group American Chemistry Council, in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post.Bowman published a counterpoint column in Environmental Health Perspectives on Friday, emphasizing that the unique chemicals are \"essential\" to \"things we take for granted,\" including products that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in vehicles and coat surgical gowns with a shield against fluid-borne pathogens.\"We don't believe the Madrid statement reflects a true consideration of the available data on alternatives to long-chain [PFASs],\" she told HuffPost.Still, critics contend that not enough information exists to be sure the substitute chemicals are substantially safer than the older versions. \"Manufacturers said [long-chained PFASs] were fine for a number of decades,\" said Blum.The Madrid Statement cites data that links exposures to PFASs with certain cancers, delayed puberty, decreased fertility, reduced immune response in children and elevated cholesterol, among other health problems. A Danish study published in April adds to the concerns, linking blood levels of PFASs, including the new short-chain versions, with up to a sixteenfold increase in the risk of miscarriage.When HuffPost asked exactly when it became clear that long-chain PFASs previously used in Teflon and other products were \"hazardous to human health,\" Bowman said only that member companies had started working with the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators to phase them out \"a decade ago.\"A decade ago, in 2005, the EPA assessed a $16.5 million fine, its largest ever, to DuPont, saying the company had withheld decades of information concerning the hazardous health effects of PFASs. That's according to a helpful reminder from the nonprofit Environmental Working Group in a separate report also published on Friday. They note that internal documents revealed DuPont had long known the chemicals \"caused cancer, had poisoned drinking water in the mid-Ohio River Valley and polluted the blood of people and animals worldwide.\"\"Even when the EPA manages to punish a company, it's not big enough a deterrent. A couple years' more production easily eclipsed the amount of their fine,\" said Bill Walker, co-author of the group's report, which was accompanied by a consumer guide for avoiding potentially dangerous PFASs. The group recommends bypassing nonstick pans in favor of stainless steel or cast iron, for example, and popping corn the old-fashioned way -- on the stovetop.DuPont spokeswoman Janet Smith said in an email that the group's report contained \"a number of inaccurate and misleading comments.\" When asked to specify the inaccuracies, Smith told HuffPost that she was \"not able to discuss\" because of \"active litigation.\"Patagonia is among the companies currently phasing out use of long-chain PFASs. But rather than simply embracing their short-chain cousins, spokesman Adam Fetcher suggested that his company is \"working really hard to find an alternative\" to fluorinated chemicals. He highlighted Patagonia's recent investment in Beyond Surface Technologies, a Swiss startup that's developing plant-based replacement chemicals. \"We see a huge amount of potential,\" said Fetcher.Stone even pointed to the potential use of biomimicry to offer surface protection without the use of chemicals. \"Certain designs in leaves actually help water bead up and run off,\" he said.In the end, none of the alternatives may end up quite as effective as today's synthetics. But, as Blum noted, that might be good enough, at least in some cases.\"If you're going to climb Mount Everest, then maybe you need that degree of water repellency,\" said Blum, who was the first American woman to attempt to ascend the mountain. \"But do you need it to go to the beach?\""}, {"title": "Fixing The Climate Innovation Gap", "text": "The modern research university was conceived in 19th century Germany by Wilhelm von Humboldt to advance higher education from basic knowledge acquisition toward the higher ideal of knowledge generation. By combining teaching and research by placing students in labs alongside their professors, this new model fostered academic freedom and research innovation. It also provided a steady stream of young, creative, and motivated scientists. Universities worldwide quickly adopted this model and this built the brain trust that launched the industrial revolution.Most of the U.S. economic growth after World War II was developed through U.S. federal government investment in novel and innovative research in the science and engineering halls of major universities. This public-private partnership spawned the creation of entirely new industrial sectors -- biotech, semiconductor, Internet -- that are cornerstones of our modern economy.There is concern that this leadership, and the economic buoyancy it has provided, is in decline due to diminishing federal R&D support. A widening \"innovation gap\" has resulted from chronic and persistent underfunding of basic science and engineering research. Federal R&D support (as a percentage of GDP) has been declining over the last decade or more, and the U.S. is now near the bottom of all industrialized nations in terms of R&D funding growth.Just last week, House Republicans rolled out another flat budget for the National Science Foundation. Two important details of this proposed budget caught media attention. First, the science education budget was cut by $100 million, validating concerns that the U.S. is continuing what amounts to an intentional divestment of the next generation of scientists and engineers who would build the future economy.A surprising detail of this budget was a surgical 12 percent reduction for the Geosciences, the directorate that funds climate change research. This targeted slashing evidently fulfills a promise from committee chairman Lamar Smith (R, TX) to scrutinize and cut climate change funding. DOE budgets for environmental and renewable energy/efficiency research were also cut by 10 percent and a whopping 56 percent, respectively. While this budget has a long way to go before it is approved, its intent is crystal clear -- to defund and cripple climate science and energy solutions for our collective future.Risky BusinessClimate science has yet to turn anything resembling a profit, let alone develop a cure for cancer or invent the Internet. So how is the financial return on climate science in any way as deserving of support as science and engineering?The Risky Business Project, led by Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer, and Henry Paulson, conducted a regional analysis of potential US economic risks resulting from climate change. The most economically significant climate risks were found to be damage to coastal property and infrastructure, changes in agricultural production and energy demand, and the impact of warmer temperatures on labor productivity and public health. More than any other factor, the direct economic exposure to climate change is determined by where we do business. By focusing on regional risks, the study distilled a complex topic and brought it to the kitchen table. As noted by Mr. Paulson, \"Let me tell you! Here's what this is going to mean to you, your industry and your family. Suddenly people are interested.\"The mounting economic costs of climate change chip away at our economic growth and prosperity. We're presently on track to warm an additional 3°C by the end of this century and the related damages to coastal cities and infrastructure, agriculture, human health, and ecosystem services (such as air and water purification) are estimated to cost about one percent of U.S. GDP, or about $170 billion -- annually. The great wealth brought to us by science and technology will be diminished, even possibly erased, by the mounting costs of climate change, the \"social and economic cost of carbon\". The global economy and the global environment are on a collision course, as noted with exceptional clarity in Naomi Klein's new book \"This Changes Everything\".Climate science is our only way to develop a rational, physically based understanding of how, when, where, and why climate change will impact those things that matter to us most. It provides our roadmap for the future, detailing where the trouble spots and dead ends are, and also where opportunities lie.While the prospect of 3°C warming by the end of the century doesn't keep many people up at night, associated changes in our access to food, water, and shelter do capture our attention. Forty million Californians are affected by the exceptional four-year drought that now impacts 93 percent of the state. The drought cost over $2.2 billion in agricultural and related losses in 2014 alone, and profligate groundwater pumping has undercut resiliency. Texas lost $8 billion in agricultural damages alone in their 2011 drought. More frequent heat waves and drought elsewhere directly impact food security through stunted crop growth and reduced yields. Coastal cities and infrastructure are vulnerable to sea level rise, and ice sheets at both poles are melting at an accelerated rate. A new study by Carling Hay and others from Harvard showed that sea levels are now rising more than twice as fast as they were just a couple of decades ago. Last year saw the warmest global temperature ever in the 136 years we've been keeping records, and first three months of 2015 were the warmest ever recorded for each month.A Way ForwardBut such gloomy messaging is counterproductive and does little to advance progress toward viable, sustainable solutions. Indeed, it is fundamentally unethical to advance the view that life will become increasingly worse and insecure for the world's poorest. Instead, it's important to act upon this historic opportunity before us. As Buckminster Fuller famously observed, \"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete\". Thankfully, that change is happening.The good news is that the world is now adding more renewable energy capacity than coal, oil, and gas combined. This momentous transition quietly took place in 2013 and renewable power generation is projected to increase four-fold by 2030. The economic factors driving this are simple; the cost of electricity from wind and solar has plummeted and it is now on par or cheaper than conventional grid sources. The question is no longer if this energy shift will happen but rather how long it will take.But we still need our road map for the future - a science-based guide for understanding how climate change will impact those things that matter to us most: the security of our food, water and shelter. This is what climate scientists do and we're getting increasingly good at it. There are many questions we'll need to answer, and soon. How fast will sea levels rise and which coastal cities will be impacted first? How and when will water resources be impacted for specific regions? Will the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes change and if so, when? How will large agricultural regions and crop yields be impacted? How will ocean ecosystems and food resources change? How can we restore broken ecosystems - the engines of planetary sustainability? How weird is the climate of our present and near future relative to the preindustrial past?These questions can't be answered if climate scientists can't do their work. While I'm optimistic that the political tide is turning, I'm doubtful it will do so quickly enough. It's changing already: 83 percent of Americans understand that global warming will be a serious problem in the future based on a new New York Times-Stanford poll. Business gets it too: Last week, 43 CEOs of large international corporations representing $1.2 trillion in revenues issued an open letter calling for fast action on climate change.The great wealth generated from science and engineering innovation gets it as well. Venture philanthropy has been investing in research universities to mobilize scientists to solve targeted global problems, much in the same way that venture capital funds promising ideas. While private giving cannot and should not replace federal support, the truth is that federal support has been in decline for years and important work isn't being done. This most recent climate research budget slash has had a chilling effect on young researchers and it may, indeed, be successful in crippling climate science solutions unless the public, business and finance, and philanthropy step up to the plate.Investment in climate science research can equally serve as an engine for economic growth. Knowledge is power on a changing planet, and understanding the winning (and losing) opportunities gives business advance, actionable knowledge that improve both sides of the ledger. For example, investing in climate science research has been widely adopted in the $2 trillion reinsurance industry. A recent headline speaks volumes, \"No climate change deniers to be found in the reinsurance business\".Fixing the climate innovation gap is an urgent priority for us all. If we lose our ability to understand and predict the climate risks ahead, we risk losing the economic growth and prosperity that science itself has produced. This can be done with combinations of federal, industry, and foundational support, but it has to get done. Were Humboldt around today his likely response would be to accelerate research and mobilize scientists to develop the knowledge we need to make informed decisions about our collective future."}, {"title": "Top 5 Ways You Can Help Prevent Antibiotic Resistance", "text": "We hear stories in reaction to incurable 'superbug' bacterial infections like this story from Los Angeles and this one from Washington in the news constantly. The Obama administration has even released a five-year plan to combat the issue he calls \"one of the most pressing public health issues facing the world today.\"What can us citizens and consumers do to help prevent these incurable infections? First, we need to fully understand the issue:When bacteria are exposed to low levels of antibiotics, but not all killed, the remaining microbes have the potential to reproduce millions of bacteria which are well equipped to survive the antibiotics which they survived. This type of situation is more common than you would think, occurring in both our farming and health care systems. Most animals raised on modern factory farms are given a low level of antibiotics every day in their feed to keep them healthy in the midst of unsanitary living conditions. Similarly, many patients given antibiotics tend to not finish their prescription if their health improves quickly. Antibiotic resistance created from these sources contribute to making approximately 2,000,000 sick and lead to at least 23,000 deaths in the United States every year because of ineffective antibiotics.But you can help save future patients' lives with these 5 simple tricks:1.  Support restaurants and supermarkets that serve meat raised without antibiotics By learning where to buy meat raised without antibiotics, you can actively contribute to keeping businesses like these profitable and growing, while reducing the profitability of businesses which continue to operate by the status quo. When you buy from businesses that sell ethically raised meat, you show those companies that abuse antibiotics in raising animals that they must change their ways. By doing so, you can help contribute to phasing out the routine use of antibiotics and to curbing the threat of antibiotic resistance.2. Understand food labels Food packaging can be confusing and often misleading. Terms like \"natural\" and \"premium\" are unregulated by the FDA and therefore don't actually mean anything. Similarly, meat packaging will often emphasize that the product is \"100 percent antibiotic-free,\" indicating that there are no trace amounts of antibiotics in the meat itself. However, animals that yield meat labeled this way are typically still raised with the routine use of antibiotics and therefore still contribute to the public health threat of antibiotic resistance. Instead, look for meat labeled \"raised without antibiotics\" to ensure that you're buying meat that helps preserve antibiotics for medicinal uses. Also, it can be helpful to use USDA organic certification as an information shortcut since one of the many criteria for an organic meat product is that it is raised without the routine use of antibiotics.3. Get local If you want to create change, the adage goes, \"think globally and act locally.\" This could not be truer in the case of fighting antibiotic resistance. Some of the most effective ways for the average person to contribute to solving this global issue is to lobby for changes within local hospitals, schools, and other public services. For example, by influencing your local school board or town council to commit to serving school lunches and hospital cafeteria meals from sources that do not abuse antibiotics, an enormous amount of meals will contribute to preventing further antibiotic resistance from developing for years to come.4. Finish your prescriptions You can also help save antibiotics without changing the way you eat at all! Simply by finishing your entire prescription of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better only a few days of treatment in, you leave less infectious bacteria alive inside of you. By finishing your prescription, you ensure that even the strongest, most adept bacteria -- the ones able to survive the first few days of treatment -- are killed as well, thus preventing them from reproducing entire populations of similarly strong, adept microbes. Preventing the development of these populations is key in preserving the strength of antibiotics and in saving lives down the road.5. Take action Simply by educating your friends, family, and community about this issue and the ways they can help adds to the positive effects of all of these actions. Multiply the already significant impact an individual can make by following the first four steps by the number of friends and family they convince to do the same -- now serious change can be made. Also, consider supporting organizations that advocate for this issue, such as the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics, USPIRG, The Union of Concerned Scientists, The Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Natural Resources Defense Council to continue educating the public and organizing constituents to save antibiotics.Many have called for the Obama administration to take action against the abuse of antibiotics by the agriculture industry, but even with the recent release of a national action plan to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, not enough is being done to impact the operations of factory farms. Yet, this pressing public health issue can be effectively solved by the people themselves. By taking action and following these tips, you will be doing your part to save modern medicine."}, {"title": "Adorable Puppy Doesn't Understand His Hiccups", "text": "Everyone hates getting those pesky hiccups that won't go away, but no one hates it (or is cuter about it) than this little pup.Read more on TODAY"}, {"title": "#ClimateChangeIsReal, So Are Solutions (And Avengers)", "text": "Most people everywhere know in their heart of hearts that climate change is real. As the signs of danger grow, can we get our act together in time to stop this runaway train? Even I have had my doubts. But they were swept away by a flood of hope this week, as I watched a global conversation blossom: people everywhere have been proclaiming that #ClimateChangeIsReal -- and so is humankind's ability to solve it.This message is spreading like wildfire, mutating like a virus. Last time I checked the hashtag stats, it had reached more than 260 million people in English and Portuguese. We saw its potential a few weeks ago, when we first decided to encourage an ownerless campaign to flood the internet with the #ClimateChangeIsReal message on Earth Day. But we never expected it to spread with such speed and scale.As the campaign took off, many of the world's biggest public figures and companies threw caution to the wind and got involved -- from Barack Obama to Nike, from Hollywood Avengers to Indian Bollywood stars. It sparked a flood of creativity from artists, filmmakers, Internet meme-makers and social-media influencers like Smosh and the remarkable \"dogs of Instagram.\"This isn't about a few hippies holding hands or hugging trees now -- it's about building a better, happier and more prosperous world for all of us.This is a people's dream for the twenty-first century, and it's crossing over to the mainstream. As we saw across social media this week, people everywhere love sharing stories of solutions -- from Bangladeshi villages powered by the sun to Tesla Roadsters overtaking in the fast lane. Governments from China to the U.S. are taking bold action to cut pollution, while making families healthier and sowing the seeds of new industries and livelihoods.The world's biggest and most dynamic companies are increasingly at the forefront of this transition, because it makes sense. Unilever, whose products are used by two billion consumers globally, tweeted: \"#ClimateChangeIsReal. And businesses can grow by tackling it.\" Its CEO Paul Polman added, \"Climate change is already impacting our business. That's why Unilever is committed to 100% sustainable sourcing, zero net deforestation and moving to renewable energy.\"Companies like British communications giant BT and the world's largest furniture retailer IKEA proudly shared their commitments to 100% renewable energy -- not in the far-distant future, but here and now.Mark Ruffalo, currently breaking box-office records as the Hulk in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" added his voice on Facebook: \"#ClimateChangeIsReal -- and so is the possibility of 100% clean energy.\" Leonardo DiCaprio joined the chorus, while \"Vampire Diaries\" idol Ian Somerhalder tweeted: \"#ClimateChangeIsReal and so is our collective power.\"British celebrity Russell Brand and \"Avengers\" director Joss Whedon took the fight to climate deniers. Whedon tweeted wryly: \"Policy makers who deny basic scientific truth should also be denied penicillin, horseless carriages, air time on the magic box of shadows,\" then called out the farce of Republican Senator Jim Inhofe's snowball stunt.Whedon is right: while a handful of wealthy polluters and politicians are still trying to mislead us with fear, doubt and billion-dollar slush funds, they are starting to lose the battle. In country after country, even in the USA, the public consensus is catching up with the science. Countless #ClimateChangeIsReal memes circulated this week across social media and sites like FunnyOrDie, many of them poking fun at the deniers.The threat climate change poses to our way of life and everything we hold dear cuts through in the #ClimateChangeIsReal conversation, often through surprising new angles. One viral video, \"Skiing The California Drought,\" shows skiers slaloming down a vertical rock slope. Repeated again and again, images of dried-up reservoirs and riverbeds send a clarion call for action.Climate change is turning into a cultural litmus test, just like the civil rights struggles of the past. It's becoming culturally and politically unacceptable to deny climate change. And the solutions tent is bigger still: Tea Party Republicans are now campaigning for the freedom to generate their own solar power off-grid. The Pope himself issued an Earth Day message, and this week his envoy Cardinal Turkson took on fossil fuels at a Vatican summit of faith leaders.There is still a long road to December's Paris summit, and the bright future of 100% clean energy, a carbon-free world, rebounding ecosystems and flourishing new industries will take a generation more to build. But it feels like we're hitting a tipping point. This gathering swarm of unlikely allies is bigger than the \"Avengers\" -- and together, we could be even more powerful. You can feel the momentum, the zeitgeist, the rising tide of energy and opportunity.Barack Obama and scientist Bill Nye visited the Florida Everglades together on Earth Day. Both joined in the #ClimateChangeIsReal conversation (as did Hillary Clinton). Obama's final message of the day on Twitter was shared more widely than anything else he's said over the last year, because it captured that larger spirit of human achievement and possibility.Like him we can rise to this epic challenge by sharing solutions and taking simple, common-sense actions. Together, we can face up to the climate crisis and win. If we succeed, our children might just see us not as people who wasted what we were given, but as everyday heroes. So let's be the people they need us to be. Let's protect our way of life, build it to last, and share solutions to make it even better.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment. The series is putting a spotlight on initiatives and solutions that are actually making a difference -- whether in the battle against climate change, or tackling pollution or other environmental challenges.

At the ASPCA, we call it Cruelty Intervention Advocacy (CIA), a holistic intervention approach that takes into account how the societal challenges that pet owners often face -- including poverty, housing restrictions, lack of transportation, and limited resources -- profoundly affect the animals under their care.As we commemorate the fifth year of our CIA program, which started in New York City, I'd like to share why this uncommon approach is so necessary to keep animals alive.Typically -- and especially in the media -- we focus on homeless animals at shelters, in foster homes, or on the streets, concentrating our efforts on rescue and adoption. And that's certainly very important.But imagine starting much sooner, when pets are still in homes but on the verge of being relinquished to shelters or abandoned to the street because their owners don't have the financial, logistical, or other personal means to take care of them. In addition to becoming homeless, these animals can end up being hoarded, neglected, or abused.This is the moment when targeted interventions can make a big difference -- talking to people in underserved communities about their pets and the barriers they face, in order to connect them to support and resources.The next step can take many forms, including:This work is especially relevant in the midst of a sudden crisis such as a natural disaster or domestic violence. A 2014 collaboration of our CIA program and Urban Resource Institute's PALS (People and Animals Living Safely) program brought about New York City's first-ever initiative to shelter domestic violence victims with their pets, a critical service when you consider the extreme perils of domestic violence for both humans and animals.This owner-aware approach is also very beneficial to shelters. When more pets are kept with their families, more shelter space opens up for animals who need it most, and shelter staff can spend more time and energy adopting out each animal in their care.Our own successes help put these interventions in perspective. Since the CIA was formed in 2010, over 1,600 ASPCA financial grants have gone toward emergency veterinary care for low-income pet owners, nearly 2,000 animals have been spayed or neutered, and crucial services have been provided in over 200 hoarding cases.In June 2014, the CIA program expanded to Los Angeles, where our services have prevented over 1,600 pets from entering Los Angeles County shelters. In addition, hundreds of animals have been provided with vaccines at disaster preparedness events in low-income areas of New York City.One such beneficiary is Patty, who in 2014 moved with her husband, their two daughters, and their 5-year-old terrier Abby from Florida to New York City so Patty's husband could take a new job. But the position never materialized, leaving both Patty and her husband unemployed, with dwindling savings.The family ended up at a homeless shelter, and though they tried to sneak Abby in, her barking made it impossible for them to stay. Desperate, Patty put Abby in a crate in their car. A passerby noticed and called the NYPD, who retrieved Abby and took her to the ASPCA.This story could have ended with Abby going to a shelter and taking up precious cage space, as well as the shelter staff's time, energy, and resources. But in Abby's situation, the CIA team took over the case and met with the family. No citation was issued, and a foster home was found for Abby until the family could find longer-term housing. After several months, the family managed to find an apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and was reunited with Abby.It's remarkable that Patty was able to stay connected to Abby during the most challenging of situations, but we hope to make that outcome less remarkable over time. There's simply no safer place for an animal than in a home with responsible owners, and with the help of supporters, advocates, and humane leaders, we can provide pet owners with resources that will keep families intact and stop suffering well before it starts.Matthew Bershadker is President and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)."}, {"title": "Brother of Hillary Clinton's Top Campaign Aide Lobbied for Fracked Gas Export Terminal Co-Owned by Qatar", "text": "Cross-Posted from DeSmogBlogAnthony \"Tony\" Podesta began lobbying in late 2013 on behalf of a company co-owned by ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum aiming to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the global market. Tony is the brother of John Podesta, former top climate change adviser to President Barack Obama and current top campaign aide for Hillary Clinton's 2016 bid for president.Photo Credit: Wikimedia CommonsIn October 2012, Podesta Group began lobbying on behalf of the proposed ExxonMobil-Qatar Petroleum Golden Pass LNG facility in Sabine Pass, Texas, according to lobbying disclosure forms. The forms indicate that Tony Podesta himself, not just his staff, lobbied on behalf of the terminal beginning in quarter four of 2013.Tony Podesta's name also shows up on the Golden Pass LNG lobbying disclosure forms for quarters one, two, three and four for 2014. During those quarters, Podesta lobbied for proposed federal legislation aiming to expedite the regulatory process for permitting LNG terminals.Image Credit: Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of RepresentativesLobbying disclosure forms for the first quarter of 2015 show that Podesta Group no longer lobbies on behalf of Golden Pass.The company now employs FTI Consulting's Timothy Glassco to lobby for expedited permitting for LNG export terminals. Glassco, a former staffer for Obama's 2008 presidential run, recently departed after almost seven years on the job at Podesta Group, according to his LinkedIn profile.Glassco has lobbied for Golden Pass since the Podesta Group began lobbying for the company back in 2012, according to the federal lobbying disclosure database.Image Credit: Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of RepresentativesFTI Consulting may ring a bell for some since one of its employees, Chris Tucker, manages the fracking front group Energy in Depth.The Tony Podesta-Golden Pass example serves as an influence peddling and lobbying case study akin to many others unpacked in the DeSmogBlog-Republic Report November 2014 report titled, \"Natural Gas Exports: Washington's Revolving Door Fuels Climate Threat.\"Qatar, the Persian Gulf country which shares a border with Saudi Arabia, is the top exporter of LNG in the world. It has also come under fire for human rights abuses and for maintaining one of the most long-standing dictatorships on the planet.The Clinton Foundation, whose finances are currently under increased scrunity due to the looming release of the book \"Clinton Cash,\" took between $250,000-$500,000 from Qatar in 2014.Podesta Group's lobbying for expedited permitting for LNG export terminals paid dividends.During the same quarter Tony Podesta began lobbying for Golden Pass, President Obama hired John Podesta in December 2013 as his top counselor on climate change and energy issues.On March 19, 2014, National Journal reported that John Podesta attended a White House roundtable on methane emissions occuring during the hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\") process. At that meeting, John Podesta strongly critiqued the environmental movement for its activism against fracking.\"If you oppose all fossil fuels and you want to turn that switch off tomorrow, that is a completely impractical way of moving toward a clean-energy future,\" John Podesta told reporters at the roundtable. \"With all due respect to my friends in the environmental community, if they expect us to turn off the lights and go home, that's sort of an impractical suggestion.\"The harshly-worded John Podesta critique came a day after groups such as the Sierra Club, 350.org, Friends of the Earth, Food and Water Watch and others wrote a March 18 letter to the White House asking it to slow down the permitting process for LNG exports. He declined to comment on the LNG exports issue at the roundtable, according to Politico.John Podesta told DeSmogBlog that he was simply explaining the Obama Administration's policy when he made his remarks.\"My comments on natural gas reflect general Administration policy with respect to natural gas that was established before I joined the White House staff and continues subsequent to my departure,\" he said.Just two months later in May, DOE announced it would begin streamlining the permitting process for LNG export terminals with the highest chance of receiving a permit.White House meeting logs show that Tony Podesta met many times with the White House while lobbying for Golden Pass Products.On March 26, 2014, a week after John Podesta made his remarks about the environmental movement and fracking, Tony had a meeting with the White House. On April 4 and August 4, the logs show, Tony Podesta met with John Podesta in the White House.During his time spent lobbying for Golden Pass LNG, Tony Podesta had ten White House meetings, according to the logs.John Podesta denied any knowledge of the project proposal when asked about it by DeSmogBlog and did not comment on the content of the White House meetings with Tony. Tony also did not comment on the content of the meetings.\"I don't believe I have ever heard of the project you mentioned and have never taken any action on it or any other specific LNG project,\" John Podesta told DeSmogBlog.\"I had no knowledge that the Podesta Group represented Golden Pass, if indeed they did, and have certainly never discussed it with anyone associated with the Podesta Group, nor have I had any discussions with anyone from the Podesta Group concerning natural gas policy.\"Though he lobbied for Golden Pass for over a year according to the lobbying disclosure records, Tony Podesta told DeSmogBlog that he only ever held one meeting on the topic with a policymaker.\"I did one meeting in one senate office and the Senator was against our position,\" he said in an email. \"Never spoke to anyone in the executive branch.\"Asked why he registered as a lobbyist for Golden Pass for five straight quarters if he only had a single meeting with one Senate office's staff, he said, \"Thanks for pointing out. Filing amendments.\"Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen and an expert on lobbying disclosure law, told DeSmogBlog he finds Podesta's remarks hard to believe.\"If Podesta spent 15 months conducting lobbying activity on Golden Pass, but made only one lobbying contact on the issue in the entire period, that would be a very inefficient means of lobbying,\" said Holman.\"Fifteen months of lobbying activity with only a single lobbying contact, while technically possible, would seem wasteful at best, and more likely not what was really going on. In this particular case, if Podesta amends his report [in such a way as he described], the client might be quite surprised to see him declaring no lobbying activity to the public for which the client was billed each quarter.\"Glassco, White House officials, and Golden Pass LNG officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment from DeSmogBlog.Wenonah Hauter, director of the Food & Water Watch Fund, pointed to the longer arc of history of John Podesta and both the Clinton and Obama Administrations supporting shale gas production when she reviewed the results of DeSmogBlog's investigation.\"John Podesta has had a long history of touting natural gas, including when he was Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and more recently as an advisor to Obama on the 'all of the above' energy strategy,\" said Hauter.\"And during her tenure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton promoted fracking throughout the world [via the State Department's Global Shale Gas Initiative]. So, unless there is a huge grassroots movement among Clinton's base to reverse her position, she will continue to advance fracked natural gas as the solution to climate change.\""}, {"title": "Fracking New York: It's Not Over 'Till It's Over", "text": "When Governor Andrew Cuomo decided to ban fracking in New York State in December 2014, New Yorkers thought their worries were over.They were wrong.It was a great start, but too many people don't realize that the state is riddled with infrastructure that supports the fracking industry through the construction of pipelines, compressor stations, and storage facilities for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).Currently, there are approximately forty infrastructure projects in various stages of approval. Communities are beginning to grasp what this will mean to the health and safety of heavily populated localities, as well as New York's water supply sources, air, and wildlife.Highly volatile crude oil from the Bakken fields in North Dakota and Canada is being transported to the Port of Albany through New York State. The received oil is transferred into huge storage tanks before being loaded onto barges, which make daily trips down the Hudson River to refineries. Counties including Rockland, Orange, and Ulster are at risk for fires, spills, and even potential explosions.These undertakings are getting pushback from local New York communities. Included are:The proposal for Port Ambrose has received notoriety and resistance because it has the potential of being a terrorist target -- aside from putting the local environment and economy at risk. It is 27.1 nautical miles from the New York harbor entrance, and 16.1 nautical miles southeast of Jones Beach.Ironically, a wind project has been under consideration for the same area of ocean that would host the Port Ambrose Port. If constructed, it would become the largest offshore wind project in the United States.   When the public comment period for Port Ambrose was open, there were 62,000 responses registered in opposition. Both Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie have the option of vetoing its approval. The New York City Council has authored Resolution 549, requesting Cuomo to move forward on nixing Port Ambrose.How does infrastructure get approved? In New York, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) oversees this, and they are supposed to have first crack at issuing decisions. This includes designating a Section 401 Water Quality Certification (as per the Federal Clean Water Act), and air permits for compressor stations -- which emit high amounts of particulate matter, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide.All gas pipelines need to have federal approval. That is under the jurisdiction of FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission).Peter Nightingale, Professor of Physics at University of Rhode Island, explained by e-mail the science of why fracking infrastructure is so problematic. He wrote:To avoid irreparable harm to current and future generations, mankind must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent per year, as of today. This amounts to a 50 percent reduction over the next decade. This herculean task is at odds with a build-out of the fracked gas infrastructure, which commits us to about fifty years continued reliance on fossil fuels.Infrastructure accelerates climate change. \"Robust scientific research shows that fracked gas has a larger greenhouse gas footprint than do coal or oil, for any possible use. The reason is that the gas escapes at the well, during transport, and because of incomplete combustion,\" Nightingale noted.Nightingale addressed concerns about the Spectra pipeline. \"FERC approved siting of the 42-inch diameter, high-pressure pipeline next to the Indian Point nuclear facility in a seismic zone in Buchanan, New York, without satisfactorily addressing concerns raised by the local community and safety experts.\"Senators Schumer and Gillibrand have asked FERC to reconsider its approval decision. Residents of West Manhattan are none too pleased about the fracked gas pipeline either, for safety reasons including the question of how much radon is in the gas.In response to the viability of the Port Ambrose Project, Nightingale stated, \"We have roughly a decade to avoid climate chaos. Rather than investing in more fossil fuel infrastructure, we should focus on using energy more efficiently. The answer to cold weather is thermal insulation.\"Wes Gillingham, Program Director for Catskill Mountainkeeper, was clear in his appraisal of why New Yorkers need to be concerned. Via e-mail he elaborated:The scientific community is giving us a concise message to leave as much carbon and methane in the ground as possible, as we switch to different sources of energy. The oil and gas industries are using every tactic they can to dig us into a deeper toxic hole for the next fifty years. We need real solutions to deal with the crisis and have very little time to respond. We don't need new pipelines. We need a freeze on new fossil fuel projects now.This article originally appeared on Moms Clean Air Force.Tell the EPA to Protect Families from Fracking Pollution"}, {"title": "Birth Control and the Human-Wildlife Connection", "text": "I'd be lying if I said that much of my time isn't spent thinking about the connection between population -- that is, human population growth -- and every facet of life as we know it (who said insomnia was a bad thing?).There's the connection between population growth and poverty; population growth and food security; population growth and climate change; population growth and human rights; and the list goes on and on.But while each connection is unique in its own way, taken collectively, it all comes down to one thing: the impact we humans have on the earth and its inhabitants. Because without ecosystems and the wildlife that occupy them, our planet -- and everything on it, including us -- would likely cease to exist.Don't get me wrong: Population growth is not solely to blame for our environmental problems. But it does make many of them much worse -- deforestation, global warming, and overfishing are a few things that come to mind.Champions of fossil fuels and others have long tried to frame the debate as a choice between either helping humans or helping the environment. But they're shortsighted and wrong. Helping humans helps the environment.As it turns out, healthy and empowered people (and especially women) are key to sustainable development and conservation efforts. We can help to protect wildlife and conserve habitats by providing people with family planning services, and modern contraception in particular.And that's especially true for the almost 1.1 billion people who are currently living in the world's biodiversity \"hotspots\" -- 35 regions where the successful conservation of species would bring us that much closer to securing life on Earth.Most of these \"hotspots\" also happen to be low-income areas with a high unmet need for family planning -- where there are many women who want to prevent pregnancy but lack access to modern contraception -- and where, not coincidentally, there are high rates of population growth.One such \"hotspot\" is the Bwindi region in Uganda, home to almost half of the world's remaining mountain gorillas.While Bwindi's gorilla population resides in a national park, the growing human settlements surrounding the protected area -- a magnet for people seeking tourism-related jobs -- are a threat to the primates' wellbeing and delicate forest habitat.That's because more people means more human-gorilla interactions and, as a result, higher rates of disease transmission from humans to our primate relatives (with whom we share an astonishing 98 percent of our DNA). More people also means more poaching and increased pressure on the forests that gorillas call home.These are problems that had for years been severely ailing the gorillas in Bwindi, which has some of the highest poverty and fertility rates in the world. That is until wildlife veterinarian Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka set up family planning clinics via her organization Conservation Through Public Health (CTPH).Now CTPH's health and conservation teams in Bwindi reach as many as 22,000 people, 300 of whom (and counting) are new modern contraception users. Even more astounding is the impact the organization's efforts have had on the world's remaining mountain gorilla population, which has grown from 650 in the 1990s to now 880.The trailblazing vet's family planning initiative is just one of many programs around the world that are protecting wildlife and conserving habitats by providing local human populations -- and, specifically women -- with the tools and knowledge needed to take control of their reproductive lives. And, like CTPH, most of them depend on USAID for funding.That is why we must ensure that the government increases U.S. aid for international family planning programs to $1 billion. It's not just good for humans; it's good for the planet too.\"Everything is linked,\" Kalema-Zikusoka said earlier this month while speaking at Population Connection's annual advocacy event, Capitol Hill Days. \"It's about people having a better quality of life... because a good quality of life means good environmental conservation and good public health.\"I couldn't agree more."}, {"title": "Tesla Moves to Make Renewable Energy More Viable", "text": "*Photo Credit: Tesla EnergyImagine a world in which all our energy needs comes from clean, renewable sources. Every building could be covered and powered by solar panels. Transportation could be provided by electric vehicles. Clean and free electricity provided by sun and wind could be used in real time and stored in batteries for later use. Fossil fuels could be regulated to the fuel of last resort. It may not be the stuff of science fiction any longer. If Tesla CEO Elon Musk has his way, this is the future we are headed towards.Solar and wind energy have long been attractive renewable energy sources. Once the photovoltaic panels and wind turbines are manufactured, they can create many years of electricity with zero harmful emissions and little if any maintenance. In recent years the cost of solar has plummeted, leaving it on par with fossil fuels. The problem however has been in the less than constant ability of renewables to create electricity. Solar cannot produce as much electricity in inclement weather or any at night. Wind is intermittent. Also, unlike more conventional fossil fuel burning power plants, capacity cannot always be increased during peak periods of need.In order for solar and wind-generated power to be more than energy grid add-ons, they need to have a way to store their energy for use during off-peak or low production periods. Batteries are the best way to store energy during periods of peak production to be used later. However, no major company has offered an easily-scalable battery storage solution to meet these needs - until now. Tesla Motors, maker of the Model S supercar and soon to be launched Model X, announced its Powerwall home electricity storage solution under the Tesla Energy brand this week. There will be two available units of 7 kilowatt-hour and 10kwh capacity offered at $3,000 and $3,500 respectively. They can also be stacked for homeowners who wish to store more energy.So as not to leave commercial customers out in the dark, Tesla Energy will also offer the Powerpack. This 100 kwh unit is, according to Musk, \"infinitely scalable\" and can be clustered to meet any project size. Quiet pilot programs have been carried out over the last year with businesses such as Walmart. Tesla Energy claims that other large retailers have signed on as well. This would also make intermittently generated energy such as solar and wind more viable sources to provide reliable electricity 24 hours a day for municipal utilities. Conceivably, it could also be used in conjunction with existing fossil fuel burning power plants, allowing them to operate at a lower, but steadier, production level and storing their nighttime overcapacity for use during daytime peak periods. This could theoretically lower overall emissions from existing plants. If the same utility decided to add renewable power to its grid to meet increased demand at a later date, they could relocate that Tesla-provided energy storage to the new plant.To provide the batteries for these new products, and future electric vehicles, Tesla has already broken ground on their Gigafactory in Nevada. It is planned to begin production in 2017 and produce as much as 35 gigawatt-hours of electric storage capacity annually by 2020. To put that in perspective, one gigawatt is equivalent to one million kilowatts. Tesla has hinted that this may just one of several gigafactories in its future. It is also worth noting that one of Elon Musk's other companies is Solar City. Solar City claims to be America's largest solar provider with more than 6,000 employees. All these companies will work in concert to complement each other and bring clean energy to the masses.*Disclosure: The author is an alternative energy enthusiast who has no commercial or professional interest or relationship with any of the companies listed in this article."}, {"title": "Five Years After BP Spill, Gulf of Mexico Is Rekindling Responsibility for the Gulf's Future", "text": "A roseate spoonbill, a species native to the Gulf of Mexico, flaps its wings. (© Steven Blandin, Getty Images)By Mark Tercek and Robert BendickLast week marked both the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the 45th Earth Day. Earth Day began in 1970, arising out of Americans' frustrations with the degraded and declining state of the U.S. environment. Since then, there has been much environmental progress, but one need look no further than the Gulf of Mexico and the BP oil spill to see how much more must be done to pass along a safe and healthy world to our children.How can we accomplish lasting change? Over the past 45 years, the environmental movement has been organized and institutionalized. While that may have been necessary, we have lost part of the spirit of individual and collective responsibility for our environment that Earth Day was intended to celebrate. The response to the Gulf oil spill, however, is restoring that sense of ownership and setting an example for the rest of the country.When BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico five years ago, 11 workers died, and crude oil poured into the Gulf for 87 days. Citizens rallied, setting up booms to catch the oil and protect shorelines wherever they could. But as the oil reached the surface, spread into Gulf coast marshes and coated birds and marine life, they felt unable to affect the outcome.TNC staff and volunteers prepare a string of containment booms to protect an oyster-reef restoration project from the spread of oil on Alabama's Gulf Coast. (© Bill Finch)Today, more people in the Gulf region feel empowered because money resulting from the spill is being put into the hands of Gulf Coast communities. Those communities are embracing the opportunity to create a stronger Gulf by restoring the natural systems that support their livelihoods, fuel their economies and make their coastlines more resilient to rising seas, storms and other future disasters.One source of funding is BP's penalty payments from the now-settled criminal case against the company and other responsible parties. This money has gone to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), which is distributing the funds to Gulf states for coastal habitat restoration.Other funding is through the RESTORE Act, which Congress passed and the president signed into law in the wake of the spill. Under the RESTORE Act, 80 percent of potential penalties from the Clean Water Act will go to Gulf states and counties, and to on-the-ground federal agencies for post-spill restoration activities.RESTORE Act funds have come slowly because the Clean Water Act federal litigation remains unresolved. However, based on the success of the NFWF grants and the many good proposals submitted for RESTORE funding, putting Gulf restoration money into the hands of the people of the Gulf region -- who are acting through their government agencies -- appears to be a right strategy.Volunteers, TNC scientists and partners construct oyster reefs along Alabama's Mobile Bay on the Gulf Coast. (© 2011 Erika Nortemann)A recently released report by the Nature Conservancy (TNC) reveals that most of the funds already allocated for Gulf recovery are being spent to restore the Gulf's natural systems. And all five Gulf states are creating their own localized restoration plans tailored to the character of their coastlines.Mississippi, for example, is using NFWF funds to design a comprehensive coastal restoration strategy to repair coastal watersheds and make coastal communities safer from storms. Alabama is revising the Mobile Bay Estuary Plan, including recognition of TNC's living shoreline projects. Monroe County in Florida recently approved a project to restore the coral reefs in the Florida Keys, thus recognizing that environmental investments also have economic benefits.The majority of the state and federal agency projects emphasize restoration of the Gulf's estuaries and their tributaries, reflecting the science that the health of the Gulf as a whole depends on the health of the places where freshwater and saltwater mix. This estuary approach also breaks Gulf restoration into smaller pieces where individuals and local groups can have long-term influence on the direction of restoration activities in their home waters.Today, the people of the Gulf of Mexico region -- and those who represent them in government -- are not only repairing damage from the spill but taking on the responsibility to care for and create a stronger Gulf for the long term. Their actions serve as a model for how restoring nature can help strengthen coastal communities all over the world. This can be a renewed cause for celebration on Earth Days to come.A fishing boat and oil platform can be seen along Alabama's Gulf Coast.

Kerry even called for a grassroots movement to give world leaders \"the political will\" needed to respond to the climate crisis.But climate denial takes many forms. Even as President Obama rightly deplores global warming's threats to human well-being and our planet's web of life, his administration is opening up more public lands for dirty fossil fuel production and weakening international efforts to cut planet-warming pollution.President Obama pushed every country going to this year's Paris climate talks to propose a greenhouse gas reduction goal. But then the president himself announced a weak national plan that scientists say just won't reduce our pollution enough to help prevent catastrophic warming.Under the Obama national plan, America would still be spewing at least 5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution a year by 2025 -- far more than entire continent of Africa emits now. And to make matters worse, the plan is just a goal, not the enforceable commitment that we need.The U.S. and other developed countries must cut pollution much more to do their fair share in helping to avoid a climate catastrophe, according to calculations by a team of scientists.On the home front, the Obama administration has been moving quickly to turn more of our public lands and offshore coastal areas over to private companies for drilling, mining and fracking.Hundreds of thousands of acres of federal land have been leased for coal mining. Onshore oil production on public and tribal lands has increased more than 80 percent since 2008, according to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. Ninety percent of new wells on federal land are now fracked.The administration even allocated 810,000 acres of U.S. public land for oil shale and tar sands leasing in the Colorado River Basin -- a grave blow to the climate, since these are among the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive fuels on earth.  Our oceans are also fair game. Secretary Jewell recently pledged to open \"vast areas\" of the ocean to oil drilling. She has put Arctic drilling back on the table, backed oil exploration along the Atlantic coast, and is opening up tens of millions of acres in the Gulf of Mexico for new drilling and offshore fracking.Our planet pays the price. A recent report estimated that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuel leasing on federal lands and waters accounts for more than one-fifth of our nation's greenhouse gas emissions.This fossil-fuel frenzy just isn't compatible with climate protection -- or with the Obama administration's strong words on the risks of global warming.But there's also good news. The global movement for climate action called for by Secretary Kerry? That already exists.Four hundred thousand people marched through New York City last September ahead of the United Nations climate change meeting there. Hundreds of thousands more will protest at the upcoming talks in Paris.And that movement is calling on the Obama administration to support adequate, binding pollution cuts, to leave the majority of dirty fossil fuels in the ground, and compensate those already suffering the greatest loss from climate change.People around the world understand perfectly that climate disruption endangers our food supplies, our coastal cities and everything we hold dear. They want the White House to stop denying that much more ambitious action is needed to preserve a livable climate.Now it's time for President Obama and other leaders to listen -- and to act."}, {"title": "Oklahoma - First State to Choose a Federal Plan for Power Plant Carbon Pollution (Don't Worry, They'll be OK)", "text": "Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin issued an executive order yesterday prohibiting her state's environmental agency from even beginning to develop a state plan to limit power plants' carbon pollution.By refusing to write her own plan, Gov. Fallin becomes the first governor to take Sen. Mitch McConnell's \"just say no\" pledge. She also becomes the first governor to pass up the opportunity to tailor a plan to her own state's needs and opportunities, and the first to turn over implementation to the federal government.Power plants are the number one source of the carbon pollution that drives dangerous climate change. There are no national limits on that pollution now. The Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan, expected to be finalized this summer, will set state-by-state limits for power plants to cut back that pollution, giving each state the flexibility to tap the wide variety of cleaner resources in the way that best suits its circumstances.Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe is known for denouncing climate science as a hoax, and Oklahoma Attorney-General Scott Pruitt is known for his close ties to the fossil fuel industry. So it's not surprising that conservative Republican politicians in the Sooner State would rather say \"later\" to carbon pollution standards.Gov. Fallin is within her rights, of course, to leave implementation to the EPA. The Clean Air Act gives each state the first opportunity to craft a plan to meet federal pollution standards, but the state can refuse. If a state does not act, however, the duty falls to the EPA to write and implement regulations that apply directly to the state's power plants.Apart from Oklahoma, states aren't rushing to jump on the \"just say no\" bandwagon. Most states are actively engaging in the planning process, even before the final EPA standards come out. That's because most power companies and political leaders prefer to have their states in the lead, making the choices involved in writing implementation plans, rather than leaving it to the EPA.Where Gov. Fallin complains of \"unworkable barriers,\" a growing number of other governors see economic and job creation opportunities. Another Republican, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder issued a special message in March on \"Ensuring Affordable, Reliable, and Environmentally Protective Energy for Michigan's Future.\" He announced a bold vision for cutting energy waste, doubling renewable generation, and curbing emissions. Gov. Snyder said: \"We need to act now to make sure we have the tools to solve our own problems and keep decision-making in Michigan, not in Washington, D.C.\"But whether its plan is written by the governor or by the EPA, Oklahoma will be O.K. The state has enormous potential to cut its carbon pollution in ways that will help build Oklahoma's economy, create jobs, and save electricity customers money. The state ranks 9 in onshore wind power potential and 11 in solar power potential. (As the song says, the wind comes sweepin' down the plain.) Oklahoma also has yet to tap into energy efficiency, its cheapest energy resource - it ranked 36 in the country in utility efficiency programs in 2013, with annual power savings less than a fifth of the rate already achieved in states with more advanced programs. And, of course, the state has all that gas.So there's nothing earth-shaking here for state officials to be afraid of.There's no doubt that Attorney-General Pruitt will challenge the Clean Power Plan in the courts. He already jumped the gun, with 13 other state AGs, in a case argued two weeks ago before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. That case seems bound to fail, as the attack got little sympathy from a conservative three-judge panel. EPA's legal position will be strong when the standards are finalized this summer.If the state does nothing in the following year, then a federal plan will come into play.Perhaps for that reason, even Gov. Fallin has left herself an escape hatch. Her executive order allows the state to pick up the planning and implementation role again if doing so is deemed required by the state attorney-general or by the courts.Meanwhile, most states seem committed to stay engaged, and to keep Clean Power Plan implementation in their own hands."}, {"title": "Capturing Carbon: An Industrial Future?", "text": "Teesside Collective is a landmark project which is on track to revolutionise UK industry through carbon capture and storage (CCS) of emissions. But what actually is industrial CCS and how close are we to seeing low emissions from energy intensive industries?   Every Metropolis Came From Ironopolis  Teesside in the North East of England is heartland of UK industry. 'Ironopolis' the poem by Ian Horn illuminates the vital role which Teesside industry has played in the history of the world. Industrial exports from the Tees Valley span the world and have helped build the foundations of cities, landmarks and everyday commodities.   The region of industry accounts for 58% of the UK's chemical industry and the second largest blast furnace in Europe.   However, this industry has come at an environmental cost. When it comes to emissions Teesside is home to 5 of the UK's top CO2 emitting plants and Teesside industries are responsible for 5.6% of national industrial emissions. All of this gears Teesside to be an ideal place for industrial CCS.  I've grown up next to Teesside's heavy industry and a lot of my climate change work over the past decade has been based in the North East. I have found a good chunk of traditional industrialists in the region have been reluctant to embrace eco-friendly measures and they frequently point to the need for cheap fossil fuels to sustain industry.   Despite previous environmental-industry tensions CCS appears to be a miraculous solution as it's a solution which has got a broad spectrum of support from organic yogurt eating lefties to hardnosed industrialists. It offers a win-win situation to reduce emissions while maintaining industry.   Carbon Capture & StorageI checked in with Sarah Tennison, Low Carbon Manager at Tees Valley Unlimited (TVU) to find out more about this holy grail of carbon reduction technology. TVU, alongside BOC, GrowHow, Lotte Chemicals, SSI UK, NEPIC and National Grid, form Teesside Collective - which aims to reduce the region's industrial carbon emissions while attracting inward investment into Teesside.  CCS technology is capable of capturing and storing up to 90% of CO2 emissions produced by industrial facilities, which stops it from entering the atmosphere and contributing towards climate change. By compressing CO2 it can be transported and then stored in geological deposits, in the case of Teesside the prime site for storage is North Sea sandstone.   Sarah outlined the background of Teesside Collective and explained that the project is a cluster of leading industries with an ambition to establish the Tees Valley as a pioneering site by creating Europe's first CCS equipped industrial zone by the early 2020s.   Industrial CCS is recognised as an essential technology as virtually all heavy industries emit large amounts of carbon as a byproduct of their industrial processes and no amount of efficiency can substantially reduce emission output.    Is it too good to be true?Industrial scale CCS is proven and works very well on ammonia and hydrogen plants. While it's also been found to be a low cost technology - the sticking point for wide spread adoption however is who will pay for it.  Unlike CCS within the energy sector the cost of developing and installing the technology in an industrial setting cannot be passed onto the consumer via a green tariff.   Heavy industry exports are not sold directly to consumers but rather fed into an often complex supply chain. The financial value of de-carbonised supply chains has yet to adequately reach resources such as steel, chemicals and plastics so the argument made is that increasing export price would drive business overseas.   The challenge therefore to the success of industrial CCS on Teesside and indeed anywhere is a matter of finance.   Making the business case for industrial CCS is half of this battle and many companies are keen to adopt emission savings as a competitive advantage. While it's a cost-effective form of carbon reduction, industrial CCS still needs major political and financial support.   The role of industrial CCS has generally been neglected when dealing with the topic of climate change yet it is one which must be confronted.   Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North acknowledged the critical threat tackling climate change in the region;   \"The Tees Valley's successful process industry cluster is central to the region's position at the centre of the UK's move towards a high value, low carbon economy, attracting significant investment over recent years and developing a reputation for green excellence.  \"Indeed, our process industries are playing a crucial role in the transition towards a green economy. Not only are products such as lightweight plastics, insulation, and components for wind turbines manufactured on our doorstep, but key energy intensive industries such as GrowHow have reduced carbon emissions associated with their main fertiliser product by 40 per cent since 2010.\"  CCS is an essential part of the picture if we are to meet climate targets of limiting warming to less than 2 degrees. The Teesside Collective project is expected to be represented at the UNFCCC meeting in Paris later this year, where it will hopefully make the business case for support and incentivise national funding.   Sarah stated: \"Teesside Collective is a solution to a problem. ICCS in Teesside could be capturing an initial 5 million tonnes of CO2/year by the early 2020s, in line with the Committee on Climate Change's recommendation for widespread deployment of CCS on industry as part of cutting UK emissions by 80% by 2050Industrial CCS in Teesside supports the UK economy - strengthening our manufacturing base and growing export markets - while helping to meet our carbon targets. It's not just a benefit for Teesside, it's a benefit for the whole of the UK.\"Photos: Via Via"}, {"title": "Connecting the Dots Between Green Beauty and Mother Earth: Tips From Rona Berg", "text": "In April, people around the world celebrate Earth Day. This day was created in 1970 by Senator Gaylord Nelson, and it is a great time to celebrate and appreciate one's connection to the environment.Some people use this time to plant trees and attend events about sustainable practices. Earth Day brings awareness to a social, political and economic movement that affects us all on a daily basis (even if we don't think it does). What happens after Earth Day, with your daily individual practices, is what the collective movement is all about. We need to all move forward thinking about how our small daily habits have huge effects on Mother Earth.Most of us know about going green with our foods and eating organic, which has positive effects on our bodies, and helps protect the earth. But what about the products you actually put on your body?The term \"green beauty\" is not only about what the ingredients your personal care products do to you, it's also about the effects it has on the environment (before and after you use them). The truly green consumer should also be conscious about how the farmers that grow those ingredients are treated and paid.According to a survey done on 2,300 people by Environmental Working Group (EWG), the average person uses nine products daily. This becomes over 10,000 unique ingredients that go back into the earth. How are we, on a day-to-day basis, connecting the dots?I had the chance to speak with Rona Berg, editor-in-chief of Organic Spa Magazine. Rona is also a best-selling author, and chairs the Personal Care Committee of the non-profit Green Spa Network, where she advises personal-care brands and spas on how to become greener and more sustainable.Karim Orange: Green Beauty has become a huge trend, but I think sometimes how it connects to environmental issues is sometimes missed. Can you please explain how the average person should connect the dots in their thinking and practices?Rona Berg:When you use your cleanser at night, or wash the bathroom sink with your household cleaning products, ask yourself, what is it that is washing down the drain? Where does it go? When it absorbs into our rivers, our soil, our lakes and our oceans, how does it impact our health and the health of the environment?When we throw our plastic bags and packaging away, where is \"away\"? In fact, there is a trash vortex bigger than the state of Texas in the Pacific Ocean, and one in the Atlantic, too, where those plastic bags swirl, polluting the waters and choking birds and turtles, and, because they are not biodegradable, they never go away.K.O: We often see and hear the term 'Fair Trade' is this a label we should look for in beauty products? What should we be asking ourselves about the products we purchase pertaining to their individual social responsibility to the Earth? What certifications truly encompass this?R.B: Many companies -- and consumers -- are now spotlighting the back story, or the provenance of their goods and purchases. For example, where do they come from? How were they made? Were the workers fairly compensated? Were they made by a nine-year-old in a sweatshop in South Asia? This kind of awareness is so important, because whatever we buy we ultimately buy into, and support with our dollars.Fair Trade USA (fairtradeusa.org) is a nonprofit that helps farmers across the globe build sustainable business. It also audits and certifies that Fair Trade products were made under fair and equitable conditions. B Corporation (bcorporation.net) is another great organization that certifies businesses that agree to hold to a high standard of transparency and accountability.There are many fine, ethical businesses that do not certify, but these certifications are a way of letting consumers know that a business may share the same values that they do.K.O: You have been the 'go-to' person in the green beauty industry before the trend. How did this evolve from your days at Elle and The New York Times? Is this something you grew up practicing?R.B: Back then, natural and organic beauty products were thin, runny, beige and not the most appealing, on an efficacy or sensory level. But now, thanks to consumer demand, the market has come up so far, and there are many brands with gorgeous formulations in beautiful packaging, and they really work, without the ingredients in traditional products that our own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cites as potentially harmful. So the question really becomes, why wouldn't you use them?K.O: Any advice for women who have decided they want to go in the green beauty direction?R.B You don't need to throw everything away at once. Phase in new products slowly. Prioritize. For example, it is more important to go green with a moisturizer or foundation that sits on your face all day, than a cleanser, which washes right off.Find resources that you can trust. Educate yourself about potentially harmful ingredients, and ones that may be sensitizing to your skin. You don't need to be a cosmetic chemist to learn the basics on how to read ingredient labels and try to avoid the pore-clogging petrochemicals and artificial colors (FD&C or D&C colors) that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists as human respiratory toxins. Like a food label, a beauty-product ingredient label is top-loaded: the first half indicates the ingredients present at a higher percentage.Sample green products and enjoy discovering new brands that you know will not only enhance your beauty on the outside, but are also good for you on the inside. Believe me, once you go green, you never go back!You can follow Rona on Twitter@RonaBerg for daily tips on green living.In conclusion I hope that everyone enjoyed Earth Day 2015. This year's slogan was 'It's our turn to lead.' Leading is a daily practice that can only be done when we raise our conscience to that of the collective.Next up as part of my green awareness series Rohan Marley talks sustainable coffee manufacturing and Rastafari."}, {"title": "The Exelon-Pepco Merger & Exelon's History of Anti-Clean Energy Lobbying", "text": "Exelon has a long history of using political influence to oppose the deployment of renewable energy. Exelon’s political operations may impact the company’s ability to show that a merger with Pepco would provide a tangible benefit to customers on the criteria of conserving natural resources and preserving environmental quality - two factors that must be considered in the District of Columbia. According to the Office of the People’s Counsel, “the [Exelon-Pepco] merger is not in the public interest…as a result of Exelon’s longstanding resistance to policies promoting renewable energy.”If approved, the Exelon-Pepco merger would empower the company to continue its anti-renewable campaign in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, negatively impact ratepayers, and hinder the growth of the renewable energy industry.Exelon has routinely worked against renewable energy policies and used its financial resources and political influence to benefit the company at the expense of environmental quality and renewables. Most recently, Exelon has proposed a bill in Illinois, the Low Carbon Portfolio Standard (LCPS), that would subsidize nuclear plants that are struggling to compete with the cheap cost of electricity from natural gas plants and wind turbines. As written, the LCPS would increase rates for ratepayers, and Exelon’s nuclear plants would earn an estimated $300 million per year from low carbon credits while renewables would get almost nothing. Crain’s Chicago Business Journal documented that “Exelon long has complained that profits at its six nuclear power plants in Illinois are under pressure in part due to competition from tax-subsidized wind farms. Exelon is backing state legislation that would create a new surcharge on most electric bills throughout the state that would funnel as much as $300 million a year to the company's Illinois nukes.”In the past, Exelon opposed fixing the Illinois’ renewable energy law (RPS) despite the fact that the fix could save ratepayers up to $280 million between 2014 and 2017. Flaws in the RPS have plagued the law and resulted in millions of dollars, intended to incentivize clean energy projects, remaining stuck at the Illinois Power Agency. Yet, an Exelon spokesperson claimed, “The law is working as intended…”Exelon has also made clear that the company’s position is to actively work to limit distributed solar energy resources through demand charges and other political mechanisms. In a recent news release, Exelon said, “To ensure the equitable sharing of grid costs, utilities would recover residential delivery costs through a combination of charges, including a demand charge…” In other words, Exelon is hoping to charge customers who install distributed rooftop solar.Independent studies show that distributed rooftop solar benefits all ratepayers, and is not subsidized by non-solar customers as Exelon and other utilities claim. Recent reports commissioned by regulators in Mississippi, Nevada, and Maine, and the state consumer advocate in Vermont show that distributed solar produces benefits for all ratepayers.Despite these facts, Exelon appears to be echoing talking points that have been used by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the utility trade association. EEI was recently exposed in the Washington Post for launching a plan to attack rooftop solar because the competition threatens the traditional utility business model. Exelon sent $3.4 million to EEI in 2012 and in the latest disclosure for January through June 2013, Exelon spent $3.8 million in payments to EEI.Furthermore, Exelon joined forces with fossil fuel connected groups to attack clean energy and protect its financial interests, despite the negative impacts their actions could have on ratepayers and the renewable energy industry.Exelon teamed up with the American Energy Alliance (AEA), which is affiliated with the Institute for Energy Research (a group that receives funding from fossil fuel interests and is led by Thomas Pyle, a former Koch Industries lobbyist), to attack the wind production tax credit. Exelon sent $290,000 in 2012 and $236,000 in the first half of 2013 to AEA, according to the latest disclosures of Exelon’s political spending. AEA and Exelon communicated “in weekly emails about how best to fight another extension of the [wind production] tax credit.”In addition, Exelon hired The Nickles Group (run by former Senator Don Nickles) to lobby against the wind Production Tax Credit (PTC). Koch Companies Public Sector (a subsidiary of Koch Industries) also hired The Nickles Group in June 2014. Days after the Koch Industries hired The Nickles Group, Former Senator Nickels placed a Letter to the Editor in the New York Times calling for the end of “federal subsidies for renewables like the wind production tax credit.” Koch Industries directly competes with renewable energy like wind due to its investments in coal and natural gas industries and has backed front groups and lobbyists attacking pro-renewable energy policies.Finally, Exelon’s subsidiary in Illinois, Commonwealth Edison, funded the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and was a sponsor at ALEC’s 40th Annual Meeting in Chicago in 2013. ALEC’s Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force, whose members include fossil fuel and utility interests, has produced model legislation attacking state level clean energy laws and solar net metering policies and distributed those model bills to legislators across the country.Exelon’s history of anti-renewable energy campaigning makes it difficult to argue that the Exelon-Pepco merger would conserve natural resources and preserve environmental quality. The District of Columbia’s renewable portfolio standard and other pro-clean energy policies could conflict with Exelon’s financial interests. As the records show, Exelon does not hesitate to fund front groups and aggressive political lobbying to advocate for its interests and eliminate pro-clean energy policies when those policies conflict with Exelon’s bottom line. With the cost of clean energy plummeting, we should be encouraging pro-renewable energy policies, not subsidizing expensive nuclear power to benefit Exelon at the expense of ratepayers."}, {"title": "Pet Store Secretly Replaces All The Animals With Rescues, Shoppers Fall In Love", "text": "Animal shelters in Brazil are underfunded and overcrowded, and many families automatically bypass shelter pets — choosing to purchase a pricey puppy rather than adopt a free rescue.Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "Sustainability: A Matter of Soul", "text": "Photo: I. RimanoczyAs a faculty member of the W. Huizenga Business School, I was recently invited to contribute to a paper edited by Prof. Frank Cavico about orientation for new graduate students. Based on his experience in orientation sessions, he had identified areas that were important to address when welcoming the new future leaders. These included ethics, leadership, social responsibility, legal aspects of business practices, and sustainability.It is important, when starting an article or a presentation, to define the terms, so as to build a common language. But with Sustainability there are many different understandings and definitions - so many that it can become confusing. Is Sustainability a goal or a discipline? Is it the same as Corporate Social Responsibility? By CSR do we mean philanthropy? Is it about environmental practices? What about the social impact of our behaviors? Or is it about climate-- climate change, climate impact on business and society? Adding to the confusion is the fact that in any of these definitions or perspectives, one can find polarized interpretations:Climate change is man made. No, it's natural.It is a corporation's responsibility to care for social aspects and to give back to the community. Not at all -it should be up to the individuals to engage in community actions or giving, while the corporation has a responsibility to shareholders.Governments need to intervene with better regulations and should place a tax on carbon emissions. Not at all: we have to let the market regulate behaviors.And there is even a third interpretation, which holds that sustainability refers to the importance of, and need for, the organization remaining in business - and this requires to act in a sustainable way!But what doesn't change, while we are debating and advocating for our preferred position, is that we have to face the consequences of climate events, be they droughts, flooding, hurricanes, salt water intrusion into the city's freshwater system, earthquakes and their impact on our life. We have to navigate socially violent times, as former Jesuit and peace activist John Dear observes in his book The Nonviolent Life. As humans, we have to cope with a lot that is new all while trying to maintain a 'life as usual' approach.So what to convey to incoming students about sustainability? Is it a legal requirement, a moral issue, a strategic approach, an ethical requirement, a social duty, a convenient competitive advantage for a corporation? Or perhaps even is it something that is simply 'the right thing\" for their future and their children's?When Alan Rusbridger, Editor in Chief of The Guardian newspaper, announced in December 2014 that he was leaving his position in Summer 2015, he made a public commitment, to take the months he had left in his current position as a unique opportunity to stand up for climate change, by personally launching an awareness and action campaign to promote divesting from fossil fuels. As a man deeply involved in the daily news, he wondered if there was anything he could do, with all he knew about the seriousness of our planetary emergency. This is not different from the reports in recent studies about business leaders who described their motivations to champion sustainability. At some point they found that they had available sufficient information and had connected the dots - they saw a fuller picture of what was happening, and immediately asked themselves, How am I contributing to these problems? What could I do?Interestingly, as a researcher, I have had a similar experience. The more I learned about the dire state of our planet, in social and ecological terms, the more grief and despair I experienced, the stronger I felt the need to do something about it.It seems that when the awareness touches the heart, the motivation to act is unstoppable. This is an interesting cycle that repeats itself: we are exposed to information, at some point it becomes personal as we connect emotionally with the information - it's not just washing over us. The head connects with the heart, and the anxiety kicks in: I have to do something, I cannot NOT do something.It is curious that despite this repeated sequence, we tend to fall back to a position where we seek to make the 'business case' so as to convince others; we want to find data to show the impact on the corporation's image, on employee retention, on market share, cost savings, efficiency, and bottom line...I certainly agree that the visible benefits need to be showcased, but when it comes to motivating others to join the sustainability movement, the rationale is interestingly not the most powerful factor. In fact, it's the inspiration, the vision of a better future, the sense of a personal purpose, the need to make a difference, the desire to find life's meaning and our personal role in shaping a better world.So perhaps the core of sustainability is spiritual, and we have a chance to reach the next step of human evolution. It's worth the try.Keywords: sustainability, ethics, leadership, CSR, social responsibility, climate change, tax carbon, markets, non violence, peace, The Guardian, spiritual"}, {"title": "Ten Ways Those Who Want to Give Your Land Away are Misleading You", "text": "It is hard to imagine that anyone would believe the fallacies peddled by the American Lands Council trying to convince politicians to give away our public lands, but eleven Western state legislatures spent time in the 2015 session entertaining these misguided ideas. These fallacies try to justify robbing the federal treasury and your national heritage by giving away our national lands to the states to be sold off. Now Representative Rob Bishop of Utah is creating a national study group to explore this widely unpopular idea. Below are the American Land Council's ten most frequently cited fallacies and the real facts you should know.Fallacy 1: Westerners think there is too much national land, it is holding back economic growth, and the states could do a better job of managing it.Fact: The Western economy has outperformed the rest of the U.S. in terms of growth in employment, population, and personal income during the last four decades in part due to the popularity of national lands. As far as there being too much public lands, a new study shows that on a per resident basis, Western states have more land under private, state and local ownership than many Eastern states. In a recent poll of Westerners, the majority of people across most of the political and ideological spectrum oppose the idea of transferring national lands to the states. The states of Utah, Idaho and Nevada recently studied the costs associated with taking over national lands and all three studies showed that only under very extreme assumptions, and without accounting for the hundreds of millions of dollars to fight wild fires, it might be possible for the states not to lose money. Most of the scenarios studied showed the states losing money, meaning they would need to raise taxes and sell off lands to maintain balanced budgets.Fallacy 2: The Equal Footing Doctrine means the national lands in the West actually belong to the states not to all Americans.Fact: Proponents of transferring public lands to the states often refer to the Equal Footing Doctrine as evidence that the Western states have been treated unequally compared to the original thirteen states. The Equal Footing Doctrine holds that all states are admitted to the Union with the same political rights and attributes of sovereignty as the original thirteen states. It does not mean that physical or economic situations among states must be the same. Regarding land sovereignty, the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently found the doctrine only applies to submerged lands (lands below high tide lines and the beds and banks of navigable waters).Fallacy 3: The Enclave Clause of the U.S. Constitution means that the U.S. can only own lands for forts and military purposes.Fact: This argument has repeatedly been rejected by the courts including the U.S. Supreme Court which has recognized that the U.S. can both acquire and own property in any state for a wide variety of purposes. The Enclave Clause simply establishes the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. over property acquired under it.  Fallacy 4: State Enabling Acts have been misinterpreted all these years and they actually require the transfer of national lands to the states.Fact: Enabling Acts lay out the terms and conditions under which a new state joined the Union and they were agreed to by each state and Congress. The Enabling Acts for most Western states contain similar language affirming that the state agrees that they \"forever disclaim all right and title\" to the public lands within the state. Proponents of land transfers claim that state Enabling Acts require the federal government to extinguish its rights to national lands. They are, however, relying on legal interpretations that ignore congressional intent and wrongly interpret legal and historical precedent.Fallacy 5: Even if the federal government does own the national lands, there is a legal obligation to sell them all and share the proceeds with the states.Fact: Some argue that Western states expected all national lands to be quickly sold into private ownership. History shows, however, that Congress began retaining significant national lands before many Western states even negotiated entering the Union. In Montana 5.8 million acres were put into national forest reserves while it was still a territory. Arizona entered the Union with over 14 million acres within its boundaries reserved for national purposes. Claims that the states had expectations that all public lands within their boundaries would be sold belie the historical reality of the time.Fallacy 6: It wasn't until 1976, when the Federal Land Policy and Management Act was passed that Congress decided to keep lands in national ownership which reneges on a 200-year-old obligation that Congress has to sell off our national lands.Fact: As early as 1832 Congress began retaining nationally significant lands with national parks and national forests soon amounting to tens of millions of acres. In 1934 Congress passed the Taylor Grazing Act reserving about 80 million acres within grazing districts across the West. Similar to reserves for the National Forests these lands were identified as having national value and would no longer be routinely open for sale and disposal.Fallacy 7:  Illinois, Missouri and several other states successfully compelled Congress to transfer title of national lands and this is a precedent that can be used today to compel Congress to transfer national lands to the states.Fact: Around 1830 five states protested federal land ownership, not in court, but by petitioning Congress arguing that it lacked the power to manage lands within a state after statehood. However, these petitions were unsuccessful and did not force Congress to transfer title to these lands to the states. It was not capitulation by Congress that led to eventual land sales in these states, it was the development of land surveys and homesteading laws.Fallacy 8: The 19th century public lands policies of Andrew Jackson should still hold today.Fact: Land transfer proponents are fond of referring to President Andrew Jackson's 1833 message to the Senate laying out his support for land disposal. But to claim that the land policies of 1833 should remain the land policies of the 21st century is akin to saying public policy should never change. President Jackson also signed the Indian Removal Act leading to the forced resettlement of tens of thousands of American Indians to make way for white settlers but that doesn't mean American Indian land policies today should remain as they were in the 1830s.Fallacy 9: Because the U.S. conveyed federal lands to Hawaii when it became a state in 1959, the U.S. should now convey all nationally owned lands to all of the other states.Fact: Each state negotiated the individual terms of their admission to the Union and while there are many similarities between states, there are also many differences based on the date the state entered the Union and the geography of the state. The transfer of federal lands to the Hawaii (minus two National Parks and military installations that were established prior to statehood) was not unlike the grants of millions of acres of lands to the other Western states. The federal government is still the second largest landowner in the State of Hawaii.Fallacy 10: It is simply unfair that there is so much national land in the Western states compared to the states in the East and this injustice should be fixed.Fact: Land was sold to pioneers in the East because early homesteading laws focused on selling land that could be used for agriculture and family farms. Eastern lands had rich soil and benefited from ample rainfall and proximity to markets. The average annual rainfall in the original thirteen states is 43 inches, while the interior Western states see rainfalls of about one-third that amount requiring extensive irrigation infrastructure to support most agricultural crops. In the 21st century this same quirk of geography and access to public lands is driving population growth in the West."}, {"title": "Dinner Party 101: In Which Ann Meets Dr. Skeptic, Part 2", "text": "In the first installment, I left you with the assignment of coming up with a response to a \"skeptical\" scientist who thinks current climate change might just reflect a natural cycle.I suspect that, like me, your first instinct would be to begin building the case, using the scientific evidence, that it's abundantly clear that recent changes are of a scale and tempo that is inconsistent with any past natural cycles. That would, no doubt, have led to a lively debate about whether you were quoting reputable papers and taking into account climate scientists' supposed conflicts of interest. There would also no doubt have been arcane detours into Medieval warming and little Ice Ages. In the end--I'm willing to bet--the attempt to change Dr. Skeptic's mind would have been an epic failure. Even worse, anyone at the table listening to the discussion might have been left with the impression that there is a legitimate scientific debate to be had.So what did I do at my dinner party?Here's what I remember:Me: So you're skeptical about the scientific consensus on climate change? What is it about it that makes you skeptical? Because the consensus among climate scientists is, well, pretty overwhelming.Dr. Skeptic: But scientists are herd animals--they always agree with each other and refuse to listen to the minority opinion.Me: Sure, I've seen that happen in highly specialized small groups of scientists--it can take a long time for results that threaten the prevailing paradigm to get attention.Dr. Skeptic: Exactly! I think that's what's happening here.Me: But this isn't a case of one or two climate scientists trying to prevail on a small number of specialized colleagues to listen to an alternative theory. This is a matter of thousands of climate scientists who've collected all different kinds of data, over the course of several decades, realizing that their measurements and observations are all pointing in the same direction. How many climate scientists do you think there are?Dr. Skeptic: I don't know - under 100?Me: It's more like somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000! And many other kinds of scientists contribute to climate research, such as oceanographers, hydrologists, and marine biologists, so really, the number is much higher than that. For me, some of the most powerful evidence in support of climate change comes from field ecology. Are you familiar with the work of Camille Parmesan at the University of Texas, Austin?Dr. Skeptic: No.Me: Well, she asked a very simple question. If climate change is happening, and the Earth's temperature is rising, what would I expect to see if I looked at species ranges over time?[Now at this point I should have asked him, and allowed him to make a prediction--but I didn't, I just plowed on. Nobody's perfect!]She predicted that to compensate for warming temperatures, species ranges in North America would be moving north in latitude or up in altitude. To test her hypothesis, she did a massive literature search of field ecology studies that measured ranges of all different kinds of plants and animals, including birds, mammals, and insects. She also looked at data sets that have been amassed over time by \"citizen scientists\" --like Lilac Societies that have been noting the date of budburst since the 1800's or the Audubon Society that keeps long-term records on what birds have been seen where. When she put all that data together, she found that, indeed, species have been moving toward the north, or moving higher up mountains. She also found that particular colonies are more likely to have disappeared at the southern or lowermost edges of their ranges, and new colonies are more likely to have appeared at the northern and highermost edges.Personally, (I went on), I find that kind of evidence especially convincing. She doesn't have any axe to grind in the climate community. She just developed a hypothesis and followed the evidence.Dr. Skeptic: Well, I'd never heard that before. That's very interesting.So the rest of the table had been listening to this conversation, and they also found the ecology angle interesting. So I finished up with: \"You know what I think is one of the most striking graphics about recent climate change?\"I then described the USDA planting zone guides that are published every decade or so. They provide quite a striking visual image of what's happening with our climate. I didn't have them at hand, of course, but I hope Dr. Skeptic went and looked them up. Because this is what he'd see--notice the shifts north.Did I change Dr. Skeptic's mind? I don't know. But I certainly made him think a little bit. I didn't get into a debate, and I gave the rest of the table some conversational fuel for the next time they are seated next to a skeptic. Not bad for one dinner party. Give it a try!

The answer, in all likelihood, would have to be no.\"None of us would accept that level of risk for our families,\" argues the Honorable John Gummer, The Lord of Deben: \"So why should we accept this level of risk from those who deny, or dismiss climate science?\"Speaking  before students at London's Imperial College on Wednesday, Gummer argues that one need not believe in the science behind global warming. But, one ought to believe in the risk of ignoring it:\"It is unlikely that all climate scientists bar two should be wrong; that all learned societies bar none should be wrong. Quite simply, it isn't a risk worth taking.\"Yet, in spite of this fact, there are many people on both sides of the Atlantic who continue to deny and reject climate science.The current chairman of the UK's Climate Change Committee, Gummer believes that this is because the issue poses such a radical challenge to our fundamentally imperialistic view of the world:\"Ever since the first village was ransacked for grazing rights, humans have had an imperialistic view of the world, from Rome to Britain to the United States. Even in this post imperial society which we are supposed to live in, most people still look at the world through this lens of empire.\"A member of British Parliament since 1970, Gummer believes that this world view is not compatible with the global perspective required to solve climate change.After all, if the US Republican party were to actually accept the reality behind global warming, then their whole imperialistic \"view of the world collapses, and then becomes unacceptable. So, there is some very fundamental politics involved in this. And, it's the politics of people who want to hold on to the way that things were.\"According to Gummer however, it is the prospect of radical change that is so exciting: \"Not since the renaissance over 500 years ago, are we being asked to look at the world in such a different way.\"Gummer believes that inaction on climate change stems from a myriad of reasons, the first of which is man's innate inclination towards procrastination:\"Margaret Thatcher once said that we all 11 hour and 55 minute people. Right from the time when Saint Paul talked about \"I don't do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don't want to do\", people know very well to never do today what i can put off until tomorrow.\"Yet, although climate change seems like some distant problem, it is the actions that we take today which will shape the very contours of this crisis.After all, carbon pollution remains trapped in the atmosphere for centuries, meaning that even if all emissions were to stop tomorrow, our planet would still warm for several decades to come.According to Gummer, the next problem with climate change is that it has a terrible image problem:\"Bob Dylan had a phrase: \"There is no left wing or right wing, just up wing and down wing.\" And, the up wing part is the crucial part of how we should be looking at this. What you have to do is excite people about the real opportunities involved in living in a sustainable world.\"Gummer also believes that the way that global warming is communicated needs a serious revamp. Instead of citing complicated scientific jargon and facts, he says that it needs to be presented in clear and easy terms which people understand:\"Most of us remember from school geography that the world was once too hot. And, gradually the carbon was pulled out of the atmosphere, making it possible for life on earth to flourish. And, that carbon was laid down in oil, gas and coal.\"\"And, what we're been doing over the last 200 years by burning it, is putting it back into the atmosphere again. So, it shouldn't be too surprising to discover that the world is warming up again.\"According to Gummer, there is no point in getting into a detailed argument about climate science with a denialist as this is rather like getting involved in a dispute with a Jehovah witness:\"You don't win. They're wrong, you know that they're wrong, and every single theological faculty in the world knows that their interpretation of the bible couldn't possibly be true. But, you won't change them if you argue about this line of scripture.\"\"The only way that you can change them is by making people understand that it is unlikely than a man who could not read greek, hebrew nor latin could translate the bible in a way that was better than all people who could read greek, hebrew and latin. The risk of following the Jehovah in regards to truth is thus considerable.\"In other words, the whole argument needs to be reframed in terms of risk.Quoting British politician Lord Gerel Jones, Gummer highlights the grave risks involved in siding with the climate denialists:\"If we go along with 97% of scientists and they're wrong, what have we done? We've cleaned up the atmosphere and we've moved to a more sensible way of power generation that doesn't overexploit our resources, so the downside isn't very big, if they're wrong. But If we went with the denialists, and they turn out to be wrong, then we're buggered up the world.\"Gummer believes that the whole argument against climate scientists needs to be turned on its head. Instead of scientists having to convince the fossil fuel lobby, it should be the other round: \"They have to prove to us that it is safe.\"After all, before a new drug is peddled out before the public, its manufacturers have to conduct countless clinical drugs to prove that it is safe.Gummer argues that as people all have different priorities in life, from religion to hunting to football, the only way that climate change can be solved is by making it simple for everyone:\"We have to make the things that we have to do, easy for people. And, the things that they shouldn't do, hard for people, sometimes by taxation or regulations and together we can make this work. So, we can change the world. But, ultimately, it's about making people understand risk.\""}, {"title": "Donny Rico Schools Chevron on How To \"Be the Victim\" in Ecuador", "text": "Reposted from Eye on the AmazonFirst we're told that money = speech, now we're told speaking out is against the law. If you're not worried about what Donny Rico is talking about, you \"damn well should be!\"Do you care about reining in corporate power and calling out injustice? Your very rights as a citizen? Watch and share the latest in the Adventures of Donny Rico series by Pulitzer winner Mark Fiore, unraveling the tale of Chevron's grotesque abuse of the legal system to fabricate a fraud case against Ecuadorian victims and their lawyers. While this case is under appeal and likely to be overturned, it's been destructive to our work to protect the environment and to challenge corporate misdeeds.Corporate power in America is at an all-time high. The Citizens United decision equating money with speech is a threat to the very foundation of our democracy. And now, thanks to Chevron's actions and a dangerous decision by a federal judge, corporations can also criminalize YOUR speech.Global challenges like the climate change crisis are already being felt around this planet that we share, and our most powerful tool as a caring community is our collective voice. Yet speaking out about making real and lasting change means, among other things, confronting bad actors in the energy industry. U.S. citizens rely on the constitutional right to call out corporate crimes and to pressure them with legal and grassroots actions. But how will shareholders know about activities harming the community and environment if actions to tell them are criminalized and activists intimidated?When Chevron launched its vicious retaliation against Ecuadorian communities, their lawyers and allies, they also included the environmental community. Having 60 law firms and millions to spend, they came up with a nefarious method to strike at us. And rather than suing us head on – which would have opened THEIR files to discovery – they tagged us as \"co-conspirators\" in their RICO action and tried to get the court to force us to turn over ALL of our internal information about their environmental disaster in Ecuador and the campaign to force them to clean it up. Had we not received the excellent pro-bono services of Earthrights International, we would not have been able to fight for over a year to prevent this from happening and to ultimately prevail.Yet Chevron still got a lot of what it wanted. They tied us up, affected our image and may well have scared away much needed support for our work. You and your organization could easily be next. Pro-corporate advocates like the Americans for Tort Reform have called this the \"new playbook to go after corporate gadflies.\"The Donny Rico series from Pulitzer winner Mark Fiore tells the tale in five short animations of how Chevron abused the legal system to fabricate a fraud case against the Ecuadorians and their lawyers. This case is under appeal and likely to be overturned. Regardless, this has done enormous damage to our work to protect the environment and to challenge corporate misdeeds. As the brief filed for the appeal by Amazon Watch, Amnesty International, and 15 other human rights and environmental NGOs states:\"In essence, this case is an effort by Chevron to retaliate against Ecuadorian villagers, their lawyers, and their supporters for suing, bringing public pressure, and petitioning government agencies to hold Chevron accountable for violations of human rights. The district court's decision below, if allowed to stand, poses a severe threat to the rights to expression, association, political participation, and access to courts guaranteed by the First Amendment. If the vaguely defined scope and heavy penalties of RICO – enacted to support law enforcement efforts against organized crime syndicates – may be wielded by private parties against public interest groups and activists who engage in First Amendment-protected activities to seek to hold those private parties accountable, democracy itself is threatened.\"When Amazon Watch issues a press release, holds a demonstration, or even puts out a \"Donny Rico\" animation to educate the public about Chevron's environmental crimes in Ecuador, Chevron charges that we're acting illegally. All this despite our independent knowledge of their acts in Ecuador and over a decade of experience on the ground with the affected communities. Not to mention the recent and damning secret videos we released thanks to a Chevron whistleblower (did you see and share that?!).Donny Rico is a voice for us, something everyone who cares about reining in corporate power and calling out injustice must watch and share. Public awareness of this must grow if we are to defend our right to free speech and implement reforms.

It’s a marriage of avoided deforestation and sustainable commodity production that is projected to pay off in more ways than one.By Allie GoldsteinThis article has been adapted from a longer piece on Ecosystem Marketplace. Click here to read the article in its entirety.1 May 2015 | Last November, a group of Dutch businessmen found themselves far from their desks, standing damp but happy in the Peruvian rainforest, where they’d come to visit the forest they were paying to save.A visit to Madre de Dios in December 2014 brought representatives from Dutch companies to the middle of Sandoval Lake inside the Tambopata National Reserve. | Photograph by Aldo Ramirez.“What is so depressing is I came to Puerto Maldonado 31 years ago,” said Mark Meyrick, who heads the carbon desk for Dutch energy giant Eneco. “That town has not changed materially in terms of development in that time. It’s still pretty dusty, still pretty rundown, still doesn’t have much going for it, and yet there has been a huge amount of environmental damage done in that area and I ask myself, to what end? Who has got rich on this? And it’s very difficult to see anybody has.”His company -- along with the FMO development bank, the Desso carpet company, and a competitor from the energy sector, Essent -- had all invested in a program that might not make people rich, but will at least help them make ends meet while taking pressure off the valuable forest: the Tambopata REDD project, which is nestled in a massive protected area spread across the Tambopata National Reserve and the Buhuaja-Sonene National Park in the Madre de Dios region.An informal gold mining camp near the Reserve. | Photo credit: Ecotierra IncKnown as the “Biodiversity Capital” of Peru, the Reserve provides critical habitat to threatened species such as the black caiman, the harpy eagle, and the giant otter. But more and more people are coming, too: a recent government census puts the human population of Madre de Dios at just under 110,000 – more than 20 times what it was in the 1940s, when gold mining began to draw migrants from the South Andes. The construction of the South Interoceanic Highway, which started in 2006, has accelerated gold mining, wood extraction, and slash-and-burn agriculture..REDD stands for \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation\" of forests, and the Tambopata REDD project began to germinate after the cash-strapped national protected areas authority, SERNANP, awarded a 20-year management contract to the Peruvian sustainable development NGO Asociación para la Investigación y Desarrollo Integral (AIDER). The project aims to save the forest by spurring economic activities that are based on the forest’s conservation rather than its destruction – activities such as cocoa production, chestnut harvesting, small-scale fish farming, and low-impact logging.AIDER aims to work with 1,100 farmers in 19 villages around the buffer zone of the protected regions. These farmers practice migratory agriculture, moving from plot to plot over time and sometimes clearing sections of the Reserve. AIDER seeks to break this cycle by helping them intensify agricultural production on land outside of Tambopata and Bahuaja-Sonene, as well as by planting crops that are lucrative enough that farmers can earn a long-term livelihood from a finite land area.The Tambopata REDD project is expected to avoid the emission of 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. | Photo credit: Ecotierra IncLast year, the NGO helped to form a farmer’s cooperative called Tambopata Candamo, which is focused on harvesting, processing and commercializing cocoa, with a goal of maintaining 4,000 hectares of fine aromatic cocoa trees. With AIDER’s help, they’ve invested in infrastructure such as warehouses, dryers and fermentation facilities, and trucks that will transport the processed product to market. Between the chocolate trees, farmers will also plant other cash crops such as bananas and beans.“Our goal is to avoid the deforestation of almost 12,000 hectares in both natural protected areas in the first 10 years of the project, and contribute to biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development in the buffer zone,” said Paul Ramirez, the project manager.For the project to work, AIDER will have to succeed in the market for REDD offsets, which is currently valued at around $100 million per year, according to Ecosystem Marketplace’s 2014 State of the Forest Carbon Markets report. Governments are currently negotiating how avoided deforestation might be including in an international climate change agreement, but until then the REDD market is entirely dependent on voluntary buyers. Though REDD offset sales are growing, prices are dropping, and last year project developers reported taking home less than 70% of the revenue they needed to keep projects afloat long-term.Slash-and-burn migratory agriculture is the major driver of deforestation in the region. | Photo credit: Ecotierra IncThe biggest challenge so far has been communicating the concept of payment for performance to local farmers, according to Ramirez.“It’s [hard] to make them understand that this is not a donation project, because they are used to NGOs coming with projects as grants and they don’t have to give anything back,” he said. “I think that’s why many projects don’t have the impact that they should have: Because people have machines and they don’t take care of the thing because it didn’t cost them. So this is a different project. It’s not a grant project, it’s a business project.”Click here to continue reading at Ecosystem Marketplace."}, {"title": "Rubbish The Sea Lion Rescued After Wandering The Streets Of San Francisco", "text": "A lost sea lion pup nicknamed Rubbish wandered into San Francisco on Thursday. He crossed a busy road in the city's Marina District, then attempted to elude rescuers by hiding under a car.His rescue became a sensation on social media:Rubbish was eventually caught in a net and placed in a carrier box. CBS San Francisco reports that it took the police and rescuers from the Marine Mammal Center in nearby Sausalito about 30 minutes to catch the pup.The pup had been nicknamed Rubbish by the center during a previous rescue. In February, he was found in Santa Barbara suffering from malnourishment and pneumonia. After being nursed back to health, he was released at Point Reyes in March.It's somewhat unusual for a sea lion to strand itself twice and rescuers will examine Rubbish to see if he is suffering from any other health problems, but he has lost about 10 pounds since his release, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\"We'll fatten Rubbish up and send him home...with a waterproof map!\" the center said on Twitter.Rubbish is also part of a larger problem. There has been a dramatic rise in the number of stranded sea lions since 2013, prompting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to declare an \"unusual mortality event.\" The agency reports that more than 2,500 California sea lion pups have been stranded so far this year.The Marine Mammal Center said that it has taken in more than 1,100 of those sea lions, or more than it rescued in all of 2014. The center says it's on pace to rescue more animals than it ever has in its 40-year history.Warmer waters along the coast have caused populations of prey such as sardines to plunge so sea lion mothers have had a harder time finding food, the Center said. They leave their pups for longer periods, and some pups get so hungry that they head out to sea themselves. Since they are not yet capable of getting their own food, they end up stranded on the coast.“What’s scary is that we don’t know when this will end,” Dr. Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary science at the center, said in a statement last month. “This could be the new normal -- a changed environment that we’re dealing with now.”If you see a lost or stranded sea lion pup, don't attempt to handle it as they can bite and cause infections.

And now, a new report says the drought may be worsening air quality.The American Lung Association's annual State of the Air study, evaluating ozone and particle pollution across the U.S. from 2011 to 2013, found that the region's prolonged dry period, which began at the end of 2011, may be contributing to increased contaminants in the air.\"Many cities had a record number of days with high short-term particle pollution, particularly in the West, where continuing drought and heat may have increased the dust, grass fires and wildfires,\" the Lung Association report says. \"The impact of climate change is particularly apparent in the West where the heat and drought create situations ripe for episodes of high particle days.\"Particle pollution is a \"mixture of acids, chemicals, metals, soil and dust that is formed when emissions from power plants, factories and vehicles react with the air,\" the International Business Times explained. Most particle pollution isn't the drought's fault. It's from burning fossil fuels in industry and cars, and from fires.Still, dry soil as a result of the drought -- its California's worst in 1,200 years -- allows particle pollution to thrive, while wildfires and dust storms send more particles into the air. The five most polluted U.S. cities in both particulate matter categories are all in California.Of the seven U.S. metro areas that had more annual particle pollution than in last year's report, four were in California: Bakersfield, Modesto-Merced, El Centro and San Jose-San Francisco. Each area also failed the national air quality standard.California's Fresno-Madera area's particle pollution improved since last year's report, but it maintained its title as the most polluted metropolitan area for annual particle pollution with an average 47 days per year.Alexander Sherriffs, a physician in the Central Valley and board member on the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, told the Fresno Bee that the health consequences of air pollution are very apparent in the region.“I see lung disease in adults who have never smoked,” he said."}, {"title": "Why the Planet Is Happy That Bernie Sanders Is Running for President", "text": "After lunch, right about the time that Bernie Sanders was actually announcing his run for president, I went for a walk in the woods, and polled three chickadees, two wild turkeys, one vernal pool of chirping wood frogs and a random sample of several tree species. You have to bear in mind that this is in Vermont, so there may be a favorite-son effect, but all of them were overjoyed that Sanders was in the race.And I think I might speak for at least a few other environmentalists who feel the same way. Here's why.First, he's a stand-up guy. When we told him about the Keystone Pipeline in the summer of 2011, he immediately set to work helping us block it. He strategized, he used his bully pulpit in the Senate to spread the word, and he devoted staff time to pressuring the State Department. Contrast that with, say, Barack Obama who was mostly silent about climate change his whole first term, and managed to make it all the way through the 2012 campaign without discussing it. Or Hillary Clinton, who after initially saying she was \"inclined\" to approve Keystone has gone entirely mum on the most iconic environmental issue of our time. Who showed up in New York for the People's Climate March? Bernie Sanders. Who said, straightforwardly in today's official announcement, \"the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is the central challenge of our times and our planet.\" That would be Bernie Sanders.But what makes that really remarkable is, it's not his defining issue. Everyone in Vermont knows Bernie pretty well (it's that kind of state) and so I can say he fits no one's stereotype of an enviro. He doesn't put on a spandex suit and go cross-country skiing; he doesn't, I'm guessing, meditate to reduce his stress levels. He doesn't go on and on about the woods and the rivers -- he goes on and on about working class Vermonters who can't afford health care and heating oil. His issue is inequality and unfairness, and it has been from the start.And for those of us who do work mostly on the environment, that's just the kind of ally we need. Because it's a constant reminder that this battle is for people, who need renewable energy so they can break the constant cycle of struggling to pay the fuel bill, and because it will be the source of good jobs. And because it will be one of the chief ways we break with the plutocrats, many of them in the fossil fuel industry, who are ruining both our atmosphere and our democracy.  Make no mistake -- Bernie Sanders isn't really running against Hillary Clinton. He's running against the Koch Brothers, and all that they represent: taken together they're the richest man on earth. They've made their money in oil and gas (they're the largest leaseholders in the Alberta tar sands, on the far end of the Keystone Pipeline). They spend their money to break unions, to shut out solar power, to further concentrate America's wealth. They'll spend at least $900 million on the next election, and my guess is that if Bernie Sanders catches fire they'll spend far more than that -- because he knows he's got their number. They know, in their heart of hearts, that there's two of them and hundreds of millions of us, and that's got to be a little scary.According to my small survey, America's wildlife loathe the Koch Brothers. And like vulnerable people across the country, they're awfully happy to have a loud Brooklyn-accented voice demanding real, fundamental change.

Red wolves, native to the southeastern United States, were almost driven to extinction by “intensive predator control programs” in the early 20th century, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency began efforts to restore the red wolf population in the 1960s, and today, there are about 100 wild red wolves in the United States, all of which are in North Carolina.An additional 200 red wolves live in captivity, most of which are involved in the Red Wolf Recovery Program -- a USFWS initiative dating back to 1984 that involves releasing captive-bred wolves into wild land in northeastern North Carolina.Photo credit: Chehaw ParkHowever, the plan to replenish the wild population has some hurdles to overcome. In January, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission requested that the USFWS not only end the Red Wolf Recovery Program, but also capture all red wolves introduced to the wild through the program.Wildlife Commission Executive Director Gordon Myers said at a public hearing in February that keeping the wolves on public land is too difficult and that the wolves are a problem for private landowners, according to National Geographic. Myers called the program a failure, noting that it had not yet established a self-sustaining red wolf population.Photo credit: Chehaw ParkThe USFWS has yet to rule on whether it will keep, modify or obliterate the program.Chehaw public relations coordinator Morgan Burnette told the Albany Herald that those concerned about the wild red wolf population should contact their federal representatives to fight the Wildlife Commission’s request.The January request also accused the USFWS of conducting “unauthorized” releases on private land.“We need to prove that the American public cares about wolves, wildlife, and conservation,” Burnette said."}, {"title": "Why I Made 'PlantPure Nation'", "text": "Two years ago, I launched production of a film called PlantPure Nation. The former producer and director/writer of the hit documentary Forks Over Knives joined me in this effort to answer the question most people have after learning of the dramatic health benefits of a whole food plant-based diet: Why haven't I heard this before?Most people can't believe a truth this powerful, one that can heal even serious chronic conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, could possibly have been suppressed. Yet, this is exactly what has happened ... and not for years, but for decades. Research has long suggested that animal protein is not optimal for human health. Senator George McGovern took notice of this fact and initiated an effort in the late 1970s to recommend to the American public that they move toward a plant-based diet. He was soundly defeated, however, by the powerful special interests that continue to this day to profit from the ill health of Americans.The film PlantPure Nation explores the political and economic factors that suppress information on the benefits of plant-based nutrition, while making the connections of this idea to larger issues such as medical practice, farming, and food deserts. Since early April, we have been on a national tour, screening an advance cut of our film. As we travel, we are seeing large and passionate crowds, and as this momentum continues to grow, we will bring all that energy with us to Washington, DC. On May 9, we are holding a rally in front of the White House to voice our support for the powerful truth of plant-based nutrition. And the timing for this could not be better.There is a huge battle being waged now in Washington over the government's nutritional guidelines scheduled for release later this year. On one side are the people who understand the benefits of plant-based nutrition, and on the other side are those determined to maintain the status quo and the economic interests that benefit from this suppression of truth.Rally speakers will include my father, Dr. T. Colin Campbell, recognized by many as the 'science father' of the plant-based nutrition community. Other speakers will include Tracye McQuirter and Drs. Michael Greger and Neal Barnard, also well-known advocates, and myself. Together, we will do our best to give voice to those who are fighting to inform the American people of the enormous control they have over their health.We see this event as the first major step in a new national movement. Our goal is to use our film to inspire a national strategy of launching and supporting local groups committed to spreading the message of plant-based nutrition in their communities. This includes developing a financial engine to help power this movement. We believe that millions of people working together can fix a problem that industry and government largely caused. And we believe this may show a new way forward for how we can solve other of our social problems.For too long in this country, we have tried to engineer solutions to our social problems from places far removed from the people enduring the consequences of those problems. What we need are new strategies that organize and provide resources to people in their local communities so they can participate in making our world a better place.We would like to draw a crowd in Washington, so please consider joining us on May 9. If you are able to come, we also will give you a code for a free online viewing of our film. We promise this will be a fun, memorable, and maybe even historic experience.

Remember that number.If climate change continues unabated, 16 percent -- one in six -- plant and animal species will go extinct, according to a new study published in Science.The report, \"Accelerating Extinction Risk From Climate Change,\" analyzed 131 other studies that diverged widely in their estimates of the rate of extinction that will occur if climate change continues unabated. Some of the underlying studies found that very few, if any, species would disappear, while others placed the number close to 54 percent.Humans still have time to prevent widespread extinction caused by climate change, but the window of opportunity is closing, said Mark Urban, a professor at the University of Connecticut and the study's lead author.\"We haven't seen many extinctions yet, and I think that's because we're still in the area where climate is [playing] a contributing role, but not the final element,\" Urban told The Huffington Post. \"Extinctions due to climate change will emerge out of the noise of all these other factors.\"Urban said the rate of biodiversity loss will accelerate with each degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) the planet warms. Earth's average surface temperature has already increased by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, and animals like polar bears have been struggling in our changing world. Species native to South America, Australia and New Zealand are particularly at risk.\"We're going to have to make some decisions here depending how much the Earth warms,\" Urban said. \"We're going to have to decide where to place those resources.\"Carbon emissions stabilized in 2014 for the first time in 40 years, thanks in part to the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources. But last year was also the hottest year in 135 years of record-keeping.

We all love a home run -- except when it's against our team, of course. So we here at the Sierra Club decided to mix baseball and politics to make it clear just who's playing on the polluters' team and who's on the side of clean air and clean water protections.In \"Scouting the 114th Congress: Polluters Are Out of Their League,\" we scout the best in Congress. We've even made individual baseball cards for the senators featured in the report, to make it clear which team they're playing for. The season in Washington is young, but we've already seen way too many attacks on our clean air and clean water, as big-polluter-backed politicians are throwing beanballs at critically important public health safeguards meant to protect our families and our communities.After all, poll after poll shows that Americans from both red and blue states didn't vote for dirty air, dirty water, or dirty energy last November. Unfortunately, since then members of Congress have cast lots of votes that could threaten our air, water, and climate -- so we're breaking down the box scores with this new report.From the report:Half the fun of baseball is getting to spend time outdoors (you can guess that we're not big fans of domed stadiums), but what's the point when the air is too dangerous to breathe or the water in the dugout is contaminated? Fossil fuel companies and their political allies aren't good sports, and they're pushing an agenda that lets them pollute with impunity. If they had their way, asthma inhalers might end up being part of the uniform for Little Leaguers across the country.Senators were divided into teams: the Fossil Fools, sponsored big by big polluters and going to bat for dirty fuels, dirty air, and dirty water every game; the Clean Air Aces, who are lining up with the American public to score the clean energy, clean air, and climate action that our families and communities deserve; and finally, those players who are on the radar, whom we're watching because they aren't firmly in either team's dugout just yet.Check out our special scouting report for the 114th Congress, see how your senator's playing and who has been sponsoring their work in the big leagues, and find out what you can do to help win the game for healthy families and a healthy planet.Play ball!"}, {"title": "Paralyzed Pup Finds The Strength To Welcome Her Dad Home From Deployment", "text": "Emma is a little pit bull mix with a big personality — and even though a birth defect left her back legs completely paralyzed, this heartwarming video shows that her love is bigger than her disability.Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "Climate Equality: Women on the Front Lines", "text": "You won't find many climate deniers in the remote mountainous villages of Nepal where melting glaciers and unpredictable rain has made subsistence living increasingly precarious. You won't find climate deniers amongst the Carteret Islanders (in Papua New Guinea) who became environmental refugees where the rising tides and increasing storm surges swallowed their homes. Nor will you find climate deniers amongst the Sundarban in Bangladesh, where rising sea water makes it impossible to grow food in the saline soils. Nor are the survivors of frequent storm surges and typhoons in the Philippines and Vietnam likely to deny climate change.For these communities, and for much of the world, the question is not whether climate change is happening: it's whether it's possible to survive it.Perversely, communities that have contributed almost nothing to global emissions are those most affected and threatened by climate change. The USA, for example, emits 176 times more carbon per person than Nepal.Women in these communities are used to having the interests of the powerful put ahead of their right to exist. They are accustomed to having men speak for them. Yet they are also used to acting collectively. A regional programme using Feminist Participatory Action Research (FPAR), is empowering women from some of the most affected communities  to increase their collective power and influence to shape climate and development policies.Displaced women from the Carteret Islands living in resettlement camps in war-ravaged Bougainville are actively shaping the policies of the local government to address the realities of climate change. Facing high levels of food insecurity and illness as well as infant and maternal mortality, the women are pushing for the implementation of an early-warning system for environmental disasters and a facility to serve as a medical center and a transit house to accommodate the steady influx of displaced Carteret Islanders.Women of coastal and highland communities of Central Vietnam have organized to demand recognition for the important position they hold in the fight against climate change. Dependent primarily on rice and aquaculture, their livelihoods are threatened by high tides, sea-water intrusion, sea-bank erosion, typhoons, and water pollution. Acting for their very survival, they have facilitated workshops, disaster drills, and first-aid classes to improve the capacities and resilience of women in the face of climate change. Importantly, their efforts have led to the appointment of more than 60 local women to 12 of the historically male-only Village Rapid Response Teams.In the most remote and poorest villages of Nepal, the Mugal Indigenous Women's Uplift Institute is utilizing traditional knowledge to adapt farming practices to warmer temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns. Leafy greens, previously unable to grow in the cold climate of Mugu, now replace the potatoes unable to grow in warmer temperatures. Traditional rock walls are now used to minimize damage caused by landslides resulting from frequent heavy rains. Grains and potatoes are now stored in wooden boxes buried and sealed with mud to protect the food staples that used to be protected in pits buried into the now-scarce snow.The Mugal women have become a prominent force in addressing climate change, recently organizing the first engagement between district government offices and indigenous women from the villages. They are now working with the Village Coordination Councils to encourage the integration of traditional knowledge in climate-related measures. They are also advocating for the construction of a new drinking-water facility as well as a canal to bring freshwater to operate a watermill recently built to replace those destroyed by landslides.The importance of building women's collective resilience and organizing power is tragically evident this week. The full extent of the devastation brought by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake won't be known for some time. The Mugu villages are at least two-days walk from the nearest town -- and that's when roads are clear and weather fine. While the village is not at the epi-center of the quake, villages like theirs have no choice but to deal with devastation themselves. When landslides have hit their villages in the past, they haven't even been recorded. And it is Nepalese women who will continue re-building their communities and dealing with the collective loss and grief long after the media and aid agencies have gone. We should consider channeling funds to local women's organizations to create sustainable, locally driven recovery.In the remote villages bordering the Sundarban mangrove forests in the southwest corner of Bangladesh, campaigns by a local women's movement have led to remarkable progress in government action regarding climate change and its effects on the daily lives of indigenous communities. Local women's groups started a campaign to address isolation and land-grabbing, which perpetuates women's vulnerability to climate change.Now, government officials in the region are engaging with local women's groups to design climate policies and programs. The Agriculture Extension Office is working with them to develop adaptation and alternative crop production processes. Women are now resorting to planting \"hanging gardens\" to grow vegetables in fertile soil. Government officials have even participated in awareness-creation programs led by the local women's movement. And, significantly, a leader of the movement was recently elected as a member of the Village Committee.What works at the coalface of climate change is ensuring women have the capacity, voice and power to collectively shape climate and development policies.But their work cannot mitigate the impact of climate change. Their work cannot force polluting countries and corporations to recognize their historical culpability for devastating women's lives and the planet. That work has to be done by the people in wealthy nations who recognize that our lives are now bound together. Women of Asia may be the \"canary in the coalmine.\" If women in the Global South with their knowledge, their capacity to work collectively and their ability to live sustainably cannot survive, all of humanity is in real danger.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Aramark has become a remarkable partner with The HSUS, and today, I am so pleased to announce that the company itself has reached new heights when it comes to animal welfare, announcing a game-changing set of new policies to improve the lives of animals in its supply chain and setting the bar even higher for other corporate players in the world of food service and retail.The Fortune 500 company -- which runs the dining operations at thousands of schools and other institutions across the country -- is tackling three key areas where industrial agriculture has been badly failing in its production model: intensive confinement, painful procedures and practices, and unnaturally fast growth.On confinement, the company is eliminating from its supply chain all cages for laying hens (within five years), gestation crates for mother pigs (within two years), and crates for veal calves (within two years). Aramark's policy will ensure that millions of animals won't ever know the suffering that comes from a lifetime inside a cage.Especially within the pork, cattle, and dairy sectors, amputating parts of the animals' bodies -- without pain relief -- is the norm, including castration, tail docking, and dehorning. Aramark sees this as unacceptable and is now working with its suppliers to either eliminate these practices or, at a minimum, use pain killers while its suppliers explore alternatives. For chickens and turkeys, the most painful acute welfare assault happens at slaughter when they're dumped, shackled and dunked upside down in an electrified bath while fully conscious -- and Aramark is now going to work with its suppliers to end that archaic method of slaughter, as well.The company is also addressing the hidden yet serious problem of unnatural growth forced upon farm animals, by eliminating the harmful feed additives and hormones pumped into cattle and pigs, including rBGH, zilpaterol hydrochloride, and ractopamine. It is reaffirming its commitment of refusing to buy foie gras, and will now work with its chicken and turkey suppliers to address welfare issues associated with genetic selection for rapid growth, which produces chronic pain and a lack of mobility in the animals.The collaboration of Aramark and the HSUS may be one of the best examples to date of how a for-profit and non-profit can work cohesively to build a more humane society. In contributing to a humane economy, Aramark is making animal welfare a core tenet of its business model. My hat's off to the company's determined and caring staff for making the world a kinder place and reminding the nation that the biggest companies in the world can take bold action to help animals.Support the work of The HSUS' Farm Animal Protection campaign.This post first appeared on Wayne Pacelle's blog, A Humane Nation."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: California Governor Calls for Aggressive Emissions Cuts", "text": "California will establish a greenhouse gas reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, the state's Gov. Jerry Brown announced Wednesday. The declaration was made just before a speech on the new executive order at the Navigating the American Carbon World Conference in Los Angeles, where participants took to Twitter to reflect on the news. According to Brown's office, the target is the \"most aggressive benchmark enacted by any government in North America to reduce dangerous carbon emissions.\"\"With this order, California sets a very high bar for itself and other states and nations, but it's one that must be reached--for this generation and generations to come,\" said Brown, whose state already has some of the toughest carbon pollution regulations in the U.S.The order requires the state to incorporate climate change impacts into its five-year infrastructure plan as well as its planning and investment decisions.\"Four consecutive years of exceptional drought has brought home the harsh reality of rising global temperatures to the communities and businesses of California,\" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. \"There can be no substitute for aggressive national targets to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, but the decision today by Governor Brown to set a 40 percent reduction target for 2030 is an example of climate leadership that others must follow.\"The commitment aligns with Europe's greenhouse gas target--dedicated ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year. And it is intended to keep the state on track to meet its 2050 target--curbing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050.\"Both California and the EU have set the same 2030 reduction targets--40 percent below 1990 levels,\" said Ashley Lawson, a senior carbon analyst with Thomson Reuters. \"However, California's emissions are currently higher than 1990, while Europe's are lower--so Californians will need to work harder to meet the 2030 target, which we estimate will be in the region of 259 million tonnes (44 percent below the 2012 levels).\"Arctic Council Tackles Black Carbon Plan under U.S. ChairmanshipThe Arctic Council--formed in 1996 by the eight nations adjacent to the Arctic to collectively manage the region emerging as North Pole ice melts--has formally adopted a policy to monitor and report on black carbon and methane emissions reductions. Black carbon--or soot--is produced by diesel engines, fires and vehicle and aircraft exhaust and is responsible for accelerating the speed of warming in the Arctic. The Framework for Action on Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emissions Reductions was signed on the day council leadership officially transitioned from Canada to the United States, which is making addressing climate change \"a key pillar\" of its chairmanship program.A nonbinding and voluntary measure, the framework calls on council members to inventory, in the next six months, emissions of black carbon, which result from incomplete burning of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass and which one council study estimated to have a warming impact 10 to 100 times greater than black carbon emissions from mid-latitude regions (subscription). The framework also calls on members to assess future emissions and to make suggestions to mitigate black carbon.\"Everybody here has talks about the profound impact that climate change is having on this region,\" said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the council's meeting in Iqaluit on Canada's Baffin Island. \"The framework we've worked together to develop expresses our shared commitment to significantly reduce black carbon and methane emissions, which are two of the most potent greenhouse gases.\" He added that the framework sets the stage for the council to adopt \"an ambitious collective goal on black carbon\" by its next ministerial meeting in 2017.As Kerry promised to make the battle against climate change the first priority of the two-year U.S. council stewardship, Kiribati President Anote Tong urged the council members to refrain from approving development projects that would accelerate global warming, which threatens low-lying Pacific island nations.House Committee Votes to Delay Climate RuleIn a 28-23 vote largely along party lines, the House Energy and Commerce Committee moved to delay the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's summer release of the Clean Power Plan until all court challenges have been exhausted. It would also allow states to opt out of complying with the rule, which aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (approximately 30 percent by 2030) from existing power plants under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.The bill will go to the full House for a vote.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

The complete shut-down of conservative dialogue about climate solutions which followed John McCain's 2008 defeat (reinforced by the 2010 defeat of South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis over his climate leadership) appears to be softening. Indeed, libertarian and conservative intellectuals who opposed policy action on climate even during the 2000-2008 period when many Republican politicians looked for appropriately conservative climate solutions are now calling for such actions.One bellwether event is the launch of a new libertarian think-tank, the Niskanen Center,  focusing heavily on climate and energy and led by Jerry Taylor, who served for many years as the Cato Institute's energy maven until he decided to strike out on his own pathway.  Taylor (a friend and colleague) never denied or debated climate science. He did argue against action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. His view was that a) climate change, while real, didn't warrant the kind of action environmentalists were demanding b) if it turned out global warming required big solutions, those solutions would be anathema to conservatives c) those solutions would also be so expensive that they would be easy for conservatives to beat in the political arena.  Jerry has now changed is views. He believes, and is disseminating on the right, a new paradigm a) evidence on the risks of extreme climate change warrants, in purely market terms, much higher prices on GHG emissions as a market measure. b) Carbon taxes can be deployed as a solution with an acceptable risk that they become so bloated that they significantly increase the overall size and burden of government c) Public and elite sentiment for action has become so strong that if conservatives do not offer market based solutions, environmentalists will impose regulatory solutions because the politics has changed.  Taylor's view -- climate action is something conservatives should support -- aligns him with an earlier libertarian who came around, Jonathan Adler of Case Western. (Adler, as late as 2000, was arguing that the only measures warranted to deal with climate were those which deregulated energy markets. But by 2008 he was searching for conservative solutions. Adler was preceded by Ronald Bailey, who in 2005 concluded that scientifically, the evidence strongly suggested greenhouse gas produced global warming.)  Niskanen Center has also posted a very intriguing poll done this spring of oil and gas industry insiders, showing that 75% of the industry believes that global warming is either very or somewhat serious, and 58% thought dealing with it should be a major government priority.  Taylor doesn't cite it, but there is an additional major factor which may have caused a lot of people to shift their view on climate policy: in 1997 when Kyoto was passed, low carbon alternatives to fossil fuels were extraordinarily higher in cost. Now the cost difference between coal generated power and wind and solar is much smaller; in many markets renewables are cheaper. (And in the US natural gas is also impacting the economics of coal.) Electric vehicles are, on a lifetime basis, less costly than many conventional gasoline drive trains. And technologies to greatly increase the energy productivity of our economy have advanced by leaps and bounds. Any reasonable guess on the cost of efficiently decarbonizing our economy has dropped dramatically (even as climate science has made clear that the level of carbon cuts needed is much bigger.)  It's been clear for many years to practitioners on both sides -- if not the media -- that the conservative clam-up on climate was not about the problem, but the solutions. When Taylor debated me in 1995 at the University of Wisconsin, he was blunt, \"If climate warrants significant solutions, they will be global, majoritarian, and governmental -- all the things the right hates.\" At a Trans-Partisan Forum in Gold Lake Colorado in 2005 a group of very prominent conservative leaders, exposed to an early version of Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, summarized their tribal faith as \"the planet is robust, economic freedom is weak\"  and one participant conceded to me, \"we are terrified that climate change solutions will feed the big government beast, Leviathan.\" But there were still conservative voices with the strength to call for action, just as an insurance policy. Even Mike Huckabee joked in 2008, \"if the Lord sends a flood, it's our job to stack up the sand bags.\" When McCain lost, shut. Now it seems to be, cautiously, sliding open again.  Taylor is not alone. The American Enterprise Institute back in 2012 conducted a series of secret dialogues about a carbon tax. When the secret leaked out, the National Journal savaged AEI, mockingly asking, \"What are they thinking about?\"  Now AEI has set up a public set of forums, featuring a Democratic Congressman who has introduced a carbon tax bill. Inglis who has been toiling in the academic vineyards at George Mason University, is getting much more public traction for his work on a carbon tax. Jeb Bush, historically self-categorized as a climate skeptic, recently tentatively suggested that he might be worried about climate change.  This is big stuff -- and not just for climate policy. The shut-down of dialogue on energy and climate which occurred after 2008 -- in my view driven by Koch and fossil fuel money and wedge politics as opposed genuine conservative disbelief in climate science -- was part of a larger disfunction in American politics. Instead of arguing about values, priorities and solutions, the right and left drifted into almost theological debates about reality. That's not what our constitution was intended to accommodate, and our political system for the past five years has signally failed to operate effectively in this atmosphere. And as Taylor points out, neither conservatives nor liberals bring much intellectual heft to the question of precisely how atmospheric concentrations of different heat retaining gasses will influence the weather and climate -- the rainfall over the next decade in California will not be influenced by my views -- very different than Jerry's -- on the proper balance between community and individualism.  Let's be clear. Taylor (or Inglis, or AEI) and I don't agree on the right mix of energy and climate policy. And we probably never will -- our values and political (not meteorological) assumptions vary too much. But perhaps we can now have public conversations out of which our differences might narrow -- and some really bad ideas might at least be let go of by both sides. Galileo was not entirely right. But as long as the Inquisition intimidated believing Christians from entertaining and debating his ideas, the spots where he was wrong were never uncovered. That's where we have been on climate. If I am reading the political weather correctly, and dialogue is about to resume, that is an altogether good thing, which will enable me to explain to Jerry Taylor why I think he is dead wrong on many topics -- and vice versa.  And by the way -- if I am right that one of the forces opening up dialogue is that, really, the cost of low carbon energy vs. fossil fuels is no longer a big deal -- it does suggest that conservatives like Jerry were right in saying that as long as climate solutions meant significant sacrifices, democratic societies were unlikely to embrace them. The engineers and entrepreneurs changed that reality -- not the atmospheric modellers."}, {"title": "Love in Action: Robert Kennedy Jr.", "text": "This past week marked the 45 annual celebration of Earth Day.

Organizing people into cities can be an important strategy for conserving land for farming, biodiversity, and more wilderness; but compact cities and strong towns also improve municipal-service delivery and encourage efficient use of infrastructure investments. Additionally, urban dwellers' lowered individual demands for space and energy make new technological innovations, such as renewables, more viable as meaningful alternatives to current systems.On a global scale, the movement into cities can ironically offer substantial environmental advances. Sustainable cities work for climate change, and in the best cases, they are what's working for other efforts related to health, environmental conservation, and even municipal bottom lines. For example, in the U.S., the average per capita energy use associated with living in a compact-urban setting vs. a traditional suburb is about half for buildings and a third for transportation. The compact setting also encourages physical activity through active transportation and can save the city money on road expansion and maintenance.In the U.S., there is increasing demand for quality urban places to live; however, to date, such places are undersupplied and increasingly accessible only to those of exceptional means. The growing desire for clean, healthy, and aesthetic places to live means smart urban policies can simultaneously improve people's lives and the environment.Many city officials realize the demand for healthy places, and the ultimate goal of creating truly livable and flourishing habitats for humans. Yet the prevailing patterns of highway and automobile-centered mobility investments contribute to the growing trend both in sedentary lifestyles and associated growing waistlines across America and other industrializing nations.In the developing world, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, urbanization rates are the world's highest, and thus represent some of our greatest public-health opportunities from \"Livable Cities\" initiatives. For example, in transportation planning, designing for people rather than for cars has emerged as a golden opportunity to advance public health. In settings like Ethiopia, University of Wisconsin projects include urban planning that is both fitness promoting (via biking or walking) and changing norms so that equitable alternative transportation become the new index for modernization, rather than outdated (and misguided) measures such as number of cars per family. Where highways and roads have yet to be built, there is the greatest chance to pre-empt inefficient and unhealthy investments and to make livable, healthy urban design the norm for emerging economies.Back in the USA, universities can provide struggling towns and cities with an injection of energy and experimentation. Engaging with cities through coursework is a model for service learning that has immediate and obvious benefits for both the University and the partner city. At the same time, \"univer-city\" partnerships push students with experiences that prepare them for life outside campus. Programs modeled after the Sustainable City Year from the University of Oregon are being adopted around the country, and are putting the \"public\" back in public institutions by pairing city projects with existing coursework.To generate new knowledge, educate tomorrow's leaders, and serve larger communities it would behoove nearly every subject being studied at universities today to reframe questions by considering the role that cities play in answering them. The potential solutions emerging from campuses should be tested in real-world settings. Cities provide such a setting with the complexity that universities require for multidisciplinary problem-based research. Strengthened relationships between cities and universities can be fundamental to rolling out new technologies -- and evaluating existing ones -- that can help establish Livable Cities across the globe. The renewed coordination of university rigor, student enthusiasm, and city pragmatism provides great examples of what's working for local and global problems, and it's the kind of thing we're working to encourage.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Days later, after turning the final page, I regretted recommending it. Of course I didn't hate the author - but I sure hate that book.The last thing mother earth needs right now are yogurt weaving earth mothers like Naomi Klein.Which is a shame, because in the first hundred pages, Klein does a brilliant job.\"We know that if we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, climate change will change everything about our world,\" the introduction proclaims. \"All we have to do is not react as if this is a full-blown crisis.\"Klein provocatively but convincingly argues that the political right has a far better grasp of the magnitude of the climate challenge than those on the left: either we rapidly and fundamentally change the way the global economy works, or we will cause a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.American conservative's climate change denial is driven not by their ignorance, she claims, but by their acute awareness of the fundamental economic restructuring required to cut down carbon emissions enough to avert a worldwide catastrophe.Klein goes on to connect some of the dots between capitalism and climate change, persuasively arguing that privatized power utilities and free trade agreements in particular can lock entire cities and even countries into high carbon pollution trajectories.She mercilessly savages moderate environmental NGOs for accepting funding from major polluters and working with industry to pursue incremental approaches and technological fixes to an existential threat that requires, above all, one radical solution: leaving most of the world's known carbon reserves in the ground, forever.And then Naomi Klein blows it.For the next three hundred plus pages, she drags the reader along on a syrupy tour of the entire new age kitsch pantheon, from the \"brave\" climate warriors who chain themselves to bulldozers over \"a lone Mi'kmaq mother kneeling in the middle of the highway before a line of riot police, holding up a single eagle feather\" to the goat herding yogi who \"can feel the earth breathe,\" before finishing up by literally dolloping out wisdom from her womb.Having thus alienated mainstream readers - exactly the people the climate change movement most urgently needs to reach out to and bring on board - Klein then blocks meaningful debate among the already converted:\"Meeting science-based [carbon] targets will mean forcing some of the most profitable companies on the planet to forfeit trillions of dollars of future earnings by leaving the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. It will also require coming up with trillions more to pay for zero-carbon, disaster-ready societal transformations... if climate justice carries the day, the economic costs to our elites will be real.\"Get real, Ms. Klein.Seen from a global carbon budget perspective, every person living in a developed country is a member of Naomi Klein's (conveniently undefined) \"elites.\" Simply by living when and where we live, we are all stakeholders in Exxon Mobile, Shell and BP, like it or not - through the nice warm houses we live in and the cars we drive, through the cheap food we eat and the decent public services we enjoy.And as long as 'we' keep consuming, 'they' will keep producing to meet our demand.Let's briefly remember what happened when BP shares plunged after the U.S. pressed for massive compensation after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Suddenly, in the immediate aftermath of a highly publicized oil spill, top British politicians lined up to defend BP, severely straining transatlantic ties.And they did so with public support. \"One pound of every seven pounds of dividend income paid into our retirement funds came from BP's rich legacy of oil discoveries around the globe,\" the British Daily Mail helpfully reminded its readers. The effects of just one compensation claim, against one fossil fuel company, caused a democratic backlash.Forget the Koch brothers. Big Bad Oil has three far more powerful supporters: You, Your Money & Your Vote.To suggest, as Naomi Klein does, that all 'we' need to do is stand up to 'them,' force evil corporations to leave lots of carbon in the ground, strike a few zeros off some faceless billionaires' bank accounts to cover the bill, and then happily carry on living the good life is trite and, ultimately, dishonest.A fascinating paper by behavioural change expert Dr. Jonathan Rowson sizes up the real magnitude of the challenge:\"The value of the world's economy is based on stock portfolios that depend upon 2,795 gigatonnes of carbon from the proven oil, gas and coal reserves that haven't yet been burned. While these fossil fuels are still physically in the ground, economically they are above ground in the sense that they are reflected in share prices, collateral for company loans and national budget calculations. Those 2,795 gigatonnes of reserves have an estimated market value of 27 trillion US dollars, which means keeping to the 565 gigatonne carbon budget [needed to avoid catastrophic levels of warming] is tantamount to writing about $20 trillion off the value of the global economy, which - to put it mildly - is unlikely to happen. By way of comparison, the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market (which triggered the last recession) only wiped out around $700 billion ($0.7 trillion) from the worldwide market.\"That leaves us with three forms of climate change denial.Even the much-maligned cheerleaders of global capitalism at the World Bank now warn that \"if the world warms by just 2°C (3.6°F) - warming which may be reached in 20 to 30 years - we could see widespread food shortages, unprecedented heat-waves, and more intense storms.\" Yes, the video below was produced by those evil bankers in Washington D.C.The third form of climate change denial is the facile line peddled by Naomi Klein & Co.It's the convenient and self-righteous fairy tale that a sinister capitalist cabal of corrupt politicians, shadowy lobbying groups, and Big Bad Oil are to blame for the current crisis, and that averting disaster is simply a matter of 'us' taking back control and forcing 'them' to pay the price for the necessary economic transition.Capitalism versus Climate: Do we really need to choose?Having seen communism with my own eyes before it collapsed (an extremely ugly sight), and having worked and conducted research in developing countries for years, I deeply appreciate the blessings of global capitalism, most of all the way in which it has enabled hundreds of millions of people to break out of desperate, heart-breaking, soul-crushing poverty.Denying the benefits of global capitalism - warts and all - is every bit as idiotic as denying that climate change is happening.The challenge we face now is twofold.But please, no more yogurt weaving earth mothers, and no more polar bears."}, {"title": "Circus Cat Living In Car Freed From Life In Chains", "text": "A sad, emaciated puma who spent his life chained to the open back of a car — the only home he'd ever known — is finally free.Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "Where Does California's Agricultural Water Go?", "text": "Water plays a vital role in California's agricultural sector, using 80 percent of the water used by humans in the state. In recent months, water challenges imposed by the current severe drought have brought this agricultural water use into the limelight, raising new questions about how the water is used. A new \"Need to Know\" brief authored by Heather Cooley and the Pacific Institute, provides essential background information on the state's agricultural water use: in particular, the brief estimates total water applied for crops grown in California, the water intensity of those crops, and the economic productivity of water.Among the key findings are that alfalfa is the largest single consumer of water, using over 5 million acre-feet per year (in 2010 -- the last year for which consistent and comprehensive data are available), and produces about farm revenue of around $175 per acre-foot of water. Almonds and pistachios together use around 3.3 million acre-feet of water and produce around $1,150 per acre-foot of water. (An acre-foot of water is around 326,000 gallons, or the amount of water needed to cover an acre to a depth of a foot.)These indices for a range of crops are shown in Figures 1 and 2 below, and details on the full analysis are in the report, available free from the Pacific Institute.Figure 1. Water applied to crops, in acre-feet per year (2010). Used with permission.Figure 2. Revenue by crop, in $ per acre-foot. Used with permission.Questions around agricultural water policy are complicated and the report clearly describes these different factors. Heather Cooley notes, for example, that while these values\"provide some insight into choices that farmers make, agricultural decisions cannot be made based only on economic productivity numbers. No one would propose, for example, that only vineyards be planted because of its high value per unit water or that no field crops be grown in California.\"The report also notes that there are large uncertainties in agricultural water use due to a lack of consistent measurement and reporting, time lags in information, and confusion about definitions. Data on agricultural production and water use are not collected at all, or are collected by individual irrigation districts, counties, and a variety of state and federal agencies using a range of tools from voluntary reporting at the field level to remote sensing from satellites. Additional estimates of water use come not from actual observations or reposting but from model estimates and other techniques for projecting use.The report argues that in order to truly understand the risk and opportunities for water use in California, more and better data are needed."}, {"title": "3 Ways to Get Your Dog Into Show Biz", "text": "Tischman Pet PhotographyLights, camera, action!Bamboozle -- my 10 pound trick dog, sat poised off camera, awaiting his signal. As I steadied my outstretched palm -- his signal to stay -- I waited for the director's cue.In sequence, the cameraman gave a thumbs up, the director pointed to me and me to Boozle. A blur of white arched onto the green screen and faced me, as I maneuvered below the camera's lens. As if by wizardry he stopped dead center and shook as if he'd just emerged from a swimming pool.Cut!!!It was a metal-worthy performance, captured in just under 3 seconds.Eyes bounce from one to another. It looked good. Was it good? I think it was good. It was really good.Typical verbiage on a commercial shoot or so I was told. Take Two!Thirteen retakes later, and the jury is still out as to whether they will use Boozle's enactment, or another slightly larger dog rendition.The bottom line? There's far more glamour in the pet entertainment industry, than money or fame. Our Brooklyn adventure involved a full day of shooting -- not to mention 3 hours travel time, and a film crew of 20+ to capture what amounted to 39 seconds of footage.Have I piqued your interest? Are you envisioning your dog's image blazoned across the big marquee?While most people's training goals begin and end with come, others strive for a more elaborate repertoire of learned behaviors. Many of these enthusiasts are clients. In my book Dog Tricks and Agility for Dummies, I outline over 100 tricks -- known in professional circles as behaviors, that can be easily taught once a dog has learned some basic skills, such as down, which can lead to rollover, crawl and play dead; holding skills can be expanded to carry, fetch and deliver; and jumping maneuvers, can be directed through a hoop or window frame, over a hurdle, or into someone's arms. Next time you're watching a dog on the big screen, look through the eyes of a trainer and trace their gaze.Is the dog focused on the action? Not really. He's clueless as to the story line.Is the dog trying to please the director? No, no. Could live without the director.How about the victim-anything going on there?Wrong again. It's unlikely that the dog has socialized with anyone on set. The dog is watching one person only, and that is his handler, who is strategically positioned out of the frame. For their part, dogs are probably the most welcome cast member on set, never demanding anything more than their fair share of kibbles and a comfy pillow at the end of the day.For his part, Boozle had to run to a target square (I used a business card-sized cut of green screen to condition him), angle 90 degrees to face the camera and offer a full body shake. In the editing room he'll be superimposed on a stack of towels. What is the goal of this accomplishment, which took 8 training days to perfect? To touch American hearts with his puppy dog enthusiasm and, ultimately to increase detergent sales.Think one of your pets might have what it takes to carve out an acting or modeling career? You'll need to attract an animal agent -- no one will hire you from a photo, even one that's professionally taken. Agencies carry insurance and their directors have an established relationship with ad agencies and producers.Sitting down with my pet's agent over coffee -- Cathryn Long, herself a Scarsdale native and principal of All Creatures Great and Small, I hounded her for more sage wisdom. Here are the top tips she offers anyone longing to get their dog into show business:1) Steady Around Distraction Cute and clever dogs are everywhere! People are right to think they would shine in front of a camera -- most do. But to be considered for stardom, any pet -be it a dog, a chicken or even a lizard, had to be steady around distractions. A lot of stuff happens on set that people don't think about. First there are lights. Big. Bright. Lights. Next there is the camera -- and we're not talking about an iPhone here. The cameras are large and mobile, often maneuvered during a shoot to capture at various angles.2) Well Socialized  Next there is the crew. Some still projects -- for a Kohl's catalog, for example, may have as few as 2 or 3 photographers assigned, while a Vogue shoot with Keira Knightley had a swarm of people. Before she signs a pet, Ms. Long conducts an interview, to not only meet a candidate, but to see how they will stand up to distractions.3) Impulse Control  Dogs should be steady with the 4 D's -- a term Ms. Long shared with the Today Show when she went on to talk about getting dogs into show business (this clip can be found on her website).Discipline Even modeling dogs must be trained to the basics and tolerate long periods of containment. All day shoots can offer a dog little stimulation; each dog must be well schooled. Distraction Commercial shoots and movie sets are full of commotion! Acting dogs must stay focused no matter what's going on around them. Distance  While trick training is fanciful and fun, a dog needs to learn targeting. This involves going out, then stopping on a disc, eventually at a distance of 20 feet, to perform a specific behavior.  Duration  Two things can derail even a well-mannered dog, and that is duration and repetition. On set, a dog may have to hold a given position--say lying on a couch with its head between its paws, for up to an hour. Of course there are breaks, but they have to do it over and over and over until the director says we're done. This is why Border Collies make wonderful clients-they'll repeat a behavior all day if asked. Mildly compulsive, they never get tired or bored.Animal agents need all types of dogs in their roster. Rarely do they get to dictate what type of dog should be used. Ms. Long looks for fresh faces of all types--which can be quirky-looking mix breed dogs too (those are especially in these day) and for any type of pet who is steady and calm. Even rabbits, hamsters and lizards--as long as they've been socialized to all sounds and stimulations.Think your dog has what it takes? I know a good agent!"}, {"title": "Tracking Fish Oil Supplements to the Source", "text": "Are fish oil supplements really improving our health but hurting our oceans?That's one question New York Times bestselling author Paul Greenberg is exploring for his next book, The Omega Principle: The Health of Our Hearts, the Strength of Our Minds, and the Survival of Our Oceans All in One Little Pill, due out next year.Fish oil pills are made from forage fish, some of the most important species in ocean food webs. These small fish, including menhaden and sardines, are a vital food source for many marine animals, including whales, dolphins, seabirds, and fish that people eat, such as grouper, snapper, and salmon. At the same time, forage fish are also used to make products such as fertilizer, cosmetics, and fish meal for aquaculture and animal feed. As a result, in some parts of the world, overfishing has caused forage fish populations to plummet.Global demand for forage fish is surging. The small species are used to make products such as fertilizer, cosmetics, and fish meal for aquaculture and animal feed.Greenberg has made a career out of seeing a story behind almost every fish. In his popular books Four Fish and American Catch, the lifelong angler examined the forces that get seafood from the ocean to our dinner plates. He related tales of greed, hunger, politics, international affairs, and crime on the high seas, stories that raise questions about how we treat the oceans to serve ourselves.His ability to see the stories behind seafood began as a teenager. He grew up fishing in Long Island Sound, a pastime his mother encouraged because, he recalls, she considered it a \"manly, character-building activity.\" Similarly, his father, a film critic, writer, and psychiatrist, saw it as a way to entertain his son on weekend visits and eventually encouraged him to submit an article about fishing to the weekly angling magazine New England Fisherman. Later, after earning a bachelor's degree in Russian studies from Brown University and then spending six years working to establish independent media in Eastern Europe, Greenberg launched his writing career by returning to where he started: writing articles about fish.Now the award-winning New York City-based writer is investigating the push and pull between human demands on forage fish, the impact on the ocean, and the responsible stewardship of this precious resource. His work comes during his three-year tenure as a Pew marine fellow.Paul GreenbergHe's taking a hard look at fish oil -- which, he recently told me, is the third-largest-selling supplement in the United States and a $34-billion-a-year global industry. In this case, he's also stepping squarely into the debate about heart health.\"I'm a middle-aged guy. I have all the issues: cholesterol, forgetting things, anxiety, sleeplessness,\" said Greenberg, 47, who takes the fish oil supplements containing omega fatty acids. \"These omega-3s do come across as the fountain of youth.\" But as he's swallowed his daily dose, Greenberg's thoughts have wandered toward the sea. Beyond their usefulness as ingredients, these small fish are the lifeblood of the oceans that sustain us: \"Maybe [they're] the elixir of life itself.\"Atlantic menhaden are caught by the hundreds of millions each year.Greenberg's work comes as forage fish are making headlines -- despite not being well understood by the public. Recently, fishery managers along the West Coast of the United States agreed to prohibit commercial fishing on seven groups of forage fish unless scientific analysis shows it won't harm marine ecosystems or compromise fishing for valuable predators such as salmon. In June, Florida wildlife managers will discuss the management of forage fish in that state's waters.And in May, East Coast fishery managers might consider changing catch limits on menhaden. Dubbed \"the most important fish in the sea\" by author H. Bruce Franklin, these fish are captured by the hundreds of millions every year and ground up to make fish oil, fish meal, animal feed, and other products. Managers reduced menhaden catch limits for the first time in 2012 to keep more fish in the water to feed the many animals that depend on them, such as striped bass, ospreys, and humpback whales. A recent assessment shows some improvement in the health of the menhaden population, although the number of fish remains near a historic low. The industrial menhaden fleet wants catch limits increased, so fishery managers need to employ the most up-to-date and comprehensive ecological and biological analysis to help pinpoint how many menhaden should stay in the water as food for marine animals.Predators like this tarpon make meals of forage fish. Forage species are critical food sources for animals, including whales, dolphins, seabirds, and larger fish such as snappers and groupers.But in many ways, these challenges are not new. Greenberg points out that forage fish have been used to make products for thousands of years, dating to the Roman Empire, when some species were ground up to make a product called garam, which could be considered something close to today's ketchup. Now, millennia later, both Greenberg and I think it's time to finally consider forage fish in a broader sense.\"The real question is: Where does a fish like a menhaden have its value? As fish meal and oil or in a matrix of the food web?\" says Greenberg. After decades of research, he believes -- as I do -- that when managing our fish resources, we should pay more attention to the diverse ecological roles fish play in marine environments, rather than setting rules that consider only one species at a time. \"What are these rules doing to the other fish?\" Greenberg asks.\"With seafood you're dealing with hundreds if not thousands of species that interact with human destiny in different ways at different times,\" Greenberg told me. \"People say they relate to the ocean through seafood. I try to tie ocean issues to people. I want to put positive, science-based ideas into the world.\""}, {"title": "Global Businesses & Climate Change: Don't Get Left Behind", "text": "Here's a simple fact: taking decisive action on climate change will cost us less than failing to do so.At Unilever, we operate in 190 countries with two billion people using our products daily. We take climate seriously because we know that it impacts those two billion people -- and that means it impacts us, too. A changing climate already costs Unilever between $300 million and $400 million every year -- mainly because of droughts and flooding -- manifestations of climate-induced extreme weather that will only become more frequent in the future. When the climate hurts, people and businesses also feel the pain.So we decided to act.We teamed up with other global companies and governments and civil-society groups to form the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, aiming to eliminate deforestation from the supply chain of palm oil and other key commodities like soy, paper and pulp, and beef. Halting all tropical deforestation and forest degradation could reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 3 gigatonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent per year. By comparison, total greenhouse-gas emissions in 2011 were 45 gigatonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent. At Unilever, we already source all of our palm oil sustainably, and we are working hard to reduce our reliance on GreenPalm certificates and achieve our target of 100% traceable and certified palm oil by 2020.This is just one of many ongoing public-private international-collaborative efforts proving that companies can drive a reduction in emissions without hurting economic performance.Global businesses and investors are taking the lead in this crucial battle. More than 4,000 major companies are reporting their greenhouse-gas emissions, sending clear signals to their investors that they are serious about reducing the carbon pollution that is destroying our climate.Investors with more than half of the total-institutional assets ($45 trillion) under management have subscribed to responsible-investing principles, with climate-risk management now becoming part of their fiduciary duty. And major players like Apple and Google are investing in huge renewable-energy projects and energy-efficiency initiatives.The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, comprised of leaders from business, government and academia and of which I am a member, reported last year that the world will require $90 trillion of investment in infrastructure over the next 15 years. This money will be invested anyway but we have the opportunity to invest it wisely, setting us on a low-carbon-development pathway.There are a number of things we can do to increase the efficiency of our transition to an environmentally friendly, equitable world. For example, building more compact cities with good mass-transit systems would substantially reduce pollution and generate savings of more than $3 trillion over the next 15 years. And restoring just 12% of the world's degraded lands to production would feed another 200 million people without having to raze forests.Leading businesses are making large strides in ensuring a sustainable future, but ultimately, they can only do so much. In many countries, unpredictable signals on climate policy make it difficult for investors to make the right long-term choices. And subsidies to polluting fossil fuels persist, having reached an estimated $550 billion dollars in 2013, and continue to send the wrong signal. What we need are consistent and credible policy signals from governments that decisively shift us to a low-carbon-development pathway.This kind of transformation needs ambitious government action at both the national and international levels in order to unleash the significant economic benefits.To achieve policy stability and certainty, we need to establish a meaningful price on carbon and cut the billions of dollars spent each year on fossil-fuel subsidies, along with well-structured financial tools and rules. By reaching an ambitious and equitable international agreement in Paris at the end of the year, governments can assure investors that all countries are heading in the same low-carbon direction.This, in turn, will lead global businesses like ours to direct investment and innovation in everything from clean-energy alternatives to smart infrastructure to agricultural technology, beyond what has been possible until now.We are already responding to the climate challenge. It's time for governments to join us in ensuring better growth and a better climate for all.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Those experiences transformed us, made us into the turtle warriors we are. Face it, how many of your high school friends are reading about global sea turtle population trends right now?None, that's how many. So, how did that feeling of awe convert into what may be best described as a life dedicated to turtle-centric altruism?A typical, oft-repeated and unquestioned adage is: \"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.\" Those of us who do environmental management, who have been involved with successful conservation work and movement building, know that statement is BS. The most important things we manage are not (easily) measurable -- from the quality of our new team members to the awe and wonder that's at the root of why we care in the first place. Our greatest successes sometimes occur: (a) In spite of government agencies' denials of decades of well-considered science, (b) In the face of barely quantified threats, or (c) Alongside massive holes in our understanding of basic sea turtle biology and life history.The \"measure to manage\" dogma found its place as militaristic styles expanded into business, and business expanded into our professional relationship with nature in the post-World War II industrial era. The language of targets, tactics, strategies and enemies now pervades agency- and NGO-speak alike. But, when the value of sea turtles to humans is reduced to what's easily measured with our standard metrics and sorely limited resources, we run the risk of getting things dangerously wrong.Ecology and economics provide a clean, clear, yet wildly incomplete, even cartoon-like framework for analyzing the values of nature. Consider this familiar balance sheet. In one column (A) is the commodified value of sea turtles as resource: eggs, meat, shell, oil. In the next, (B) is the value of sea turtles as eco-tourist attractions: hotel rooms, park fees, guides, meals, travel. If the number at the bottom of column B exceeds the value of column A, sea turtles get to live (in theory, at least). The conversation has been expanded in recent years to include a third column called \"ecosystem services\" that provide public benefits. Those benefits include dune stabilization, sea grass maintenance and even climate regulation, as provided by the trophic cascades, at the top of which are often found sea turtles and other predators.Fortunately, the conversation around valuing nature is expanding quickly to include the cognitive, emotional, psychological and social benefits that we know are real drivers of the human nature relationship. When neuropsychologists and conservation biologists team up, the results can be revolutionary. Consider a few of the real but rarely described benefits of working with sea turtles.Awe and WonderNew research suggests that the feeling of awe is good for our health, boosts empathy and compassion, and helps connect us to the people and places around us.Feelings of awe are some of the most cherished and transformative experiences in human life and are generated by art, music, architecture, but most often nature. Dr. Paul Piff of the School of Sociology at University of California Irvine defines awe as \"the sense of being in the presence of something bigger than oneself that current knowledge structures cannot accommodate and that allows people to rise above stimulus-response patterns and lose themselves in an all-encompassing event.\"Scientists have made evolutionary arguments for the universality of awe and how it has likely evolved. Other studies find that awe may enhance our memory of events, play an important role in morality, make people less self-focused and more prosocial, lead to enhanced generosity, increase virtuous behavior, reduce feelings of entitlement and increase helping. Current studies show that feelings associated with awe can reduce cytokines (proteins important for cell signaling), chemicals associated with disease and even inflammation.Yet, some people live wonder-free lives. For those who work with sea turtles, awe can be a daily experience. When we share our work, we make the world better. More sea turtle lovers equal more ocean advocates -- a virtuous, positive feedback loop.Solitude and PrivacyOur lives are becoming more and more connected, and time spent truly alone with ourselves and our own thoughts is sadly minimized. A recent study in Science demonstrates how uncomfortable solitude feels to college students: two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt after a mere 15-minute period of solitude. One man -- considered an outlier -- found quiet thinking to be so disagreeable that he opted for a shock 190 times. In these modern times, our written and spoken words, as well as our physical movements, are almost constantly monitored by strangers, government agencies and marketers. And this loss of solitude and privacy adds to the stress of life.Being near, in, on or under water can be a refuge or escape, and that relationship can have the same positive benefits mentioned earlier for awe and wonder. A beach or a bay can provide a rare retreat from technology. And those are the settings in which work frequently places us fortunate souls who are turtle professionals.Creativity and InspirationArtists and engineers, musicians and entrepreneurs, writers and scientists rely heavily on their ability to generate creativity -- combine old ideas and pieces to make new ones -- to think of things that have never been thought of. It's no surprise that great thinkers such as Sir Isaac Newton, Oliver Sacks and Albert Einstein found inspiration outside under a blue sky or beside flowing waters. Free from walls and over- stimulation of modern, urban existence, our brains work differently. That's not to say better, but there's a certain kind of expansive thinking that's facilitated by blue space.Perhaps there's no better place to experience awe, creativity, inspiration, privacy, solitude and wonder than on a sea turtle beach. Humans have depicted their appreciation for the ocean and sea turtles through art for millennia. You've had much the same experience as our ancestors on the beach at night, face to face with our beloved chelonians. As a conservation or research professional, student, seasonal volunteer or wayfaring traveler, being with sea turtles in nature changes us. We become better versions of ourselves.These are big ideas that are tricky to assign numbers to, but important to put into words, with ever-increasing clarity and rigor. Quite literally -- as well as poetically -- being with sea turtles is good medicine. And here's a prediction: In the not-so-distant future, medical professionals will prescribe two weeks of volunteering on a turtle beach for what ails their patients.This essay first appeared in the annual State of the World's Sea Turtles report.

Is this evidence of CO2-induced global warming?Similarly, in an August 4th Washington Post interview at the most recent summit of Charles Koch's donor network, Mr. Koch again walked himself in circles on the climate question:Q: Are you worried about climate change?Original Post: As the nation warily watches every Republican presidential candidate kiss the ring of billionaire donor Charles Koch for a shot at his network's $300,000,000 pool of presidential cash, Charles Koch did something unusual.Last week's USA Today interview with Charles Koch noted his shifting opinion on what he calls climate change \"hysteria:\"For the record, Koch says this of climate change: \"You can plausibly say that CO2 has contributed\" to the planet's warming, but he sees \"no evidence\" to support \"this theory that it's going to be catastrophic.\"Wait...Charles Koch just accepted that the planet is warming?Hold your applause. Clearly, Mr. Koch still denies that there's a problem - which means he's missing the entire point of discussing climate change.But any movement from Charles on the 5 Stages of Climate Denial--from #1 down to #3--is a big deal. This is the same guy who has poured $80 million into organizations that have misrepresented climate change science to the public and advocated against any viable solutions to the problem.Last June, leaked recordings surfaced from Koch's regular meeting of millionaires and billionaires who are coordinating $889 million in spending around the 2016 election.Charles's Koch top strategist Richard Fink indicated that we may see a shift in Koch's rhetoric on climate change. Fink, aka \"Charles Koch's Brain,\" told attending prospective donors what they wanted to hear: donate to us, and we'll fight the crazy commie hippies and their pesky science. From the Undercurrent:\"The environmental movement. Occupy Wall Street. These kids are searching for meaning. They're protesting the 1 percent. They are the 1 percent, but they're protesting the 1 percent. The environmental movement and climate change. It's not about climate change.For context, you should probably know that Fink told the room's billionaires that the minimum wage would lead to fascism, comparing today's low-income Americans to pre-Nazi Germany citizenry. Not exactly a room full of academics.And since one of the people that Mr. Fink 'meets with' was a scientist that he funded to study global temperature data, you have to wonder how much experience Rich Fink has with willful ignorance.Charles Koch cannot deny is that he's seen the global temperature record data. In 2011, through the Charles Koch Foundation (CKF), CKF president Richard Fink funded a high-profile study on global surface temperature data. This dataset, which was an unnecessarily redundant reproduction of several other similar studies, was constructed by a scientist who at the time was a climate change denier.BEST data compared with previous reconstructions of global surface temperature data.Dr. Richard Muller's Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study (BEST) made headlines when he announced his acceptance of what climate scientists had already been saying for over 15 years--yes, people are responsible for unnatural climate variability that scientists have documented--and surprised the country by becoming an advocate for solutions to global warming.This put Mr. Koch in an awkward spot. Koch's $150,000 grant to Dr. Muller made him the project's top single donor, and Muller was a celebrated skeptic before his dramatic change-of-heart.Add to that Mr. Koch's background in science--a chemical engineering degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For such an educated, celebrated albeit controversial high-society businessman, the refusal to acknowledge science that is understood by middle schoolers guaranteed to undermine the sensible reputation that Koch Industries has spent a lot of money to put out there.But Charles gets no credit here. Dumping almost $80 million into organizations that have attacked the scientists who study climate change and interfered with virtually every proposed policy and regulation to solve global warming isn't being an science-savy CEO. It's being a denier, and especially in the context of a self-serving petrochemical billionaire, that's pretty offensive to the rest of us.We define climate change denial as \"anyone who is obstructing, delaying or trying to derail policy steps that are in line with the scientific consensus that says we need to take rapid steps to decarbonize the economy.\" Mr. Koch remains a staunch denier in that regard.The Koch brothers continue to finance campaigns to make Americans doubt the seriousness of global warming, increasingly hiding money through nonprofits like DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund.Why focus on Charles Koch and David Koch? Many large foundations associated with corporate fortunes are active in financing climate denial groups - Anschutz, Bradley, Coors, DeVos, Dunn, Howard, Pope, Scaife, Searle, and Seid, to name a few.Unlike Koch, most of those fortunes did not come from owning a corporation like Koch Industries, historically rooted in fossil fuel operations. And none come as close as the Kochs in terms of decades-long focus on actively building a political influence network and coordinating other wealthy executives, corporations and families to dump amounts money into politics that not even the Koch brothers could afford.Check out Greenpeace.org for more research on the Koch brothers crusade against climate science.

Now think about this: in the time it took to read that, you probably took 4-5 breaths. Makes you want to know what was in that air, doesn't it?We strongly believe that everyone has the right to breathe healthy air, and that begins with knowing the quality of your air. So for the past 16 years, the American Lung Association has undertaken the \"State of the Air\" report, which examines air pollution levels across the U.S. This year's report shows encouraging progress, evidence of the success of our long fight for cleaner, healthier air for all Americans. Paired with that progress, however, is evidence of troubling challenges. Both underscore the urgent need to continue to defend the Clean Air Act, which protects the air we all breathe.The American Lung Association's annual \"State of the Air\" report reviews monitoring data on the two most common and harmful types of air pollution - ozone (smog) and particle pollution (soot) - and compiles a \"report card\" telling how much of each type of pollution is in the air where you live and breathe. Why is this important? Because both ozone and particle pollution can harm your health - even shorten lives. Medical science warns us that air pollution does more harm to our health than we previously thought, and at lower levels.Dangerous levels of air pollution can harm everyone, even healthy adults. However, those at greatest risk include infants, children, older adults, anyone with lung disease like asthma and COPD, people with heart disease or diabetes, people with low incomes and anyone who works or exercises outdoors. High levels of pollution can cause severe asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes. Recently, the World Health Organization concluded that particle pollution can cause lung cancer, the #1 cancer killer in America.\"State of the Air 2015\" gave reason for celebration but also identified areas of growing concern. The best progress showed in levels of year-round particle pollution, which have been steadily improving. For that you can thank the transition to cleaner diesel fuel and engines and steps taken to clean up power plants, especially in the eastern U.S. The American Lung Association has pushed long and hard for these changes. We are pleased to see that those steps not only reduced particle pollution, but also helped many cities reduce their ozone pollution as well.Unfortunately, not all news was as good. While some cities improved their ozone, other cities got worse. Dangerous short-term spikes in particle pollution increased in many cities, particularly in the western U.S., with some cities showing their worst problems since the report began.What's up with the spikes in soot and continued high-smog days? Two words - climate change.Climate change creates the ideal conditions for both particle and ozone pollution. Warmer weather increases the risk of ozone pollution and makes cleaning it up even more challenging. Rising temperatures also increase droughts, wildfires and other sources of particle pollution. While our report shows steady improvement since our first \"State of the Air\" 16 years ago, it also shows evidence that the changing climate will make it harder to keep up this trend and protect human health. Bearing the greatest burden will be children with asthma and the elderly, and other vulnerable populations.I repeat: everyone has the right to breathe healthy air. That's why the American Lung Association has been fighting for healthy air since before the Clean Air Act was signed in 1970. Today, we continue to speak up for safeguards that ensure cleaner, healthier air for all Americans. We must meet our air pollution challenges head-on to protect the health of all Americans, especially the nearly 33 million people in the U.S. living with chronic lung diseases, like asthma and COPD.Want to see how your community ranks, as well as the lists of most-polluted and least-polluted U.S. cities?

So Why Aren't They Everywhere?", "text": "The case for garden-based learning in schools seems simple, even obvious, at first: What harm could there be in encouraging young children to connect with nature and learn more about the ecology around them, including where the food they eat comes from?But given the ever-growing demands on teachers’ time and the poor financial health many of the nation’s school districts are in, the obstacles facing the school garden movement in the U.S. are clear.Both the challenges and possibilities are discussed at length in Ripe for Change, a new book on garden-based learning written by Jane Hirschi and published earlier this month. Hirschi is the founding director of CitySprouts, an initiative based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that seeks to establish gardens as learning tools in public schools nationwide.“School gardens, it turns out, are amazing places for kids to learn basic academic subjects, to understand what science and the natural world are all about,” Hirschi told The Huffington Post.The idea that gardens can be a learning tool dates back to the 19th century, according to Library of Congress researcher Constance Carter. Educational reformers Friedrich Froebel, Maria Montessori and John Dewey were supporters of learning gardens. Carter also notes that as early as 1902, Dick Crosby of the Department of Agriculture remarked that \"children develop a feeling for the beautiful\" through their experiences with school gardens.\"They become neater in their habits, less troublesome, kindlier; they take pride in keeping the schoolyard neat,\" Crosby said. \"And the influence extends beyond the school grounds to the homes.\"More recently, chef and restaurateur Alice Waters and First Lady Michelle Obama have emerged as vocal proponents of school gardens.In 1995, Waters established the Edible Schoolyard at the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley, California. Her goal was to create and sustain an organic garden that was fully integrated into the school's food program, as well as its curriculum.“I felt like I could change the world, if we all changed the way we ate,\" Waters explained to Time last year.Soon after moving into the White House, Obama enlisted a group of local fifth-graders to help her plant a massive vegetable garden on the South Lawn, as part of the diet and exercise initiatives she champions. Earlier this month, another group of young students joined her to take part in the garden's annual replanting.“My hope,” Obama told The New York Times in 2009, “is that through children, they will begin to educate their families and that will, in turn, begin to educate our communities.”First Lady Michelle Obama harvests vegetables from the garden with children from Washington's Bancroft and Kimball Elementary schools on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)It was Waters who inspired Hirschi, a lifelong backyard gardener, to start working on school garden advocacy full-time in 1999, when her oldest daughter was just beginning school. During a show-and-tell day, Hirschi introduced her daughter’s class to gardening through simple classroom activities. Students, teachers and parents all reacted so enthusiastically that Hirschi realized she needed to share her message with more kids.Then a part-time adjunct lecturer at Boston University, Hirschi got to work. In 2001, she launched CitySprouts, a nonprofit initiative that today partners with 20 elementary and middle schools in Boston and Cambridge to build and help maintain gardens. The gardens serve a student population of 6,000 students total, over half of whom come from low-income households.“It took off in spite of my having no useful skills to build a nonprofit program like this,” Hirschi explained. “It was the teachers’, the kids’ and the families’ response to it that moved it forward.”After CitySprouts partners with a school, the program works with teachers there to help them find connections between mandated curriculum and in-garden learning opportunities. For instance, Hirschi's book describes a cider-pressing activity that can be linked to both math word problems and writing lessons.The program also provides on-site garden support throughout the growing season, including classroom visits from “garden experts” and assistance with constructing and maintaining the gardens. CitySprouts operates programs in all of the K-8 schools in the Cambridge public school district, which funds one-third of the gardens’ operating costs, while private donations and grants cover the rest.According to Hirschi's book, CitySprouts looks at four metrics to assess its level of success: whether participating students’ academic engagement increased, whether the students began making healthier food choices, whether students demonstrated understanding and appreciation of nature, and whether teachers reported an increased capacity to sustain school gardens as a practice.A student participates in a CitySprouts program around edible gardens at a partner school.So far, the results have been encouraging. According to an outside evaluation of the CitySprouts program published in 2012, teachers at participating schools reported that students were more engaged in garden-based lessons compared to in-classroom lessons, and that the program helped students better understand science concepts. Teachers also said they believed the program especially benefited students who were learning English and those who were struggling to learn via more traditional methods.CitySprouts is not alone in reporting promising outcomes from students participating in garden-based learning, though the evidence is often anecdotal.In Washington, D.C., the district’s Office of the State Superintendent of Education has had its own dedicated school garden program since 2010, the only program of its kind to be fully funded by public money. The program, which coordinates the efforts of government and nonprofit entities to build and maintain gardens, serves an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 students at 93 public, charter and private schools citywide. According to the program's latest annual report, 49 percent of D.C. schools had gardens as of last year.That report found an increase in the number of students who reported after participating in the program that they helped prepare meals at home. In addition, a greater number of teachers agreed after participating that they believed their students would benefit academically from the program and that it would positively impact their food choices. Other metrics, however -- such as the number of students who said they liked to eat vegetables and the number who agreed that \"it is important that my school has a garden\" -- showed little change.Some studies that have taken a closer look at the direct academic impact of school gardens have also had encouraging results. In 2013, Dilafruz Williams and P. Scott Dixon conducted a comprehensive review of 20 years of literature on programs of this nature. Of 22 studies included in the review, 93 percent reported improved student performance in science, 80 percent saw improvement in math and 72 percent noted improvement in language arts. Williams and Dixon's analysis also noted, however, that more rigorous research on the topic would be beneficial.The need for better research on the impact of garden-based learning is at the heart of criticism of the movement. In a scathing article in The Atlantic in 2010, Caitlin Flanagan described the trend as “a giant experiment, one that is predicated on a set of assumptions that are largely unproved, even unexamined.”“That no one is calling foul on this is only one manifestation of the way the new Food Hysteria has come to dominate and diminish our shared cultural life,” Flanagan contended.Another challenge that skeptics point to is that teachers are already so overwhelmed with demands on their time -- thanks to a number of factors, including standardized testing and educational standards outlined by Common Core and Next Generation -- that it becomes difficult to implement garden-based learning in a meaningful way. But Hirschi argues that the method can easily align with the experiential learning encouraged by those standards.As for the question of teachers' time constraints and the related matter of funding, Hirschi compares the need for garden-based programs to the need for young students to have access to technology, claiming that both are cost-effective means to accomplish an important end.“There’s a public feeling that all schools should have those [technological] resources, that kids need to be literate in technology or they’ll be missing something big,” Hirschi said. “Ecology is the other half of that, it's a yin-yang relationship. We need to make the case that kids need both, not one or the other.”"}, {"title": "Nestle Denies California Bottled Water Factories Contribute To Drought", "text": "Nestle, the world's largest food company, on Tuesday defended its bottled water operations in drought-plagued California after critics slammed the company for commoditizing a natural resource.\"I know some believe that drought conditions should bring the bottling of water to an end,\" Tim Brown, chairman, president and CEO of Nestle Waters North America, wrote in an op-ed for the San Bernardino County Sun. \"Experts on water use who have studied the issue have recognized, however, that bottled water is not a contributing factor to the drought ... Nestle Waters operates five California bottling facilities, using a total of 705 million gallons of water per year. To put that amount in perspective, this is roughly equal to the annual average watering needs of two California golf courses.\"Nestle's defense of its bottled water business comes after the California-based Courage Campaign began circulating a petition this month demanding the company cease bottling water in the state. Nearly 29,000 people have signed the petition.Nestle, based in Switzerland, is responsible for less than 0.008 percent of California's total water use, the company said. Critics said the number shows an incomplete picture.\"While Nestle's claiming that, as a percentage of statewide water use, bottling is not that significant, the reality is that these facilities do have real impact on the local watersheds where they're bottling,\" Adam Scow, California director for the environmental group Food and Water Watch, told The Huffington Post. \"That's the appropriate way to assess the impact of bottled water facilities, and given the reporting we've seen at what's going on at two facilities ... Over time there is a real impact, especially when you have a drought.\"Pressure on California watersheds, Scow said, is greatest near Nestle's bottling facilities in Cabazon and Ontario. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, groundwater levels in Cabazon have been declining significantly, but it's unclear whether Nestle is responsible. The facility is located on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians' reservation, the Desert Sun reports, which is exempt from water agency oversight. Nestle's water factories in Los Angeles and Sacramento use tap water. Cabazon draws water from a spring.Food and Water Watch is among conservation groups critical of water bottling, saying it privatizes a natural resource. Bottled water consumes 1.39 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of bottled water, Scow said. He said that's not a good use of resources, no matter how little of California's water the industry uses.\"This does not constitute reasonable, beneficial use,\" Scow said. \"Allowing a foreign-owned company to bottle our public water and profit on exporting it out of the state is not a good use of our resources. And on the consumer end, for the most part, Californians have great water that's tested much more vigorously that bottled water is.\"Nestle also come under fire this month after an investigation by The Desert Sun found that the company's permit for transporting water across the San Bernardino National Forest expired in 1988.\"Since this issue was raised and I became aware of how long that permit has been expired, I have made it a priority to work on this reissuance project,\" San Bernardino National Forest Supervisor Jody Noiron told The Desert Sun. \"[...] Now that it has been brought to my attention that the Nestle permit has been expired for so long, on top of the drought … it has gone to the top of the pile in terms of a program of work for our folks to work on.\"The U.S. Forest Service did not immediately return The Huffington Post's request for comment.In his op-ed, Brown argued it's inaccurate to describe the permit as expired.\"Like several hundred other special permit holders in the San Bernardino National Forest -- and some 3,000 nationwide -- whose permit is under review, our permit remains valid and, according to federal law, 'does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.'\""}, {"title": "Surviving the Everest Avalanche", "text": "On April 10th, after an unsuccessful attempt at climbing Mt. Everest last year, I was back at base camp to try again. I was excited, determined, and hopeful that I would finally fulfill my dream of standing on the top of the world.However, this year had been an unusually snowy one for Everest. Within just a couple days of reaching base camp, we had over two feet of snow dumped upon us. Everyone thought it was a good sign, as more snow meant the rock higher up the mountain would stay glued together.I was the expedition leader of a very strong team of climbers from across the world, and I was ready to take on anything with this group. Our days acclimating to the altitude were passed refining our climbing skills, taking short walks near the base camp to stay fit, engaging in lively discussion around world economics, politics, mountaineering and, of course, catching up on movies.When the day finally came to start climbing Everest, we were ready to go. Our years of training and patience were all going to be put to the test, although we could never have known that it would be the most difficult of our lives.We began our first acclimatization rotation, during which we climbed through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall and stayed one night at the first camp. The following day required a much more difficult and higher climb to camp two, located at the base of a formidable 3,000 foot wall of snow and ice -- the Lhotse face. Our team successfully completed both the objectives, and I, once again, proved to be the strongest climber on the team, which felt earned. I had worked really hard to train this past year, determined to make up for my last attempt.On April 25th, we descended the Khumbu Icefall in the early morning through white out and heavy snowfall. We returned to base camp by 10:30 a.m., grateful for the extra oxygen, despite it still being thin air. All of us changed clothes and sat in the dinner tent discussing what we had learned over the last two days.And then suddenly it happened. The ground started shaking. I could feel it. I tried to tell everyone what I had just felt. Everyone dismissed me. And then, the ground started shaking harder. This time everyone took notice. I shouted, \"Earthquake!\" as we all exited the tent. The entire ground was shaking like I'd never felt before.Because we were stationed on a glacier, everyone was concerned that the very ground beneath us would open up and swallow us whole. However, I was far more concerned about an earthquake-induced avalanche, and how it would impact the Khumbu Icefall and camps above. I knew there were many people still up there.But, no one thought about the potential, and very real, avalanche danger at base camp. Huge hanging glaciers surrounded us: Pumori, Lho LA, Nuptse; they could all destroy us in a moment.And then the earth stopped shaking. For a moment we were relieved, until our worst nightmare came true with the loudest noise of our lives. We instantly knew that an avalanche had occurred somewhere, but not sure where. Our first thought was Lho La near Everest, so we turned our attention to that direction.However, it only took a few seconds to realize something was amiss. People had started running towards Lho la. How could this be possible? Why would people run towards danger?And, that's when I realized the avalanche was actually right behind us.We turned around to find ourselves face to face with a huge white cloud, possibly the largest thing I had ever seen in my life, approaching us at an unreal speed. We had no time to react or think through next steps. The only thought that was able to cross my mind in that moment -- this is the end of life.Death is a constant for any climber, and something I think very seriously about before every expedition. But thinking about it is one thing; I had never actually been this close. I thought the moment had finally come.I was with two other teammates as the avalanche cloud descended upon us. We took shelter behind a tent when the cloud hit. Within seconds we were all covered from top to bottom in inches of snow, cutting off the already thin oxygen. Buried under the snow cloud's wake, I felt as if someone had put a plastic bag around my face. It felt like it took super human effort to suck any air into my lungs. I surely would have suffocated had it not been for my good friend, Jost, who saw my struggle and opened his hard-shelled jacket for me to come inside and breathe.Those first molecules of air entered my lungs, making me feel like a newborn baby taking his first breaths. Fitting, seeing as I had received a second life. I knew it then, and I will know it for rest of my life, that I will forever be indebted to Jost for his generosity in dire circumstances.Once the cloud passed over, we did a head count of our entire team. Everyone was doing fine. However, a significant part of the base camp was devastated with camps torn apart, debris laying everywhere, injured people, and a few unfortunate souls who had lost their lives.We knew what had happened to us was tragic, but once we heard from Kathmandu, notifying us about the devastation that had occurred across Nepal, we were distraught to learn about the thousands dead and the millions displaced from their homes. It began to sink in that this wasn't a mountain-climbing causality; this was a disaster of unprecedented levels.I was heartbroken. I still am. My heart goes out to everyone who lost their lives or loved ones in the earthquake.The following video has gone viral across the world and prominently features myself along with two other team members, Jost from Germany, and Taro from Japan.Watch \"Hit by Avalanche in Everest Basecamp 25.04.2015,\" and follow my journey to Everest at http://fuel.callfire.com."}, {"title": "Energy Efficiency in Bloom", "text": "Each Spring, our environment transforms as bare tree branches sprout new buds that blossom into a refreshing palette of color that replaces the muted tones of winter. While this year's peak bloom has come and gone in many cities, a different blossoming occurred this past week that befits business owners, building operators, and city leaders across the country.Transformation is underway in our built environment--and last week there were three developments of note.First, last Monday, Atlanta became the first major Southeast city to adopt an energy efficiency policy that focuses on tackling building energy use and waste through measures such as benchmarking, transparency, and energy audits.Second, the unanimous City Council approval of Atlanta's Commercial Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance was followed by Portland, Oregon's City Council unanimously approving an Energy Performance Reporting Policy for buildings over 20,000 square feet.This is not a situation where two events are just a coincidence. What we are seeing is energy efficiency blooming across the country. The passage of Atlanta and Portland's policies make them the 12th and 13th city, respectively, to adopt benchmarking as a way to drive energy efficiency investment and improvements, joining the ranks of leading U.S. cities such as Austin, Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., in passing this type of legislation.If you still need convincing that there is a market shift underway, look to the U.S. Congress, which on Tuesday passed the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, a targeted energy efficiency bill that, among other provisions, addresses energy use benchmarking in federal leased buildings. It's the first energy bill passed by Congress since 2007, and makes three notable building energy policies passed in three days. (In full disclosure, my nonprofit, the Institute for Market Transformation, advised city leaders in both Atlanta and Portland on the development of their policies, and provided input to Congressional staff as they drafted the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015.)Savvy building owners and city leaders are already aware of the benefits that these types of practical policies offer--energy savings and financial savings (such as 2.4 percent energy use reductions annually or 7 percent over three years), along with job creation and market competitiveness. Atlanta's policy alone is expected to generate more than 1,000 local jobs, and local businesses in other markets with existing benchmarking and transparency laws have reported significant new demand for energy efficiency services, and are hiring new employees after the adoption of a benchmarking ordinance in response to demand driven by increased awareness of building energy efficiency opportunities. As for market competitiveness, studies have shown that nationally, energy efficient properties have occupancy levels up to 10 percent higher, rental premiums over 10 percent higher, and sale prices up to 25 percent higher than less-efficient properties.Consumers benefit from efficient buildings, too. In 2009, CBRE and the University of San Diego surveyed managers of companies who had moved from standard buildings into more-efficient buildings (as qualified by an ENERGY STAR label or LEED certification). Of the respondents, 42.5 percent reported that employees were more productive after the move, and 45 percent agreed that employees were taking fewer sick days. In addition, 15 to 25 percent of respondents perceived higher employee morale, less turnover, and greater ease of recruitment in the energy efficient buildings.The Federal government is aware of the opportunity here. In an Executive Order issued on March 19 titled Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, President Obama specifically identified building energy efficiency as a main step in meeting sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction targets, and directed Federal agencies to conform, \"when feasible, to city energy performance benchmarking and reporting requirements.\"Across the country, improving building energy use should be top of mind for all building owners and city leaders. After its citizens, buildings are typically a city's most valuable assets, and property costs have a direct impact on building owners' bottom lines. In many cases, however, it's shocking how little is known about these structures.The building sector is the single largest user of energy in the United States, accounting for roughly 40 percent of total energy consumption. Each year, we spend $450 billion on energy for our buildings, with a good chunk of that money being wasted on inefficient systems and structures--the poorest performing buildings consume three to seven times the energy of the highest performing buildings for the exact same use. The widespread lack of knowledge about how our buildings are performing translates to a massive missed opportunity.Building energy use policies begin to address this critical knowledge gap. Atlanta's new ordinance, for example, combines several powerful tools that together can provide unparalleled insight into these valuable assets. Benchmarking--the process of measuring a building's energy use over time--establishes a baseline as to how a building is currently performing and allows for comparison to past performance as well as peers. In conjunction with this information, energy audits (which examine potential opportunities for improvement through new or upgraded building systems) empower owners to focus on the most cost-effective options for their building and their business.In a national survey by Building Operating Management magazine, more than 70 percent of facility managers surveyed used benchmarking information to guide energy efficiency upgrade plans, and 67 percent used it to help justify energy efficiency improvements. Providing building performance to the public through transparency policies better informs leasing and purchasing decisions; it enables the market to function properly and reward efficient buildings with higher occupancy and faster lease-up, creating a virtuous cycle of competition to operate buildings efficiently.Last week's developments show that the transformation to a future where every building is an efficient building is underway, as a growing number of public and private sector leaders make their buildings more efficient and healthier and, by doing so, make their cities and businesses more prosperous and resilient.

His previous owner had been abusive and when Donahue saw him, she knew she had to take him home.That day, she promised to keep Dillon by her side for every moment -- even if that meant taking him on her mile-long swims in the ocean.Six years later, Dillon gives new meaning to the term \"doggy paddle.\"Three times a week, Donahue goes for a 1.2-mile swim at Kailua Bay on the Big Island -- with Dillon, in a dog flotation vest, leading the way.\"Dillon has become quite the legend,\" Donahue said. Around town, she said, locals call him IronDog because their swim path -- known as the King's Buoy swim -- is along a pier and out to a swim buoy in Kailua Bay, which is also home to the Hawaii Ironman's 2.4-mile swimming race.\"It is absolutely hysterical when swimmers encounter Dillon in the open ocean,\" Donahue said. \"Their reactions are priceless.\"Kawika Singson, a fellow swimmer and local photographer, estimates Dillon can finish his 1.2-mile round-trip race in an impressive 45 minutes.Donahue isn't sure what type of breed Dillon is, though she's been told he could be a Belgian Malinois or German Shepherd. Regardless, he is a good dolphin pointer.Since pods of dolphins frequent waters around the pier, Dillon keeps an eye out for them while they swim.\"[He] is my dolphin spotter,\" Donahue said. \"When I see [Dillon's] ears perking up, I know the dolphins are close by. ... [He] rides on my back when we are surrounded by pods of dolphins.\"Donahue said they've even swum over reef sharks that were sleeping at the ocean floor. \"The experience is beyond magical,\" she said.On Sunday, Singson caught up with Dillon during a swim and snapped a few underwater photos of the athletic canine.\"There's a lot of stand-up paddleboard dogs out there,\" he said, \"but Dillon is the king of the King's Buoy swim.\"Below, watch Dillon the IronDog enjoying his second chance at life in the open ocean."}, {"title": "How Big Is Your Water Footprint? You'll Be Surprised.", "text": "Drought is all over the news. California is at the center of the coverage and rightly so, given the severity of the situation there. But take a look around the rest of the country and the Golden State is not alone.Washington and Oregon, states many associate with constant drizzle, have alarmingly low snowpack and declared drought emergencies across large portions of their land. Parts of the southern Great Plains are seeing failed wheat crops and dust storms, while southern Florida is experiencing a severe drought. No part of the country is immune to drought, and in fact water managers from 40 U.S. states anticipate at least some form of water shortage within the next 10 years.For many of us, these current and future water crises mean we need to use water as productively as possible and cut back on waste. But to get there we first need to know how much water we use every day, and most of us have no idea.GRACE Communications Foundation built the new Water Footprint Calculator to help people figure out how much water they use through a series of simple questions about their daily routines. The calculator accounts for not just how much water we use from the tap, but also the water it takes to produce the food we eat, the energy we use and the products we buy. This is called \"virtual water,\" and it is by far the biggest part of our water footprint.The almond and its surprisingly large water footprint (one gallon - per nut!), has recently become the poster child for virtual water, but this world of hidden water is far bigger than thirsty almond groves. Consider these surprising numbers on the unseen water in everyday items:When Governor Brown signed his executive order calling for less lawn watering and other cutbacks to Californians' home water use, it was another example of how we often address water shortages: Namely, cutting back on the water that pours out of our garden hoses, showerheads and faucets. These are certainly important changes that have an immediate impact on the crisis at hand. But according to the Water Footprint Calculator, the typical American uses about 2,200 gallons of water per day, and virtual water use makes up the vast majority of this water footprint.Addressing our virtual water use is the real opportunity to make our communities more resilient to drought and other extreme weather events, although this requires us to think longer term. While turning off the tap as you brush our teeth will immediately save a gallon or two, skipping one hamburger is not going to put 660 gallons in your local reservoir. We need to think of the big picture and in creative ways. Choosing pasture-raised instead of industrially produced meat, for example, will support farmers who don't rely largely on feed grains irrigated with limited groundwater or surface water supplies. Investing in energy efficiency or even renewable energy at home will help reduce our need for water-dependent power plants. Avoiding \"fast fashion\" clothing brands and instead buying vintage or well-made and long-lasting pieces will reduce how much water is required to grow cotton and manufacture your clothes.These are just a handful of many individual choices that can help us use less water, and collectively, they all send a signal to those who make what we use and the products we buy that we want a more sustainable future.Water is indeed everywhere, but it is also needed to do just about anything. The important first step that we can all take right now is to find out how much water we really use. The daily choices we make to waste less water today, whether directly through the tap or virtually through our food, energy and shopping habits, can help us make sure that there's enough for all of us now and in the future."}, {"title": "Nature's Trust (Part 4)", "text": "When we find a failure of governance or regulatory systems, we have always as recourse taken the issue to court to apply the legal tools of law. We know that judicial principle and precedent can be a basis for an argument intended to redress wrong and restore justice. If you accept that the principles on which American environmental law was based in the 1970s has been compromised and excepted subsequently to dilute protections, regulations and enforcement to an unacceptable circumstance, then we have but one tactic to fall back on: lawsuits to force the issue, re-assert the principles and reverse the destructive trend. And that is exactly what citizens in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have chosen to do.In the Netherlands, some 990 Dutch citizens have filed suit against their government for \"failing to effectively cut greenhouse gas missions and curb climate change.\" According to the website Climate Progress, \"The plaintiffs will ask the court to force the Dutch government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 and 40 percent relative to their 1990 levels by 2020 -- reductions that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said developed nations must make if the world wants a 50 percent chance of avoiding a 2 degree Celsius increase in global temperature. Currently, the European Union has committed to reducing its emissions 40 percent by 2030, but the Netherlands has not made any specific commitments, saying instead that it intends to adopt any international agreement that comes from the Paris climate talks later this year.\"The class action was supported by the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch organization devoted to sustainability and climate advocacy. The Netherlands is certainly vulnerable to extreme weather and sea level rise; indeed have been leaders for centuries in the design and construction of dykes and coastal barriers and other engineering systems to protect the 25 percent of the national land mass that is below or at sea level. The urgency of the changing circumstance has not been lost on the Dutch government and various new schemes to innovate and protect against further inundation have been put forward. But the plaintiffs argue that that same government has been not aggressive enough in addressing the root problem requiring much stricter emission controls and faster shift to alternative and renewable energy generation. The judicial proceedings will stake place over the coming months, and Urgenda is mobilizing publicity and support from citizens in Holland and throughout the European Union.A similar, extraordinary movement has been quietly underway in the United States led by the Oregon-based not-for-profit Our Children's Trust (OCT) devoted to \"a game-changing, youth-driven, global climate recovery campaign, securing the legal right to a healthy atmosphere and stable climate\" through legal action, youth engagement, and public education and film. The organization, along with five individual teenagers, and two other non-profit organization representing thousands more, partnered to bring a federal suit to the U.S. Supreme Court designed \"to require the federal government to immediately plan for national climate recovery according to the scientific prescription of Dr. James Hansen and other leading international climate scientists that will restore our atmosphere to 350 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 by the end of the century and avoid the disastrous scenarios of 2°C of warming. This lawsuit relied upon the long-established legal principle of the Public Trust Doctrine, which requires our government to protect and maintain survival resources for future generations.\" On December 8, 2014, the Court declined to hear the case, and Our Children's Trust responded as follows: \"Our Children's Trust has been building new federal cases on behalf of youth to secure science-based climate recovery policy nationally, and will return to the Supreme Court if necessary. We will expand our efforts to enforce individual states' responsibilities to preserve the atmosphere for the benefit of future generations, and we will advance select global and local efforts to do the same. Piecemeal legislative and executive actions not based on nature's laws will simply never get us where we need to be. We need judicial declarations that government must act systemically to stabilize our climate.\"OCT is pursuing legal remedies in State courts with some successes. Cases are pending in New Mexico, Oregon, Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington, and North Carolina, with courts in Alaska, Texas, Arizona, Kansas, Montana, and Pennsylvania issuing developmental decisions along the way on which the pending suits are based. In addition, Our Children's Trust has sought administrative rule-making decisions in various agencies in all fifty states as another means to make the argument and compel consideration of the legal principle.OCT asserts: \"Specifically, these court decisions have rejected many legal defenses raised by our opponents, including non-justiciability, standing, separation of powers and sovereign immunity. In support of our youths' positions, and in face of argument to the contrary, the courts have validated critical climate science and reserved for the courts the exclusive right to determine whether a particular commons resource is protected by the Public Trust Doctrine for benefit of present and future generations, and whether there has been a breach of that trust.\"We need a children's crusade based on the Public Trust Doctrine to take back our future with Nature. With this work, in the U.S. and abroad, the crusade has already begun."}, {"title": "Little Fish Win Big Protections From Commercial Fishing", "text": "The humble, tiny forage fish -- think herring or smelt -- may appear to play small roles in a vast ocean, but don't let their size deceive you. Forage fish are truly the pillars of healthy ocean ecosystems and sustainable marine food webs, supporting the diets of whales, dolphins, sea lions, many types of fish and millions of seabirds. And when well-managed, they will play a key role in feeding people, too.Last month, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of eight regional fishery management councils in the U.S., took a tremendous step forward towards protecting these important fish. In a groundbreaking move, the Council voted unanimously to protect seven groups of forage fish from 3 to 200 nautical miles offshore Washington, Oregon and California. The new rules protect these fish by requiring that both human needs and ecosystem benefits are considered if these small fish are ever commercially targeted.Now, hundreds of forage fish species within these seven groups -- round and thread herring, mesopelagic fishes, Pacific sand lance, Pacific saury, Silversides, Osmerid smelts and pelagic squids (other than Humboldt squid) -- are safeguarded. These fish and squid play vital roles in the foundation of the California Current ecosystem, one of the most globally important and productive ecosystems in the world that supports endangered sea turtles, fragile corals, large whales, economically important fisheries and much more.The Council's decision is truly a landmark move that could act as a model for a shift in fisheries management. Historically, most fisheries have been managed on a species by species basis, focusing on maximum catch and profits without taking into account the needs of the ecosystem as a whole. But under this new approach, the Council is protecting fisheries with an ecosystem-based method that will protect wildlife species, help support recreationally and commercially important fisheries and ensure long-term sustainability of the ecosystem into the future.This victory also marks a tremendous achievement for Oceana, who has called on the Council since 2009 to protect these forage fish. Protections are important to ensure there is abundant prey for ocean predators and a healthy source of high protein, heart-healthy fish for human consumption for generations to come. It is expected that the National Marine Fisheries Service will implement the Council's recommendation after a required federal rulemaking process.While this action is a big step forward, fisheries for forage fish like Pacific sardine and anchovy desperately need a better management approach. This approach should consider how much of these important fish must be left in the ocean to support other marine life, provide for continued fishing opportunities and supply healthy meals to people into the future.There are already 7 billion people on Earth, and this figure is expected to grow to a staggering 9 billion people by 2050. If existing forage fisheries are managed sustainably, with an ecosystem-based approach, these small fish could directly feed millions more people a healthy seafood meal each day, helping to meet some of the world's hunger needs while simultaneously sustaining the oceans."}, {"title": "Senate Committee Advances Chemical Safety Reforms", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee advanced legislation on Tuesday that would update the nation's 39-year-old law governing chemical safety, over the objections of some Democrats on the panel.The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, introduced by Sens. David Vitter (R-La.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.), passed by a vote of 15 to 5. All Republicans on the committee voted for the bill, along with four Democrats. The version passed in the committee was a \"manager's amendment\" that included some significant changes in response to criticism of the bill's original version, which Vitter and Udall introduced in March. The updated version picked up the votes of Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), and Cory Booker (N.J.), who had all advocated for changes.Vitter praised the bill's passage, calling the legislation \"an honest, balanced approach built on compromise.\" Udall also celebrated the advancement of the legislation, noting that it \"isn't a perfect bill, but it is a very good one.\" The bill updates the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, which has been widely criticized for failing to adequately regulate the thousands of chemicals currently on the market.The new version includes some major changes to the federal provisions that preempt state laws on chemicals. It would give states more leeway to set their own regulations on specific chemicals while the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of making a federal safety determination, and ensures that if the EPA doesn't meet deadlines for making a decision or for acting on a state's waiver request to set their own rules, that state will be allowed to move forward with its own regulations.The legislation also excludes state chemical disclosure laws from preemption, as well as any state regulations that fall under clean air or clean water laws. It pushes back the date after which state laws are set to be preempted by federal laws from the original bill's deadline of Jan. 1, 2015, to August 1, 2015.In addition, the new version adjusts the bill's language to require that the EPA designate chemicals as high-priority if they've been identified as a \"significant\" health hazard, rather than a \"high hazard,\" as designated in the original legislation. It also requires expedited action on chemicals that have already been identified as hazardous and allows citizen lawsuits to challenge the EPA's determination that a chemical is a low priority.But these changes did not go far enough for the legislation's critics in the committee, most vocal among them Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). \"We got rid of a horrible bill,\" said Boxer, referring to the older version of the Vitter-Udall legislation. \"We have a bill that makes progress. We will continue to work on it until it really protects the people who are hurting.\"Boxer criticized the bill for not imposing strong enough deadlines for regulating chemicals, and for continuing to exempt states from setting standards for chemicals if the federal EPA is considering action on them.The California Democrat offered a handful of amendments in committee that failed to get enough votes to pass, but said she has a list of 27 amendments to offer as the bill moves forward. \"If this gets to the floor, you'll hear all of them,\" she said.Environmental and public health groups are also calling for additional changes. Daniel Rosenberg, a senior attorney in the health and environment program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the changes an \"important step forward\" but criticized the committee for rejecting several amendments that the group said would have addressed additional concerns.Vitter's office said they expect the bill to go before the full Senate in the coming weeks."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - April 28, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Devastation and rescue in Nepal after massive earthquake; March 2015 the hottest March on record; Sardines crash in the Pacific; PLUS: Fighting climate change with the power of poo...

The high levels have also contributed to large explosions like the one seen in the video above.\"Magma is rising up into the lava lake from a magma chamber a mile or so beneath the summit of Kilauea volcano,\" research geologist Matthew Patrick told The Huffington Post. According to Patrick, Kilauea has been consistently inflating for the past week, meaning that magma keeps flowing into the lake from an underground chamber below.The overflows pose no safety threats since the lava is staying within Halemaumau Crater, where the lava lake sits. But visitors to Volcanoes National Park are getting quite a display.Typically, the lava surface is 100 to 200 feet below the rim of the crater lake and therefore can't be seen from the public viewing area around the volcano. Since the lava has risen, Patrick said, \"its incandescent cracks and often vigorous spattering\" can easily be seen from the overlook.While this is a notable development in the current eruption, it's not particularly unusual in the history of Kilauea, Patrick said. \"In the 1800s and early 1900s, there was nearly continuous lava lake activity for about 100 years, and oftentimes that lava was spilling out of Halemaumau Crater,\" he explained.As exciting as the overflow is, it is possible Kilauea will abruptly deflate, Patrick said, bringing the lava's surface back down to typical levels.In the meantime, we can all enjoy a better view into the lava lake:This piece is being updated continuously as new information becomes available."}, {"title": "Pebble Mine: Down to Lawyers, Lobbyists and Legislators", "text": "Pebble Mine is not grabbing headlines these days, but the battle to protect Bristol Bay is far from over. In contrast to the significant headlines and victories in 2014 -- Rio Tinto withdrawing from the project; EPA proposing specific restrictions on the development of Pebble Mine; Alaska voters passing an initiative aimed at protecting the Bristol Bay watershed from large-scale mining, which is harmful to Alaska's wild salmon; and President Obama declaring Bristol Bay off-limits to oil and gas drilling -- 2015 has been deceptively quiet.Photo credit: Robert Glenn KetchumAll the major investors -- Mitsubishi, Anglo American, and Rio Tinto -- have fled the project, taking massive losses to walk away from Bristol Bay, and Pebble has been unable to find another moneyed partner to advance the project. This leaves junior mining company Northern Dynasty Minerals, now the sole owner of the project, with a serious cash-flow problem. But the company hasn't given up on its dreams to build a colossal mine at the headwaters of the world's greatest wild salmon fishery. Last January, with the sale of special warrants to existing investors, it raised about $15 million -- almost half of which came from a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands.Where is the money going? Not to mining but to lawyers and lobbyists. According to a prospectus filed with Canadian securities regulators, Northern Dynasty Minerals plans to use that money to advance a \"multi-dimensional strategy to address the EPA's pre-emptive regulatory process under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act ... includ[ing] three discrete pieces of litigation against the EPA ... as well as facilitation of various third-party investigations of EPA actions with respect to the Pebble Project.\"Yep, like a terminal patient on life support, Pebble Mine is all about \"staying alive\" -- which translates into the nicely alliterative trio of lawyers, lobbyists and legislators.Lawyers. Pebble filed three lawsuits against EPA, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes. The first suit, alleging violations of Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, was dismissed last year. Not surprisingly, Pebble immediately filed an appeal, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on May 14 in Anchorage, Alaska. The second suit, alleging violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, resulted in a limited preliminary injunction that bars EPA from proceeding under 404(c) until after the judge considers the case. That could happen as early as May 28, when a federal judge in the District Court of Alaska will hear arguments to determine whether the case will move forward or be dismissed, freeing EPA to continue its work. The third suit, alleging violations of the Freedom of Information Act, is still pending.Lobbyists. Pebble hired two Washington, D.C., consulting firms to \"conduct an independent review\" of EPA's work on the proposed mine. This \"independent\" review being undertaken by the Cohen Group and the law firm DLA Piper will \"focus on the fairness of EPA's actions\" and \"will follow the evidence wherever it might lead ... as fairly and thoroughly as possible.\" However, this \"independent\" review has been initiated and funded by the very company whose economic existence depends on stopping EPA and building the Pebble Mine. The very same company that has attacked EPA for years, claiming its science is bunk and its process unfair. And the very same company that has repeatedly ignored the residents of Bristol Bay, who overwhelming oppose the Pebble Mine and support EPA's decision to place restrictions on the mine.Legislators. Both the House and Senate introduced legislation that would strip EPA's ability under the Clean Water Act to stop Pebble. U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana) and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) introduced a bill in the Senate that would gut EPA's authority under the Clean Water Act. S. 234 is just another industry giveaway that would block EPA from doing its job. Like the companion House bill, it's aimed at straitjacketing EPA and greenlighting the Pebble Mine.With the legal and legislative battles intensifying, NRDC is fighting back both in the court room and on Capitol Hill. We are defending EPA in court. We are also working to defeat the Senate and House bills as well as any appropriation riders attached to the budget process that would defund EPA's review of the Pebble project. Finally, we continue to urge EPA to use its authority under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to stop the Pebble Mine -- as soon as it is legally possible.Please help us keep up the pressure to stop the Pebble Mine!"}, {"title": "After Years Apart, Elephant Mom And Calf Rediscover The Love Of Family", "text": "It's said that an elephant never forgets, and for a mother elephant and her cherished calf who were reunited earlier this month after years apart, it's clear they remember their early love for each other.Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "SuperTrucks: Clean, Efficient and Long Overdue", "text": "The idea that big tractor-trailer trucks could be overlooked might seem ludicrous when you're trying to merge onto a freeway with one bearing down on you at 70 miles per hour. But when it comes to energy efficiency and fuel economy -- that is to say, when it comes to CO2 emissions and climate change -- trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles have indeed been mostly overlooked so far. That's a problem -- and an opportunity.There's been a lot of attention paid to passenger-vehicle efficiency, and with good reason. In the U.S., passenger vehicles account for roughly 60% of greenhouse-gas emissions in the transportation sector, and more than 115 billion gallons of annual fuel consumption. Whether you're most concerned with energy security or global warming, driving those numbers down makes sense. Globally, the story's much the same. Roughly 80% of all new passenger-vehicle sales worldwide now happen in markets regulated by fuel-efficiency standards. And without exception, those standards -- in North America, Europe, China, Japan and elsewhere -- get tighter every year.That kind of attention pays off. In the U.S., average passenger-car fuel economy will roughly double by 2025, the last year of the current CAFE standards. Consider this: we're on track to actually reverse the trend of annual increases in CO2 emissions from the global passenger-vehicle fleet that's been in place literally since the invention of the automobile.Meanwhile, though, heavy-duty vehicles have largely avoided this type of regulation. The average \"big rig\" in the U.S. today gets about six mpg diesel, pretty much exactly what it did during the Reagan era. Heavy-duty vehicles are responsible for about one-third of CO2 emissions from the on-road transportation sector in the U.S., and unless things change, that proportion will rise to about half over the next 20 years, as passenger cars get more efficient. In other parts of the world, HDVs account for an even larger proportion of all transportation-GHG emissions, and their share is increasing even faster. All that CO2 represents gallons of fuel burned -- and is paid for by raising the cost of the goods carried on all those trucks.Which brings us to the \"what's working\" part of the story.The U.S. Department of Energy has quietly sponsored a collaborative effort involving all the major truck manufacturers in the U.S. to develop and test new, energy-efficient long-haul tractor-trailers. As part of this \"SuperTruck\" program, Cummins/Peterbilt last year unveiled a prototype tractor-trailer that got 10.7 miles per gallon, and recently Daimler debuted a rival prototype, using a different design and technology, that gets just more than 12 mpg -- that is, double the fuel economy of the average long-haul tractor-trailer today.No, they're not quite ready for mass production, but these are not mere drawing-board vehicles either. Our own research is showing that these technologies could enable tractor-trailers to get more than 10 mpg within the next 5-15 years and offer payback periods of less than 18 months -- well within current industry expectations.The SuperTruck program is an example of collaboration paired with competition, a public-sector/private-sector effort that wouldn't be effective if it didn't involve that cross-sector cooperation, and wouldn't even exist without the DoE's initiative. By any measure, it's been a success in terms of leveraging the best engineering knowledge to develop the technologies for a very fuel-efficient truck.And by itself it isn't enough. The trucking industry is a conservative one, the manufacturers are risk averse, and right now the cost of all that unnecessary fuel consumption is passed on to the consumer in the form of fuel surcharges or simple higher prices for goods. Something else is needed to put SuperTrucks on the road.Which explains why the EPA and NHTSA are about to propose fuel-efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles that will require a steady improvement in average fuel economy for new trucks starting around 2020. To be precise, these will constitute Phase 2 of a regulation first adopted in 2011, which set standards for new HDVs, starting in 2014.While it's impossible to say exactly what standards the agencies will propose, there's every reason to hope that they'll push the envelope very close to what the SuperTruck prototypes have demonstrated are the currently feasible limits of technology and design.The standards are the indispensable complement to the collaborative R&D effort that the SuperTruck program represents. Only three other governments (Canada, Japan and China) have set any type of efficiency standards for trucks, and none have ventured into the same type of public/private cooperation on technology innovation. The U.S. could lead the way by pushing the advanced SuperTruck technologies into the market with a policy nudge. Big economies around the world have a huge opportunity to double the fuel efficiency of one of the largest sources of carbon emissions.

Unlike the 2009 Copenhagen summit, where high hopes were dashed by low politics, this time the world's two biggest polluting countries (the U.S. and China) are onboard.Political leaders will find it harder than ever to avoid their responsibilities.The shameful truth is that the slow response to this urgent issue means some climate change is now inevitable.But we must not waver from the common goal of limiting a global temperature rise to 2 degrees.The United States has committed to reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 levels in 2025. The European Union has put forward a target of 40 percent. And Japan is expected to announce a target of at least 20 percent.Developing nations like Mexico and China have agreed to reduce their emissions after 2026 and 2030, respectively.These announcements are an important benchmark for other countries, including Australia. We have the highest greenhouse emissions per capita in the developed world, and our commitment is crucial to a successful global approach to tackling climate change.Commitments from national governments are the crucial foundation for keeping us below a 2-degree-temperature rise.Cities are where these national commitments will turn from words to action. Cities are economic hubs, driving development, growth and investment. But cities are also causing more than 70 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions.We must improve on the 20th century model of urban sprawl, fossil-fuel consumption and private motor-vehicle transport, or preventing runaway climate change may not be possible.Fortunately, a number of mayors are leading the way, and those who are taking action are seeing the economic and health benefits of investing in sustainable climate solutions.In Sydney, our Sustainable Sydney 2030 long-term plan lays out a vision for becoming a green, global and connected city. We are on track to meet our ambitious greenhouse-gas-reduction target of 70 percent below 2006 levels by 2030.As well as planning for a city driven by clean energy, we are forming profitable partnerships with the private sector to reduce emissions today.Our Better Buildings Partnership with property owners covers more than half of the Sydney CBD's commercial-floor space. The program has reduced emissions in these buildings by 35 percent, putting it ahead of schedule to reach the 70 percent target by 2030. Businesses have also slashed their energy bills by $30 million a year.Our efforts are based on our belief that addressing climate change promotes both growth and livability -- and we are not alone. While national governments have struggled to work together to solve the global-climate crisis, mayors are cooperating through organizations like the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) to deliver concrete results.Sydney will co-chair the C40 Private Sector Buildings Energy Efficiency Network with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. We're hoping to share some of the secrets of our success with them, and other cities.Seoul is reducing their entire city's energy demand by the equivalent output of one nuclear power plant, through energy conservation and the use of renewable-energy sources.By 2020, San Francisco will be diverting 100 percent of its garbage away from landfill, avoiding enormous amounts of greenhouse gases. In 2010, they were already diverting 80 percent away from landfill.These are examples we can all learn from. If Chicago has a great idea, Johannesburg can benefit. If Singapore is taking effective action, Mumbai can gain, too.In 2012, we began to replace our street lights with new LED bulbs. This was an idea we borrowed from Los Angeles, and it has already cut emissions from street light by more than 46 percent.City leaders across the globe are pulling together and pulling their weight.In the coming weeks, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott will decide whether our country is a climate lifter or a climate leaner. The success of global-climate negotiations rests on this kind of decision.The economic consequences of failing to act are serious. Over the past 12 months, investment in the renewable-energy sector in Australia has collapsed because of the Abbott Government's unwillingness to take serious action. This investment is now headed to other cities and regions that support clean energy, while we miss out on a global boom in the industries of the future.If Prime Minister Abbott makes the wrong decision, he will make Australia an international pariah that cowers from its duty to act.The world is now moving, and it is time for Australia to step up. The City of Sydney is ready to support an ambitious target that Australia puts into place, and to lend our full weight to achieve those goals.Clover Moore is Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney. Sydney is one of 75 city members of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which -- along with UN Special Envoy Michael Bloomberg and other city networks -- has launched the Compact of Mayors, the world's largest cooperative effort among cities to fight climate change.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Responsible environmental stewardship is a core American value that should unite us as a nation.That's why we urge every presidential candidate -- Republican, Democrat or independent -- to embrace early on the need for assertive action on the central environmental challenges of our time. Chief among those is our obligation to protect current and future generations from the widening dangers of climate change.Through rising seas, withering drought, catastrophic storms and other hallmarks of climate change, our world is telling us every way it knows how that it's time to cut the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving the climate crisis. Long before history judges our response, voters will decide which candidate best understands the threat we face and the urgency of acting against it.Acting on climate change isn't just good policy; it's also good politics. Recent polling shows two thirds of likely 2016 voters are more likely to vote for a candidate who vows to fight climate change. The public -- including 54 percent of Republicans -- wants us to cut the carbon pollution from our power plants. And by a 2-to-1 margin, voters prefer investing in energy efficiency and renewable power to anchoring our future in the dirty fossil fuels of the past.What the country understands is that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create well-paying jobs, make the nation more secure and create a more healthful future for our children by investing today in clean energy solutions.Some in Congress have turned away from that opportunity by pressing a misguided agenda that puts polluter profits first -- and puts the rest of us at risk. Our next president, whatever his or her party, must reject this big-polluter agenda in favor of the responsible stewardship that the American people expect and deserve.Accordingly, we call on you, as an aspirant to this high office, to commit to cut carbon pollution by at least 28 percent by 2025, and thereafter to achieve even greater reductions as required by sound science. In addition, we call on you to lead a transition to an economy powered by clean, renewable and efficient energy and to demonstrate the global leadership needed to get our partners around the world to do their part to protect the well-being of the planet through strong international agreements. And finally, we call on you to defend and strengthen the fundamental safeguards that protect our air, water, lands, and wildlife.No great nation can afford to wait on the imperatives of its time. Creating the will to act will require the kind of leadership that sets great presidents apart from the rest. The nation awaits that kind of leader, one who is ready to stand up today for the future we'll leave to our children."}, {"title": "Seaweed Might Have The Power To Make The Oceans Less Acidic", "text": "The thick, slimy brown ribbons are notorious for tangling the ankles of beachgoers and rotting in pungent piles. But kelp, according to its growing fan base, could also prove potent in protecting the health of oceans -- and us.\"We've got some bad water heading our way,\" said Betsy Peabody, founder and executive director of the Puget Sound Restoration Fund. In April, Peabody's small organization in Bainbridge Island, Washington, won a $1.5 million grant from the Paul Allen Family Foundation to investigate how cultivating the seaweed might help lessen the impacts of ocean acidification.Other research has hinted at the sea plant's potential to prevent toxic algal blooms and provide habitat for marine life, as well as even generate sustainable energy and food while preserving scarce fresh water for humans.\"Kelp is a game-changer,\" said Bren Smith, owner of the Thimble Island Oyster Co., which grows a vertical farm of oysters, scallops, clams, mussels and kelp in Long Island Sound. \"It is so resilient, fast-growing and does all of these powerful things.\"Smith, too, referenced kelp's capacity to sweeten souring seas.Rising levels of carbon dioxide are not only altering the global climate, but also changing ocean chemistry. A quarter of the greenhouse gas belched by coal and other fossil fuels is soaked up by seas. The result is increasingly acidic water that carries fewer carbonate ions, critical building blocks for the skeletons and shells of many valuable and vulnerable sea animals such as clams, crabs, lobsters, shrimp and sea butterflies.No larger than a grain of sand, the latter snail-like creature is a staple in the diet of marine animals, including sea birds and salmon, around the world. Off the Pacific Northwest coast, about half of sea butterflies carry partially dissolved shells, deformed fins and other impacts of ocean acidification that affect their ability to swim and avoid predators and infections. Researchers project that three-quarters will be affected by 2050. A 10 percent drop in sea butterfly numbers translates into about a 20 percent drop in the body weight of mature salmon.\"Salmon are food for orcas, seals and sea lions. Salmon are food for us,\" said Peabody, adding that sea butterflies are also an indicator of how ocean acidification may impact other species. \"We need to fully understand what is in our tool box and what isn't to mitigate these effects.\"She and other scientists recognize the urgency of the situation. The world's oceans are already 30 percent more acidic than than they were at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, and are predicted to be 150 percent more so by the end of this century. The increasingly corrosive conditions can also kill coral reefs, scramble fish behavior and make many sea creatures less resilient to pollution.The Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, is currently one of the most acidic water bodies in the country. Experts warn that it is also a harbinger of things to come elsewhere, especially along shorelines where more acidic water naturally upwells from the sea floor.With the help of federal, state and university scientists, Peabody and her team are now preparing to deploy three acres of twine seeded with budding sugar kelp in Puget Sound's Hood Canal. Once the array is submerged, they will begin using sensors on boats and buoys to test the acidity of water before it enters the site, and then again as it leaves. They should have results by 2019.Walt Dickhoff, division director at NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center, a member of the grant-funded project team, likened the strategy to creating green spaces in cities. Trees, lawns and seaweeds like kelp all act as natural sinks for carbon dioxide.\"This is the first attempt to actually counteract ocean acidification,\" said Dickhoff, noting that if the pilot project is successful, native kelp species could be enlisted to protect vulnerable coasts around the world. \"As ocean acidification gets worse, which is the direction it is going, can we do something to mitigate it, at least in local places?\"Of course, ocean acidification is a far bigger problem than can be simply solved by rafts of seaweed, warn experts. Cuts to emissions remain critical.\"In the Asia Pacific, a lot [of seaweed] is used in food and is thus simply respired to carbon dioxide in a short time span, so it does not contribute to carbon dioxide mitigation,\" John Beardall, an expert in seaweed and ocean acidification at Monash University in Australia, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. \"However, if converted to biofuel or used to make chemicals that would otherwise be derived from fossil fuels, then we could reduce our fossil fuel consumption and thereby mitigate some of our carbon dioxide problems.\"Dickhoff noted that his team, partially in an effort to make the strategy economically sustainable, will look into harvesting the kelp for products such as food, fertilizer, animal feed and biofuel.Growing kelp could pay off in other ways. Harmful algal blooms, for example, are estimated to cost the U.S. $82 million or more per year. The toxins they release kill fish, cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and contaminate drinking water. But macroalgae, which includes kelp and seagrass, can harbor bacteria that fend off the growth of toxic algae, explained Vera Trainer, program manager of the Marine Biotoxin Group at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. She recently completed a study, not yet published, that found areas of Puget Sound that have generally escaped harmful algal blooms are also rich in seagrass.\"There's chemical warfare out there in the biological world,\" she said, adding that more research needs to be done to determine the relative algae-defeating potential of different types of macroalgae.Seaweeds such as kelp can also absorb nitrogen, which runs into waterways from lawns, farms and septic systems, and feeds algal blooms. Meanwhile, ocean acidification itself has been show to increase the frequency and toxicity of harmful algal blooms, added Jan Newton, an oceanographer at the University of Washington and another member of the team.\"We're trying to turn a negative into a positive,\" she said. \"There could be a lot of benefits coming out of kelp.\"Among those benefits, according to Smith, is also a cheap, healthy and delicious food that is easy to grow and resilient to climate change. He predicts kelp could become the \"new kale.\" (He noted that the kelp farmed to remediate pollution -- including heavy metals -- would not be put into the food system.)\"Kelp requires no feed, no fertilizer, no arid land and no fresh water,\" added Smith, who once caught factory-fished for McDonald's and now calls himself an \"ocean gardener.\"He pointed to the devastating drought in California, where irrigation for land-based agriculture accounts for 80 percent of the state’s water use.“Ocean greens just don’t require it,” he said."}, {"title": "'Cats Doing Cat Stuff For Adoption' Will Make You Want To Adopt A Cat", "text": "Forget kittens with giant sad eyes pleading at the camera.

It also leads to waste of large percentages of energy and the disruption of astronomical research, among a long list of impacts.”Heffernan and Mehmedinovic told The Huffington Post over email that they decided to launch the SKYGLOW Project after realizing just “how widespread and destructive” the problem of skyglow actually is. A natural magic is lost, they said, when the night sky is washed out by artificial light.Mehmedinovic, who grew up in Bosnia but now lives in Flagstaff, Ariz., said he was always “mesmerized” by stars as a child.“When I came to the U.S., and kicked around from city to city, it took me a while to realize I couldn’t see the stars at all,” he said. “It wasn’t until I started doing road trips across the country that I saw them, and had a flashback to early childhood. I was hooked again.”To create the Los Angeles time-lapse video, which has gone viral this week, Heffernan and Mehmedinovic said they painstakingly cut out the city sky in Photoshop, and replaced it with composites of starscapes taken at dark sky preserves such as Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.“SKYGLOW is about re-discovering the incredible resource that is the night sky and learning about ways to protect it,” Heffernan, who is based in L.A., told HuffPost. “We'll be focusing on the stark contrast between the drowned-out polluted skies of urban centers juxtaposed with the amazing starscapes of dark sky preserves.

Since its founding 12 decades ago, WCS - originally the New York Zoological Society (NYZS) - has dedicated itself to the protection of wildlife and wild places, with the exploration of, and advocacy for, marine seascapes being a high-priority.The new marine protected areas are the nation's first. Located along Madagascar's western coast in what is known as the Mozambique Channel, the new parks are home to the world's second-most diverse coral population. Together with the government and local communities, WCS has worked in these three sites over the last five years to develop and establish a new conservation model that uses a community-driven, science-based approach.Madagascar's three new marine protected areas will help to secure the world's second-most diverse coral population. Photo by Jürg Brand.That approach has evolved over the course of more than a century of dedicated conservation action. It was a recognition in the late 19th century that rapid industrialization was quickly depleting valuable natural resources that spurred a fledgling environmental movement. As that movement gained momentum, we saw the creation of the world's first national park at Yellowstone in 1872. Sequoia and Yosemite would soon follow.The New York Zoological Society, established with the committed action of early conservationists (including Theodore Roosevelt, who had come to appreciate the great cost of misusing the natural world during his time as a rancher in the Dakota Territories), took as its first action the creation of a zoological park whose stated purpose would be threefold:1. To encourage an interest in animal life, or zoology, \"amongst all classes of people, and the promotion of zoological science in general.\"2. \"Co-operation with other organizations in the preservation of the native animals of North America, and encouragement of the growing sentiment against their wanton destruction.\"3. To maintain \"collections of North American and exotic animals, for the benefit and enjoyment of the general public, the zoologist, the sportsman, and every lover of nature.\"Of course those collections formed the basis of what became the Bronx Zoo, headquarters for NYZS - and now WCS - and the vehicle through which our organization undertook its first great conservation efforts.In the early 20th century, WCS's Bronx Zoo played a vital role in preventing the extinction of American bison. Photo by Cristián Samper © WCS.Those efforts would notably include the resettlement of some 75 bison from the Bronx to the Western plains of the U.S. over a six-year period in an effort to replenish herds of this magnificent species - North America's largest mammal - that had been reduced from over 30 million animals to roughly 1,000 in the span of just a few decades.With another once-abundant species - the passenger pigeon - on the verge of extinction, new hope arose for humans' capacity to act to save species from the destructive impacts of hunting and the ever-growing loss of wild habitat. At NYZS, the idea that marine species were a part of that mission was never a question.After his successful bison effort, Bronx Zoo founding director William Hornaday moved on to galvanize public opinion around the relentless hunting of the northern fur seal. Effectively working with representatives in the U.S. Congress, Hornaday was able to secure passage of the Fur Seal Treaty of 1911. Bringing an end to ocean-based seal hunting, the treaty was signed by the U.S., Great Britain, Japan, and Russia.In 1934 off the Bermuda coast, NYZS natural and explorer William Beebe completed a record-setting 3,028-foot research dive in the Bathysphere submersible designed by his colleague Otis Barton, who accompanied him. Photo ©WCS.NYZS continued to support the protection and exploration of marine areas in the decades to come. Naturalist, explorer, and founding Bronx Zoo bird curator William Beebe turned his attentions in the 1920s and 30s to exploration of the sea, with oceanographic expeditions to locales as far away as the Galápagos Islands.At his tropical research station in Nonsuch, Bermuda in 1934, Beebe completed a record-setting 3,028-foot dive in the Bathysphere submersible designed by his colleague Otis Barton, who accompanied him. Between 1930-1934, the Bathysphere enabled Beebe and Barton to complete some of the first observations of deep sea ocean animals.Some of the sea creatures seen by William Beebe during his Bathysphere dives of the early 1930s, as rendered by NYZS artist Else Bostelmann. ©WCS.Those efforts were followed in the late 1950s by the creation of the world's first land and sea park at Exuma Cays in the Bahamas through the committed efforts of NYZS's Carleton Ray.The late 1950s likewise saw a move by the New York Aquarium from lower Manhattan's Castle Clinton, where it had been operated by NYZS since 1902, to Coney Island - nestled beside the famous boardwalk just yards from the Atlantic Ocean.The relationship between the aquarium and the regional waters of New York has grown stronger in recent years, with wide-ranging citizen science projects, a dedicated effort to inspire students toward careers in conservation, and - perhaps most exciting - a $250 million expansion in progress that will feature an awe-inspiring 500,000-gallon shark tank and access from the beach.The New York Aquarium engages young people in a variety of programs to inspire them toward careers in science and conservation. Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.Madagascar's three new parks are among some 250 that WCS has helped to establish around the globe since its founding. Madagascar's marine biodiversity supports 10 million people in some of the poorest communities in the world, including over 100,000 artisanal fishers who live near the coast and rely on healthy marine and coastal ecosystems for food, revenue, and livelihoods.It is great to see Madagascar's current government building on the tremendous progress the country achieved in terrestrial protected area creation following the \"Durban Vision\" of 2002 and extending this to the marine realm, where the benefits for biodiversity and human wellbeing are so clear.I can think of no better example than this of why WCS's mission of protecting the world's irreplaceable wildlife heritage remains deeply relevant 120 years after our founding.-------------------------------------------------------- Follow Cristián Samper on Twitter at: @CristianSamper."}, {"title": "Realizing Our Sustainable Energy Future: Making the Participatory Grid a Reality", "text": "Chances are you've recently come across a story heralding solar panels, wind turbines, or energy storage as the solution to preparing our power grid for a low-carbon future. Each of these technologies will move us toward this goal, and we must utilize every opportunity at our disposal to get there.Soon, millions of people will be living in cities that are maintained by renewables and will be charging batteries to both balance those renewables and power activities throughout our everyday lives -- including our daily commute. It's crucial that we start preparing our grid now for what lies ahead, while also fixing some of today's biggest issues. Finding a truly sustainable solution means looking beyond just one potential \"magic bullet\" answer to considering the energy landscape from a bird's eye view.Understanding the Grid and Why It Needs to ChangeThe grid is constantly being subjected to spikes in energy usage and is structured to accommodate our worst-case maximum demands. This is typically during the hottest days of summer when air conditioners cities-wide go on full blast and energy consumption is at its max. Summer brownouts and blackouts are a significant risk during these high levels of consumption that can push many grids to their limit or beyond.Often, renewables such as solar are at their highest output during these times, but this generation isn't guaranteed due to what is called \"intermittency,\" whereby generation drops unexpectedly. When this happens, traditional generation would be required to ramp up to compensate and maintain quality of supply. The problem: Carbon-based power plants cannot ramp up quickly enough to cover the shortfall. An extreme example of this is when a renewable generator goes from 100 percent output to 0 percent output in a matter of minutes, but large-scale generators can only change load by a small percentage per hour. This leaves a difficult gap to fill.Traditionally, utilities have turned to \"peaker plants\" to supplement supply at a premium cost since they spend large parts of the year, or even multiple years, in idle. This is a poorly utilized asset that utilities, business owners, tenants, rate payers and consumers are paying for. Chemical battery storage has been seen as the savior to the intermittency problem and an alternative to peaking generators. Battery costs have continued to fall and will no doubt be a critical part of the future smart grid. However, we need to consider a range of other mechanisms that may allow us to speed the transition and reduce costs even further.The Energy You Don't UseThe cheapest energy is the energy you don't use in the first place. Taking a look around a modern office, we see one of the biggest impacts and contributors to modern energy savings -- LEDs. LEDs in our lighting and computer monitors have made a sizable impact on efficiency. The next step is to implement the next level of savings by finding faults, installing efficient appliances and a range of other measures.It is interesting that despite our efforts to reduce waste, improve efficiency and introduce more renewables to the grid, the need for energy storage persists.Energy Storage by Many MeansEnergy storage has become a hot topic usually mentioned in conjunction with renewables. While batteries are the most discussed type of building-level storage, they are expensive and might not be the right fit for every building or region.Chilled and hot water thermal storage tanks, compressed air storage, and ice banks represent viable and affordable alternatives to battery power. These can be installed for significantly less than a battery, cost less per kWh and can easily have more than double the lifespan. Consider that 1,000 liters of water can store around 10kWh of energy at practically no cost, whereas a battery of similar size can cost more than $10,000 once fully installed.By storing energy in the medium which it is used, such as ice for cooling, these systems offer better round-trip efficiency -- a measure of the amount of energy lost between charge and discharge -- than battery storage, which is around 75 percent. However, before buildings start implementing storage, they should be aware of the storage they already have.Let Your Building Do the WorkIt may be surprising, but the building itself can be treated as a storage device. When efficiently utilized, a building's infrastructure -- all bricks, concrete, steel and wood -- can serve as a resource. A building's mass can trap cooling and heating, keeping a building comfortable during interruptions to renewable output.Intelligent energy management systems can help with this by making automatic adjustments to operations based on a building's characteristics and other real-time conditions so buildings run at optimal efficiency. These systems take into account typical energy usage patterns and other variables such as signals from the utility, weather forecasts and occupant comfort to make adjustments to heating and cooling operations that generate huge savings. By using artificial intelligence, the software is able to map out a path to savings that would otherwise not be possible.This technology is more than just a logic-based, pre-determined-response set up. It is able to understand the situation the building and grid are facing and make changes that are beneficial 10-15 moves into the future instead of making changes for instant gratification that could void a future opportunity.Integrating For a Sustainable FutureIt's this type of intelligence that needs to be in place before adding other systems to a building and the grid to ensure that all platforms work in harmony with each other. Buildings that can control lighting, HVAC and storage through a unified system will benefit the overall grid by making sure that technologies aren't working against each other.What is happening within the building is a microcosm of what should also be happening within the entire grid. Every building will need to work together in the future. What's efficient for one building in the moment might not be best for the grid in the long-term. With a connected system in place, buildings will be able to see the complete energy landscape in its entirety and make decisions that will benefit itself as well as the greater good of the grid.Looking to the FutureAccording to IHS Automotive, worldwide production of EVs will increase by 67 percent this year. The charging of these vehicles adds yet another variable to how energy loads should be shaped within buildings. If everyone plans on charging their cars during the work day, this could cause an even higher peak demand. If we all charge in the morning, it could add a new peak to our grid. We need to plan for this eventuality.Our energy future is poised to become unprecedentedly complex with this widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), further integration of renewable energy sources and more. Having intelligent software in place that can serve as a central point for all energy decisions within a building will make adaption to future changes easier. EVs will become just another variable. The same principle applies to renewable energy. By looking at weather patterns, it knows when solar will be producing less and can make adjustments before the drop-off in generation happens.This complex symphony conducted by artificially intelligent systems will usher in a new era of smart cites. These self-sufficient, grid-responsive networks created within buildings, between buildings and in collaboration with the utility they work with, will ensure consistent energy usage, stable demand, a thriving electric grid, and most importantly, an attainable, sustainable future."}, {"title": "A New Generation of Change-Makers", "text": "Young people are currently living in a world of infinite wonder. With the rapid advancement and proliferation of technology across all sectors of life, from health to productivity, there seems to be no limit to this endless evolution. As the confines of the human mind continue to be tested and stretched into infinity, we seem to have found comfort in our ability to confront and overcome obstacles we face as a species. In this new era of hope and progress, we have found ourselves facing a new and novel challenge that we have not yet experienced: climate change. The question then becomes, how do we fix this?The past conversations surrounding climate change have been focused too much on whether it is anthropogenic or natural. While the evidence is clear on its human origin, the reality is that our climate is changing and that we need to act in response to these shifting conditions. Even my own state of Nebraska is not exempt from the impacts of climate change. A report published in 2014 by the University of Nebraska shared that the state experienced an overall warming of about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1895, and the projected temperature changes will range from an increase of 4-5 degrees or 8-9 degrees, depending on the emission scenarios, by the last quarter of the 21 century. Changes in precipitation from climate change will \"impact runoff and groundwater recharge, affect the types of crops that can be grown, influence water pollution, alter the occurrence of flooding and drought, and determine the type and health of ecosystems.\" We are also warned that \"changes in the observed frequency and intensity of extreme events are of serious concern today and for the future because of the economic, social and environmental costs associated with responding to, recovering from, and preparing for these extreme events in the near and longer term.\"Here in Nebraska, both the young and older generations are working to promote sustainability in diverse ways. The City of Lincoln has recently received a $600,000 federal grant, through the Nebraska Department of Roads, to start a bike sharing program. This program began as an initiative led by University of Nebraska-Lincoln student, Reed Broderson, before it was handed over to the City. To the northeast corner of the state, the City of Tilden recently received a $3.6 million grant from USDA Rural Development for its water and waste water systems, which will introduce the installation of water meters. These water meters will help users monitor their usage in order to save and conserve. Despite its strong dedication to sustainability, Nebraska has a long way to go. For instance, while Nebraska has the 4 largest wind resources in the country, it does not rank in the top 20 for wind energy production. Nonetheless, Nebraska was expected to triple its wind energy potential in 2015, so slowly but surely, the state will improve.As a global collective, young people are placed in a peculiar and difficult position. Young people have both special concerns and responsibilities as it relates to the longevity of this planet, one that is currently being tested by climate change. Like all previous generations, they are going to be tasked with the monumental challenge of overcoming the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution, as well as the current and continuing industrial and land use trends. Climate change is no longer a myth or conspiracy, but a cruel reality which we must now face. My generation and future generations will have to live longer with the consequences of current patterns and be subject to their impacts. Nonetheless, we must never forsake our potential to improve and change the world, and we can do this by first changing ourselves and our habits.From my experience, the keys to solving sustainability issues are accountability and ownership. While the depth of the current problem was caused by previous generations, it does not mean that my generation and those of the future are completely free of blame. This new era of instant gratification has led to high consumption patterns, fueled by desire to get the latest brand products or technology. That being said, young people have a two-front battle. They must first work collectively to fix problems of the past, as well as of their own habits. Only by starting early can the youth population create a culture of conscientiousness and respect for the earth. We need a new generation of everyday change-makers, and we need them now.This blog post is part of the 'It's Our Earth (Day)' blog series, curated by the editors of HuffPost Generation Change in recognition of Earth Day 2015.

Slicing open the box — which was soaking wet and labeled \"stuff animals\" — they discovered three puppies, \"overheated and covered in urine,\" Jamie McAloon, the director of McKamey Animal Center in Chattanooga, told The Dodo. \"If they'd been there much longer, they would have perished.\"Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "Diver Swims Through Massive 'Silver Rush' Of Fish", "text": "We're well aware that the ocean is an extraordinary and mysterious place, but for William Mitchell, a scuba diver from London, one particular plunge in Grand Cayman turned into a once-in-a-lifetime experience.In July 2013, Mitchell was diving in the Devil's Grotto, an undersea cavern, when he encountered a massive cloud of Atlantic silversides -- a phenomenon known in the dive community as a \"silver rush.\"His footage, which was recently re-edited and posted by GoPro, shows what Mitchell described as \"a wall of solid silver.\" A ton of fish dart around him in incredible harmony, and the dense school parts in sync to make way for him.Mitchell, now 24, said that the experience was nothing short of amazing. \"It is very difficult to put into words how it felt diving with all those tiny fish,\" he told The Huffington Post.It's understandable -- swimming through an underwater ballet of liquid silver seems to warrant speechlessness."}, {"title": "Are City Folks the New Caretakers of the Land?", "text": "In a beautifully written article in The Atlantic, writer and environmental activist Wendell Berry recently lamented the loss of walking. Not walking as we might think, but farmers walking and getting to know their land, crops walking or being harvested slowly off the land, and water walking rather than rushing off farmland. Berry's assertion is that the loss of these kinds of walking means farmers no longer care for their land as they once did. It means that nature's biological diversity is plowed under monocultures of corn and soybeans, while rich soils are washed away into ditches and streams. As they are replaced by machines, farmers are no longer country people who care for and understand the land according to Berry, but instead become \"city people, industrial workers and consumers, living in the country.\" They join the ranks of humans who destroy nature.Yet what about the other city people? The industrial and service workers, the teachers, the consumers, the retirees, and the children who actually live in cities? Recognizing that the majority of us live in cities, is it possible to find a modern day, urban rendition of farmers walking, crops walking, and water walking off the land? One place to look might be in the community gardens of New York, New Orleans, Berlin and Barcelona, as well as Montreal, Cape Town and thousands of other cities around the world. The city people who walk these small patches of earth amidst high rises, dilapidated houses and rusting factories just might be the rightful successors to the farmers we once knew.In the old days, farmers touched the soil. They became intimate with that soil -- felt its richness and came to understand how it could best grow crops. In today's cities, community gardeners come to know the soil when they use their hands to mix compost with dirt, and their arms to fill raised beds with the soil they have created. Rather than machine harvesting vast monocultures of corn and soybeans, these modern day caretakers of the land harvest a rich mosaic of vegetables and herbs throughout the summer. Like Berry's pre-industrial farmers, they allow their crops to walk off the land. And the community gardens, along with artificial wetlands, pocket parks, and other green infrastructure created by urban land stewards, allow the water running off streets to slow to a walk as it seeps into soils and is taken up by plants, possibly reducing its load of contaminants before entering the river or sea.Youth from the community organization Rocking the Boat work with ecological artist Lillian Ball to plant an artificial wetland along the Bronx River. Photo credit: Adam Green/Joaquin Cotten, Rocking the BoatBerry also laments how scientists at agricultural colleges have been complicit in the demise of walking. Yet a growing number of scientists are supporting the work of walking the land in cities. Cornell PhD student Megan Gregory has spent hundreds of hours speaking with community gardeners in New York City. They told her that their biggest concern is about dirt -- how they can make their soils hold onto water and supply nutrients for their crops. Unlike scientists who are myopically focused on increasing crop yield and blind to any environmental or social consequences, Gregory and her PhD advisor Laurie Drinkwater worked with community gardeners to conduct experiments with cover crops that would enhance soil quality without chemical inputs. Gregory and the community gardeners walk the small plots of land seeking to understand soil fertility in harsh urban environments.Even with the support of scientists like Gregory and Drinkwater, we will not be getting vast quantities of our food from community gardens any time soon. Their importance lies elsewhere. Community gardeners and their scientist partners represent a modern-day version of an agriculture that connects humans with the soil and humans with one another. Community gardeners are often recent immigrants from farmlands-country people who become city people. Yet city people who recreate the connections to land and to neighbors that country people once enjoyed.Community gardeners in New York City examining roots of crimson clover cover crop. Photo credit: Megan GregoryCommunity gardeners represent the start of a larger movement that my colleague Keith Tidball and I have documented in our recent book Civic Ecology: Adaptation and Transformation from the Ground Up. Civic ecology is about how and why people in cities are restoring their places and their communities. Not just community gardeners, but also people who are removing invasive species from local parks, cleaning tombstones and pruning unruly shrubs in cemeteries, planting street trees, picking up litter, and creating artificial reefs to bring back oysters in polluted estuaries. Like Berry's farmers, these urban stewards care for nature and their communities. Their presence turns our paradigm of humans as destroyers of nature on its head -- by showing how people can be a positive force in restoring places and civic life.Community gardeners, oyster gardeners, and other urban land stewards are city people who care for the land and the water. And scientists are increasingly engaging with these urban pioneers to expand their practices in a way that sustains walking in its multiple forms. While I support Berry's calls for walking in our nation's heartland, most of us live in cities. It's time to support the opportunities that the vast majority of us have for walking -- for connecting to and caring for nature and community -- in today's urban world."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Forget Flaring, Solar Light Bulbs, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.Imagine This Looking Like Arizona: a new study suggests climate change could dramatically dry out Yellowstone Park.

While it's common for climate contrarians to repeat myths, despite being corrected, Smith's column is notable for its use of particularly old arguments. For example, his criticisms focus on the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which came out in 2008, even though the IPCC released its Fifth Assessment Report in 2013.Though recently the Wall Street Journal has been running more policy-focused op-eds (that also need correction), this piece demonstrates that while the rest of the world has accepted the reality of human-made climate change, there are those who remain in denial. Representative Smith should know better than to rely on outdated science, as his position as chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology suggests he should be up-to-date on the latest research.His op-ed is a collection of debunked claims, so we'll look at his main points:Overall, this piece shows that climate contrarians are severely lacking in scientific support for their resistance to regulations. At this point, the overwhelming body of credible science doesn't support their contention, so they have to dig up talking points from years past. While the science marches on with increasing certainty, contrarians are struggling to remain relevant. As a result, expired arguments are served up, with the hopes that no one will know they've since been discarded by the scientific community."}, {"title": "Louisiana Storm Blows Train Cars Off Bridge (PHOTOS)", "text": "Several cars were blown off the Huey P.

The area is roughly 10 miles east of New Orleans.National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Hill confirmed to The Huffington Post Monday afternoon that no injuries were reported from the bridge incident or elsewhere in the area.\"A lot of storms came through really fast, upwards of 50 to 60 miles per hour and strong, straight-line winds upwards of 70 miles per hour within those storms,\" Hill said of the storm system, known by meteorologists as a mesoscale convective complex.Thousands of buildings in Jefferson Parish were without power as of 1:30 p.m., WWL-TV reported.

Big things are happening just off the shore of that little island. That's where Deepwater Wind has started construction on America's first-ever offshore wind project.This project will provide 30 megawatts (MW) of power -- enough to provide clean energy to every Block Island resident -- while cutting electric bills by 40 percent. Thanks to this new wind farm, the current polluting diesel generators that power the island, which burn 1 million gallons of diesel annually, will be coming offline, the equivalent of removing 150,000 cars worth of carbon emissions from the roads. Switching from dirty fuels to clean energy means cleaner air and water for Rhode Island families. Even better, excess power will flow back onto the grid in the Northeast via an undersea cable that Deepwater is installing.In 2013, Sierra Club stood side by side with labor and environmental groups including LiUNA, Audubon, and the National Wildlife Federation to turn folks out to a number of hearings in support of the project. Today, we can congratulate our allies and Deepwater Wind on making that hard work a real clean energy success story.The Block Island Wind Farm project is just the beginning of a burgeoning offshore wind industry in the United States. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has designated a wind management area off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts that has the potential to generate as much as 9,000 MW of clean wind power. If we are able to harness that wind, it means power for 700,000 homes and 43,000 offshore wind-related jobs on the East Coast by 2030.That means that 700,000 families could get their electricity from homegrown New England power. And New England isn't alone; up and down the Atlantic coast, from New Jersey and New York to Delaware and Virginia, the clean energy industry is making plans to develop offshore wind power. Investing in clean, safe, renewable offshore wind will power our region and allow us to reap the economic benefits for years to come while providing well-paying jobs that stay right here in our communities.Today's groundbreaking in Rhode Island is the next in a long line of clean energy successes that underscore a real truth about America's energy future: that renewable energy is ready to go and here to stay. The change in America's energy outlook over the last five years has been dramatic: Coal power is on the decline, now less than 40 percent of our energy mix, and continuing to fall. Over the last five years, 188 coal-fired power plants have retired or announced that they will retire. At the same time, clean energy sources like wind and solar are have been on the rise and are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many places. Wind energy now powers 18 million American homes, while solar power keeps the lights on in 3.5 million more.Moving beyond coal means more than just phasing out coal-fired power; it means investing in America's true clean energy promise. Today, on Block Island, we again prove that America can be a leader in creating a clean energy reality that ensures that every person has the right to breathe clean air, enjoy clean water and live in a world free from the threat of climate disruption."}, {"title": "Remembering the Purpose of Earth Day", "text": "I celebrated the 45th Earth Day with the Pacifica Beach Coalition, a group that collects trash and restores habitat.Forty-five years ago, rivers were on fire because of industrial pollution. Today our entire planet is on fire because of carbon pollution. 2014 was the hottest year on record. Temperatures over land and ocean surfaces were the highest since scientists started recording them in 1880. Strange weather has made headlines around the world. We've seen polar vortices and tornadoes in the Midwest, massive snowstorms on the East Coast, rapidly shrinking sea ice at the North and South poles, record hurricanes and cyclones over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, flooding in Asia, and extreme droughts in Africa and right here in the western states of the U.S. Scientists call this the \"new normal\" -- in a warming world we have to expect the unexpected.But even in California, where we are used to a dry climate, we didn't expect four consecutive years of exceptional drought. Just a few weeks ago, on April 1, Governor Jerry Brown announced the lowest snowpack on record in California. He stood on a brown meadow in the Sierras instead of in five feet of snow.Forty-five years ago, people were sick and dying from air and water pollution. They were fed up. Millions of protesters took to the streets to express their appreciation of the planet and demand its protection. One of the co-founders of Earth Day, then-Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey, says the movement resulted in the defeat of corrupt politicians and spurred a quarter-century of bipartisan environmental legislation.In 1970, industrialization was at its height. Garbage was dumped into rivers and bays, sewage flowed straight into the ocean, and toxic chemicals from factories and leaded gasoline exhaust from cars were fouling the air. The Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it caught on fire. Off the Santa Barbara coast one of the worst oil spills soiled miles of coastline and killed thousands of birds and fish.Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin had witnessed the Santa Barbara oil spill and came up with the idea to combine the energy of the anti-Vietnam-War movement with public awareness about pollution in order to put environmental protection on the political agenda. He turned to Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey, who represented the San Francisco Peninsula, and to Denis Hayes, a young Stanford graduate and activist, to create a national teach-in on the environment. Hayes built up a large staff across the country and worked with thousands of universities, colleges and schools to promote the event. On April 22, 1970, 20 million Americans marched in the streets to protest against environmental ignorance and pollution.The mood in the country was ripe for environmental protection and regulations. In the 1970 election, seven of 12 members of Congress with dismal environmental policy records, dubbed the \"Dirty Dozen\" by the Earth Day movement, lost their seats. Landmark environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and Estuary Protection Act, were signed by the Republican president, Richard Nixon.Unfortunately, since the mid '90s, many members of Congress have spent their energy trying to tear down these protections. Right now, one of the big environmental fights in Washington is over whether water runs downhill, a blatant attempt to weaken the Clean Water Act. We must find a way to reignite bipartisan action to ensure that everyone has access to clean water, clean air and a livable environment.For two decades we have failed to create an international treaty on climate change mitigation. In 1997, the U.S., one of the top two polluters in the world, didn't sign on to the Kyoto Protocol. Summits in Rio and Copenhagen ended with basically nothing. This year leaders from around the world will meet in Paris to negotiate an agreement that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a level scientists say is necessary to avert the worst effects of climate change.We see the effects of climate change in California as we confront an ironic pair of threats: drought and flooding. The governor has mandated a 25-percent cut in water use on land because of the drought, yet we are surrounded by ocean water that will flood our land if we don't prepare for sea level rise. San Francisco and San Mateo counties, both of which I represent, are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. The Bay has risen eight inches over the last century, and scientists expect it to rise at least another foot and a half by 2050. If we don't act, portions of Highway 101 and Silicon Valley will end up underwater. I've worked closely with state and local officials to coordinate a response to this threat and am pleased that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Coastal Conservancy are supporting our efforts. Collaboration and planning are essential to prepare for the future.Sea level rise, ocean acidification, species extinctions, erratic weather events, decreased agricultural yields, harm to human health and lower worker productivity are real and costly consequences of climate change. It is past time that we reclaim the spirit of the original Earth Day and make 2015 a year of bipartisan action to preserve our natural resources and the health of our planet. We owe it to future generations."}, {"title": "New Course at the U. of Utah has Students 'Begging' for Change", "text": "Photo by Wendy WischerPanhandling took a different form in downtown Salt Lake City this past Earth Day when students from the University of Utah's Art, Action and the Environment class took to the streets.

What these students were begging for is cleaner air and water and suggesting nature be a prescription for healing.The project was entitled, \"Rethink, Reconnect, Rejuvenate\" and was the collaborative effort of five undergraduate honors students from various disciplines across campus including mechanical engineering, art, business and parks and recreation.In addition to the cardboard photographs, they had smaller replicas printed as postcards that provided passersby with the image on one side and a link to the group's website, where visitors can find additional information on the project, links to sites with more in-depth information, maps of the city's parks, the watershed in the Wasatch range, and even links to local nonprofit organizations working to better the environment.\"With this project, the students have entered the difficult-to-define practice of socially engaged art,\" said Department of Art & Art History Assistant Professor Wendy Wischer who created the course and led this semester-long project with the help of teaching assistant Justin Watson. \"Their goal was to create a meaningful art experience that promoted social change with locally-specific environmental issues and active engagement with the local community. The intention is to use the limitless nature of art to promote creative learning and new ways of discovering solutions.\"And, after hundreds of hours of research, planning, coordination and anticipation, the students left the classroom and went out into the world. As beggars for change.\"When I signed up for the course because it fulfilled a fine arts requirement,\" said Sloan Russell, who studies business marketing and Portuguese. \"I never imagined it would have such a powerful impact on me.\"Russell had two realizations during the process. The first was that art making is a far more complex, challenging and thoughtful endeavor than he (sheepishly) thought it was. The second was that he has a deep passion for environmental protection. So much so, that he's reevaluated and rethought some of his future business ideas to have a significantly reduced impact on the planet.But he wasn't the only student so moved by this experience. Jacob Hopkins, a mechanical engineering student in the course described a sort of revitalization of the creative part of his brain.\"At first, I'd leave class with the right side of my brain hurting,\" Hopkins joked. \"For me, most of my days are spent thinking mathematically and logically -- someone has written a recipe, and I'm going follow it. But this class has re-exposed me to a way of thinking that will be helpful not only in my schooling, but in my future career.\"He's right. Some engineers may always follow the \"recipes,\" but some must also be able to create them.It is hard to anticipate what an experience like this would be like until a person has done it, and there were some parts of it that were both frustrating and sad. The students were surprised by how often they were simply ignored -- sometimes because people seemed more connected to whatever was streaming into their ear buds than anything else, and others who would go to great lengths to avoid eye contact.\"I was sitting at a busy Trax station, and it was interesting to see how many people walking off the train would purposefully look away,\" said Sabrina Stein who is studying parks, recreation and tourism. \"But those who were on the train and safely behind the glass would stare, even as the train pulled away.\"That degradation wasn't something for which they had planned. Although, neither was some people's genuine care and concern. When Hopkins was stationed on campus, he began to attract a growing number of students who ended up engaging in nearly 30-minute conversation about the ways they could change the world.For Janey Heyman, who's dedicated her education to environmental and sustainability studies, this was a very affirming exercise. Connecting with students on campus and people in the community was all in a day's work for her.\"This reinforced the reason for my major,\" she said. \"But it changed how I think about art. I hate to say that I must have believed the stereotypes about artists, but, believe me, I now have a deep respect for them.\"The transformation for photography student Kelly O'Neill was more nuanced. He described how he felt in nature when he'd go camping with his family in southern Utah when he was young. That, he said, was enjoyment, and he contrasted that having a respect for nature.\"It's something not just to be exploited for our enjoyment,\" he said. \"We have to appreciate and preserve it -- something I'm now obsessed with doing!\"Perhaps not all of the students will leave the class with a new obsession, but all will leave changed, whether as more conscientious inhabitants of this world, deeper appreciators of the arts, more creative professionals, or masters of the sometimes dreaded group project.\"They respected each other, they liked each other, they pulled their own weight, and they valued each other's opinions,\" Assistant Professor Wischer said, reflecting on the process in its entirety. \"It was perhaps one of the most successful student collaborations I've ever witnessed.\"Fore more information and a photo gallery, please visit ecoart.art.utah.edu."}, {"title": "Taking a New Look at Hydropower", "text": "Climate change is happening - and we are (largely) done denying it. President Obama enforced this in his 2015 State of the Union address, stating that \"no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.\" Despite lawmakers in the state of Florida burying their heads in the sand to avoid it, the ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising. At this point, we are completely reliant on our abuse of natural resources, and disentangling our lifestyles and industries from environmental damage is not on the immediate horizon. But now, in 2015, we can finally envision a world where we will no longer have to rely on energy sources that damage the environment.In the U.S., coal, natural gas, and crude oil are the leaders in energy production. There is good news in all these sectors this year - \"clean coal\" has been developed to contain carbon emissions, natural gas in shale fracking is allowing reshoring of our energy supplies, and crude oil imports have, for the first time in decades, dropped below domestic production levels. These changes are definitely making progress in the right direction environmentally, economically, and politically, but the hard facts show that even with this progress, these industries are still hazardous and are having a negative impact on the environment. According to the World Economic Forum, approximately 89% of energy in non-renewable resources such as gas, coal, and oil is lost between production and final use.Such a strong emphasis on reducing carbon emissions has highlighted hydropower and nuclear power as ideal solutions in energy production. Even though both dam-building and nuclear fission are friendly to lowering carbon emissions, they are now coming under scrutiny due to the litany of other threats they cause. Damming misses the mark for sustainability due to long-term environmental impacts of controlling and redirecting the natural flow of waterways. Dams are highly damaging to ecological systems, negatively impact downstream populations, and are extraordinarily expensive to build and maintain. Nuclear energy produces massive amounts of hazardous runoff that have to be stored in metal and concrete. Both dams and nuclear power plants pose significant risk to surrounding populations because they are vulnerable to catastrophic failure.The continuing reliance on dams for hydropower fails to take advantage of modern technologies that have higher capacity to yield more efficient energy. Interestingly, there has been a recent trend of decommissioning dams globally, creating a need for viable alternatives in hydropower to replace them (World Commission on Dams 2000). Emerging technologies in hydropower are far more efficient. The key to making hydropower compatible with climate change is embracing these new technologies that eliminate both damage to the environment and negative impacts on downstream populations. This more efficient technology yields higher energy output, while eliminating pollutants caused by other forms of energy derivation. If these technologies are not invested in, the demand for energy will be forced to return to a reliance on non-renewable resources. Eventually, our domestic oil wells will run dry, and our accessible coal lines will be exhausted. If we take a long-range view of energy production, the urgency of developing renewable energy sources becomes more evident.What about areas in drought? Arid regions would previously have been poor candidates for hydropower. However, with new technology available, such as in-pipe turbines, energy is generated by the water flowing through the pipes. If the water has to flow through the pipes anyway, this technology takes advantage of the flow to capture the energy. In regions with rivers flowing year-round, in-river turbines capture the energy of the water's flow without disrupting the local and downstream ecological balance.Some criticize that the environmental movement is losing momentum with the U.S. opting out of the Kyoto Protocol - the most comprehensive attempt toward global climate change to date. However, there are signs that progress is being made in this regard outside of the formal international structures. Influence may be coming from an unlikely contributor in the insurance industry, which some experts say has the \"potential to influence future patterns of climate policy [...] by increasing its support for technology innovation and development\" (Jagers & Stripple 2003). Developing these technologies further so that they are widely accessible is the next step.Experts on energy production and consumption in the U.S. project that these investments will rise by \"several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030\" (2014 Synthesis Report). This week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration released their annual outlook report, which predicted for the first time that the US will be fully self-reliant in energy by 2037.The U.S. is in a unique position to embrace these new technologies and take the lead in influencing other nations to commit to the global effort as well. The U.S. has been one of the major culprits in environmental degradation, and adopting these new technologies is a win-win for current and future generations. Despite setbacks due to state-centered interests, the indiscriminate effects of environmental damage have spurred on cooperation and shared perspectives as these shared concern have risen in prominence in recent years (Dyer 2001). While nations are still grappling over whether to declare this an issue of national concern, social values have already shifted. Commitment to ecological protection \"has been adopted as a social value in advance of any state identifying it as a matter of national interest\" (Dyer 2001). This generation is witnessing the emergence of a perspective on global social welfare that is prioritizing ecological issues (Buzan 2008), (Jagers & Stripple 2003).It's only a matter of time before our laws and technology catch up.Sources \"Annual Energy Outlook 2015 - with Projections to 2040.\" U.S. Energy Information Administration April 2015.

But, the sum total of pledges submitted thus far are not enough to honor this vow.Earlier this week, the Earth League called on world leaders to stand by their 2C pledge. In order to achieve this goal, they say that global carbon emissions will need to approach zero by 2050.That means that three quarters of known fossil fuel reserves will have to stay in the ground. Johan Rockström, one of the of the lead authors of the statement warned:\"The window to navigate ourselves free from a 'beyond 2C future' is barely open. You don't want the Earth to go from friend to foe ... this could happen quite soon; we need to bend the curve on emissions over the next 10 to 15 years.\"The Earth League also urged world leaders to put a price on carbon, and called on the richest nations to take the lead with the most stringent cuts.Last November, the U.S. and China, the world's largest emitters, set the stage for this December's Paris shindig. After nearly two decades of squabbling over who should bear the brunt of cuts, both sides agreed  to step up to the plate, and lead other nations to the table.Determined to leave a climate legacy, Barack Obama has been patiently laying down the groundwork for a robust 2015 accord. The Paris talks offer the US president a once in a lifetime chance to seal an international deal which will be remembered as a seminal moment in history.Meanwhile, Obama's Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping has put fighting pollution at the top of his agenda as a toxic smog crisis in Beijing threatens to unleash civil unrest. In many ways, the stars are looking fairly aligned for this year's climate talks in Paris.Moreover, the cost of the renewable energy is only getting cheaper and cheaper.According to Deutsche Bank, rooftop solar power will soon become the most affordable source of energy in the U.S. Meanwhile, Citigroup says that renewables will become cheaper than natural gas within the next decade.This not only makes the much needed clean energy revolution affordable, it also means that developing nations can leapfrog over conventional sources of energy like coal and go straight to solar. HSBC says  that if dramatic advances in battery storage are made, this would \"transform the energy economy.\"Yet, renewable's share of the global electricity market still stands at a meager 9 percent.But, if a strong accord is struck in Paris, it will give markets the signal to invest more heavily in this field. And, the pace of change could then take on lightening speed.Ultimately, in order to fight climate change and avoid planetary collapse, we need to rethink our relationship to nature, and learn to live in harmony with the natural world that provides us sustenance and home.According to a new report  by Capital Institute, the world needs to move beyond the stark choices of capitalism or socialism, and embrace what it refers to as holism.A holistic approach emphasizes that we are all one: connected to one another, and to all life on earth. And, by damaging any part of the web, we are ultimately only hurting ourselves.Perhaps, no where is this more apparent than in our fight against man made climate change.Only by realizing that we are all part of one global community, dependent on this planet that we all call home, will we be able to defeat this crisis, which will soon affect all life on earth."}, {"title": "WATCH: Softball-Sized Hail Pounds Texas Storm Chasers", "text": "Storm chasers Spencer Basoco and Lawrence McEwen found their windshield was no match for the giant hail falling near Stephenville, Texas, on Sunday.“This is the biggest hail I've ever seen,\" one of the men says in the video, after several hailstones crack their windshield.

That simply isn't the case. For years, Catholics in particular have been consistently vocal in opposing several provisions of the far-reaching, multinational TPP trade proposal. Some of the most controversial provisions of the TPP deal with medical care, immigration and the environment: issues Catholics, and other faith groups, care deeply about. With the livelihood of millions being affected in any final trade deal, Catholics voiced concern over President Obama seeking \"fast track\" trade promotion authority (TPA) from Congress.Catholics who believe in promoting the common good will continue to oppose fast track authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a whole until the secretive process surrounding its passage cease immediately.The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops(USCCB) issued a statement on the president's proposed TPP trade agreement. While the USCCB took no stance on fast tracking the TPP, it stated, \"we are concerned about the moral and human implications of the limits and parameters that may be set in the pending legislation for the rapid negotiation of such specific agreements, and their potential effect on human life, human dignity and the right of people to participate in decisions that impact them.\"At the 9th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Archbishop Silvano M. Tomasi, the Permanent Observer of Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva, delivered a critique of trade deals like the TPP. Archbishop Tomasi stated the \"most damaging concessions developing countries make in regional and bilateral agreements are those enhancing the monopolies on life-saving medicines, which reduce access and affordability and those that provide excessive legal rights to foreign investors.\"An article for the Guardian earlier this year confirmed the fears of Archbishop Tomasi. Leaked documents of the TPP included provisions which protect pharmaceutical monopolies and delay the release of cheaper drugs in Australia.The Columban Center for Advocacy and Outreach wrote an article last October expressing concerns the TPP would weaken environmental standards and allow corporations to operate in partner countries with little oversight. Furthermore, they claim provisions in the TPP would put the legal rights of corporations over that of individuals and governments.In February, Catholic groups joined an interfaith coalition in writing a letter to members of Congress asking them to oppose fast track. The letter stressed trade deals must \"be mutually beneficial to all countries and peoples, particularly those living in marginalized communities, not just the wealthy.\" The letter went on to compare the TPP to the controversial history of the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA).Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK and leader of \"Nuns on the Bus\", recently wrote an article for The Hill in which she laid out the Catholic opposition to fast-tracking the TPP. Sister Campbell believes a trade deal affecting millions can't be negotiated in secret. She states, \"Let the voices of all people be heard so that we might look out for our livelihoods and protect one another.\"Prior to this article, NETWORK, along with several other Catholic groups, released a statement in March declaring the TPP investment chapter unjust. The statement claimed the chapter would put profit before people.Michael Sean Winters of National Catholic Reporter makes a political case for opposing the TPP in his latest article. Winters calls on Democrats to show unity in opposing the TPP because the deal goes against the very principles President Franklin D. Roosevelt built the modern Democratic party upon: working to uplift the average citizen. Winters points to former governor of Maryland and likely 2016 presidential candidate, Martin O'Malley, as a Catholic political leader opposed to fast tracking the TPP.On April 16th, after it was announced a deal had been reached to introduce fast track authority legislation in Congress, Pennsylvania Democratic Senator and Catholic, Robert Casey said, \"Over and over again, we've been told that trade deals will create jobs and better protect workers and the environment. Those promises have never come to fruition.\"On Tuesday, Catholic and Anglican bishops in New Zealand urged greater transparency surrounding the TPP negotiations. While they acknowledged the right of governments to promote trade, the bishops were concerned with the lack of transparency and public involvement during negotiations. Furthermore, while they acknowledged traditional trade deals are done in secret; the TPP could infringe on the domestic laws of individual nations. The bishops were also concerned the TPP will adversely affect the poor.Catholics committed to the common good reject the assumption by President Obama only labor and progressive groups primarily care about controversial provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Catholics have voiced their concerns about the TPP in the past and will continue to do so in the hopes their voices will be finally heard."}, {"title": "Why Small Businesses Are Installing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations", "text": "\"If you build it, they will they charge.\"Increasingly, small businesses are installing electric vehicle charging stations as a way to attract new and loyal customers.Photo courtesy of Tom MoloughneyThe Carlisle House Bed & Breakfast in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, added an electric vehicle (EV) charging station for its guests to use during their stay. Owner Alan Duxbury said he's conscious of his environmental footprint and wants to do what he can to reduce it. He hears from customers that the charging station makes the B&B more competitive with big chain hotels nearby that aren't providing this special perk.Redhook Brewery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, recently installed an EV charging station thanks to a $3,000 rebate from PSNH, the largest utility in the granite state. Leaders in Door County, Wisconsin, installed two electric vehicle charging stations in their visitor center lot and have recruited three businesses -- the Bay Breeze Resort, the High Point Inn, and the Village of Egg Harbor -- to add charging stations to theirs too. \"There are times when we, as tourism catalysts, are called upon to be leaders and visionaries and develop new and exciting opportunities in tourism development,\" said Jack Moneypenney, the president and CEO of the Door County Visitor Bureau.Big companies, such as Walgreens, Walmart, Kohl's, and Simon Malls, have begun installing EV charging stations and see the business case. Rocky Mountain Institute compiled a guide for the costs of EV charger installation for individuals and businesses and found that the total cost per charger for a dual curb-side station is between $5,000 and $6,000. Is it financially worth it for small businesses?The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions recently did an analysis of EV charging infrastructure financing and identified promising ways to get the private sector to fund more of that infrastructure. Said study author Nick Nigro, \"Just selling electricity as a transportation service won't bring in enough revenue to pay for owning and operating the charging equipment.\" He argues that this is why charging business models must capture some of the indirect revenue that flows to other businesses, like automakers, retailers, and electric utilities.Nigo said that business owners need to take into account how much additional business these charging stations can bring in by attracting new and loyal customers eager to patronize businesses that are supporting the transition to electric mobility. According the EV charging infrastructure company ChargePoint, the installation of an EV charging stations increases customer \"dwell-time\" significantly -- by an average of 50 minutes per customer, according to one business customer. This means more time for customers to spend money.At Nauna's Bella Casa restaurant in Montclair, New Jersey, owner Tom Moloughney has two ChargePoint stations available for his diners and one ClipperCreek charging station out back for his own EV to charge. Moloughney said he initially installed the stations as a public service to help foster the adoption of electric vehicles but soon realized there are benefits for his bottom line too.\"Many of the people that come to plug in and eat tell me they only came to Nauna's because of the chargers in the parking lot, and that they didn't know of the restaurant before finding it on their EV charging app,\" said Moloughney, who has been driving electric since 2009. \"I'm averaging about five or six electric vehicles per week now, and the number is definitely on the rise.\"Drivers can find EV charging stations and potentially new places to visit and do business by using apps such as PlugShare.If you're a business owner thinking about installing EV charging stations, reporter Brad Berman has helpfully devised a step-by-step tutorial. If you have experience in this arena, share your story. Maybe you'll acquire some new customers or find some new places to shop and fuel up.Kathleen McBride and Christina Rohrbacher, Sierra Club interns, contributed to this post."}, {"title": "Colleges and Universities Answer the Call on Climate Change", "text": "This spring is anything but silent on university campuses when it comes to the issue of climate change. Many colleges and universities have been making powerful efforts to speak about the climate problem.On March 26, Clark University in Massachusetts -- a private institution with approximately 3300 undergraduate and graduate students -- held a campus-wide teach-in on the topic of climate change. The event included 45 sessions organized into four tracks, two keynote speeches, \"councils,\" and a film festival. The 600 or so participants at the teach-in formed a diverse community who understand the gravity of climate change and care enough to do something about it.Professors and invited speakers led the sessions, most of which were followed by lively discussions among the participants. Students chose from a rich collection of sessions. Speakers approached climate change from a diverse array of disciplines -- including physics, biology, chemistry, geology, geography, engineering, sociology, political science, business, international and community development, history, English, philosophy, psychology, and visual and performing arts.Climate scientist and Clark graduate Susanne Moser gave the first keynote speech, summarizing climate trends and urging the audience to take action. Quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela, \"It always seems impossible until it's done,\" Moser provided numerous examples of humankind having achieved the \"impossible\" -- such as defeating Hitler and putting a man on the moon. Because government action on climate change remains tepid, grassroots action is required, Moser said.Pennsylvania State University biology professor Christopher Uhl gave the second speech, addressing the big-picture question \"How can humans live in harmony with each other and with the Earth?\" He spoke about the culture of separation -- from our bodies, our feelings, and our true meaning and purpose; and from each other and from our Earth. Uhl proposed that the answer to climate change, as well as to other dire problems, lies in ending separation.The councils -- a forum unique to Clark and employed in prior Clark programs -- were small groups of students, faculty, and other teach-in participants. Participants came from diverse academic, social, and ethnic backgrounds and disagreed in many ways -- for example, their outlook for the future ranged all the way from complete despair to hopeful confidence -- yet the meetings were characterized by a sense of respect and unity. Participants sat in a circle and took turns speaking their thoughts and feelings about climate change. The councils provided a forum for genuine and heartfelt expression.The teach-in is not over. Discussions on campus are underway about ways Clark can build upon all that has been accomplished thus far and share with others outside the university. Clark offers suggestions about how other universities can build their own climate change teach-ins.The day after the Clark teach-in, the University of Michigan (UM) began a two-day climate change teach-in, 50 years after the university hosted the country's first teach-in on the war in Vietnam. The historic Vietnam teach-in became the seed for other teach-ins across the country, which led to massive demonstrations in Washington, D.C., which in turn led to the end of the war in Vietnam. This March's climate change program provided an opportunity for people to learn, collaborate, and demand action on a different, divisive conflict: climate change. The UM teach-in included a rally, speeches, panels, open meetings, and brainstorming workshops.In recent years, many higher-ed institutions have hosted climate change teach-ins. For example, the University of Massachusetts at Lowell held its fifth annual climate change teach-in in 2014. In 2008, more than 1,500 U.S. colleges, universities, schools, and community organizations held a student-organized climate change teach-in that was billed as the largest teach-in ever. Climate change teach-ins have been held at the University of Louisville, Swarthmore College, LIU Brooklyn, Winona State University, Colleges of the Fenway, and Roanoke College, to name a few. International examples include the First European Climate Teach-In Day 2009 and the World Climate Teach-In Day held in 2010.Universities also engage in other sorts of climate change-related activities. For example, on March 26, Antioch University New England (AUNE) in New Hampshire presented a webinar on climate change communication strategies. AUNE's Center for Climate Preparedness and Community Resilience, launched in 2014, partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to convene the Local Solutions: Northeast Climate Preparedness Conference. The Center's mission is to prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate impacts through collaborative, innovative solutions, on a local, as well as national and international, scale.The AUNE webinar was one in a series of climate change webinars co-created by the Center and the EPA. Participants hailed from Canada, Lebanon, Greece, Oman, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Zambia, Columbia, Egypt, France, China, Grenada, and Mexico. The Center and EPA are currently partnering, along with the City of Baltimore, to co-create the 2016 Local Solutions: Eastern Regional Climate Preparedness Conference.Universities also lead on climate change by piloting and modeling practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Example practices include energy and water conservation, alternate transportation, carbon-free energy, green buildings, and recycling. The American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment serves as a high-visibility effort to address climate change on campuses. To date, 697 colleges and universities have signed the commitment, which entails completing a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, scheduling reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, taking immediate steps to reduce emissions, integrating sustainability into the curriculum, and making the action plan, inventory, and progress reports publicly available.This spring, students and others have been staging demonstrations at a number of colleges and universities throughout the U.S. and abroad, urging them to divest their fossil fuel company holdings. A growing number of colleges and universities have already committed to divest -- including at least 22 in the U.S., two in the United Kingdom, and one each in the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, and Sweden.Universities lead on climate change by working in partnerships with other universities and other institutions. For example, the Harvard China Project was founded in 1993 as an interdisciplinary program to study China's atmospheric environment, energy system and economy, and the role of environment in U.S.-China relations. Harvard President Drew Faust calls the partnership \"an engine of broad environmental knowledge that has influenced policy in both countries, and improved the lives of our citizens.\"People at universities are -- to some extent -- allowed to think differently, work across disciplines, and speak out in ways that others cannot. For example, the University of Wisconsin's Center for Climate Research investigates climate change globally, assesses climate change impacts on state resources, develops adaptation strategies, and held a two-day climate change symposium in March 2015. But a month later, Wisconsin officials banned employees of a state agency from discussing climate change or even responding to an email about the warming climate. Similarly, the Florida Climate Institute, with eight member Florida universities, performs extensive climate change research, education, and outreach. Meanwhile, Florida Department of Environmental Protection employees are barred from using the phrases \"climate change\" and \"global warming\" in any official communications, emails, or reports.Universities are unique in bringing the full array of disciplines to bear on the problem of climate change. Universities in all parts of the world research climate change origins, trends, and impacts; develop new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and shape institutions and policies.Will universities rescue our climate? Not single-handedly. But students, educators, researchers, and administrators are leading the way, lending hope that we will successfully address our climate problem.Ellen Moyer, Ph.D., P.E., is an independent consultant dedicated to remediating environmental problems and promoting green practices to prevent new problems.

Nowadays, the fashion industry talks extensively about becoming sustainable. Yet it concentrates mostly on one side of the story: how raw materials are made and the impact of production processes on the environment. By doing this, the industry avoids addressing the issue of how people are treated in the supply chain. And thus, it remains a highly unsustainable industry.What are sustainable products? Products that last and that are made through processes that are good for people and the environment.If a product doesn't last and needs replacing after a couple of seasons, it is not sustainable. To last, products must be well made, which in fashion means not at mass-production levels but by well-organized and skilled craft-people. Fashion used to be made by craft-people (I will call them artisans from now on), but generally this is not the case anymore and this is for three reasons.Firstly, to reduce the costs associated to labor -- and therefore to reduce fixed costs -- and to maximize profits, fashion moved to industrialization. From thereafter, artisans were gradually excluded from production and the cost of labor was brought down. A person that repeatedly performs the same task (like attaching a zip) is paid less than somebody making the whole product or a substantial part of it.Secondly, production started to be outsourced to countries with cheap labor. With simplified tasks and products, they became movable. Thirdly, the fashion industry began subcontracting production to specialized trading companies to manage production, which means brands avoid direct connections with the actual producers, and thus evade the responsibility of labor conditions.In the places where real artisans remained in the supply chain, fashion has adopted another system: sending all the materials, requesting artisans to input their work, but dictating the value of this work, benchmarked on the remuneration of mass production in Asia. This is why people rightly say that today the world is divided into \"Asia\" and \"not Asia.\" The first is a place where work is highly industrialized and corporate-social-responsibility schemes (CSR schemes) are more or less ignored, the second are places where the industry and artisans struggle to catch up.This has resulted in three serious consequences:1. A decrease in quality: fashion products are not always the beautiful products they used to be. 2. People from this industry have lost knowledge of artisanal skills: some forms of production are becoming more and more difficult to conceive. 3. Fashion products tend to last less.All this is unsustainable. One can use all the organic materials he/she wants, but by manufacturing products this way, they will always remain unsustainable as they won't last and people who have the know-how of making them well will disappear.This situation is already visible in one of the cradles of fashion manufacturing: Italy.My argument is made with reference to the production of a luxury bag. Remuneration in Italy 10 years ago for the construction of a bag was invoiced at €23 to €25 per hour, plus overheads. It then went down to €19 to €20 per hour, plus overheads. One must know that, on average, a bag requires two to three hours of work for a skilled artisan, paid fairly (meaning it includes the costs of social security, etc.) Today, some fashion brands are proposing a different way of work: a flat rate for the entire work at €19 (or even less) per bag, including everything. This makes it impossible for an artisan to survive. Not by chance, many allegations of illegal employment involving immigrant workers with no social security or employment protection, have recently surfaced in Italy (see Rai's Report). People accept this work as they need it, and sometimes they complement it with other, better-paid commissioned work. Yet they gradually close down their companies and look for employment elsewhere.In Kenya, where our program, the Ethical Fashion Initiative, coordinates the production of accessories for large brands, we invoice €13 for a bag similar to the one described above, plus overheads. This is roughly two thirds of what is paid in Italy, where productivity (the number of units per hour) is higher and, thus, there is a drive to bring this price down. Yet this allows us to pay artisans a living wage.This happens because the benchmark of mass production is so low that everybody, in Italy and in Africa, has to decrease prices. Nobody can compete and artisans are disappearing. Today, being an artisan is not a good job anymore. At the same time, this means that products do not last and are unsustainable.Technology is not a solution to this: the sector of luxury accessories is using the same mature technology of years ago, with the hands of people as a key input. You cannot use 3D printing to make a luxury bag. At least not yet.My opinion is that, instead of concentrating only on the environmental footprint of fashion production, we should all have a look at its handprint. Are people able to get a life out of the work they do with their hands? To me, this is the core issue this industry should look into, if they truly intend to become sustainable, rather than the green washing sometimes used to run away from responsibilities.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

His wise pronouncements and humble manner inspire thousands of pilgrims and tourists to pack his appearances at St. Peter's Basilica. This week the pope is drawing yet another group to the Eternal City: international leaders on climate change and environmental protection.The Vatican is convening a conference here called \"Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity\" on Tuesday. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will give the keynote address, and economist Jeffrey Sachs and other sustainability experts will be in attendance.Why are these worldly leaders gathering in the heart of the Roman Catholic Church? Because Pope Francis has declared that addressing climate change is a moral imperative.Photo credit: Martin SchulzThe pope understands that climate change is a humanitarian crisis that threatens the entire human community, especially the poor and most vulnerable among us.Days after Typhoon Haiyan pounded the Philippines in 2013, Pope Francis spoke about climate change, saying, \"We have in a sense taken over nature,\" and the results have been devastating. That one cyclone -- among the most powerful ever recorded -- killed more than 6,300 people and left 4 million people homeless. Storms have always threatened the Philippines, but now they are packed with greater intensity and hitting a region that's seen 8 inches of sea level rise since 1970.When climate change supercharges weather patterns, the disadvantaged often suffer first and most. Latino farm workers in California have had their livelihoods crushed by ongoing drought. Impoverished laborers in eastern India became homeless this month when heavy rains destroyed thousands of huts. And women around the globe are 14 times more likely to die than men are when extreme weather hits.The movement for climate justice is growing, and Pope Francis' personal engagement is contributing a powerful call to action. This summer he will release an encyclical -- one of the highest forms of Catholic teachings -- on climate change. It is expected to link protecting the environment to fighting global inequality.The encyclical will reach beyond the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to the millions of others who respect his moral authority. It is also expected to influences the next round of Sustainable Development Goals that the UN will consider this September, and the international climate talks to be held in Paris this December.The commitments made in both these arenas have the power to lift millions of people out of poverty and shield future generations from unchecked climate change. We must seize this opportunity.When I first started working on climate change two decades ago, the issue got little coverage, and most of it focused on melting ice caps and distant glaciers. Now that extreme weather is hitting home, it's clear that this is about human well-being. It's about shielding people from danger, promoting justice, and making our communities more resilient places to live.This starts with protecting the planet and the resources we all depend on. As Pope Francis tweeted on Earth Day, \"You have to keep the land so that it can continue to be, as God wants it, the source of life for the entire human family.\""}, {"title": "7 Ways Transit, Bikes & Walking Move Us to Brighter Future", "text": "According to the nation's pundits and prophets, the future of transportation is all figured out for us. Cheaper gas prices mean we can still count on our private cars to take us everywhere we want to go in the years to come. The only big change down the road will be driverless autos, which will make long hours behind the wheel less boring and more productive.But this everything-stays-the-same vision ignores some significant social developments. Americans have actually been driving less per-capita for the past decade, bucking a century-long trend of ever-increasing dependence on automobiles.  This startling turnaround is usually written off as a mere statistical blip caused by the great recession and $4 gas, both of which hit in 2008. But, in fact, the driving decline began several years before that.  Spearheading this trend of less driving is the Millennial generation, who after spending much of their childhoods confined in the backseats of minivans, is eager for a wider range of transportation choices.Here are some little known facts about how we get around:---Americans made 10.8 billion trips on public transportation in 2014--the highest number since 1956 when the massive mobilization to build highways and push suburban development began. These numbers represent a 37 percent transit increase since 1995.---Meanwhile bike commuting is up 60 percent over the past decade, according to census figures.   ---And people are walking 6 percent more than in 2005, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This is good news for everybody because broader transportation choices are linked to a wealth of social and economic benefits. Buses, trains, bikes and walking represent more than an efficient means of getting from one place to another. They move us toward a brighter future.   1. Stimulating New Development Along Transit Corridors New rapid transit systems are about more than transportation. They are magnets for economic vitality-- a major reason why 19 U.S. regions without train transit have built light rail systems since 1981 (and nearly all regions with rail have expanded theirs).The new light rail between downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul helped generate $2.5 billion in development (more than double the cost) before the line opened last June. Even buses spurs new development. Cleveland invested $50 million in the HealthLine Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line-- with specially designed buses moving swiftly in an exclusive lane on city streets-- and saw $5.8 billion in new development along a 7-mile route from downtown to the city's east side.  2. Driving the Real Estate Market in a New Direction A recent study from the George Washington University (GWU) Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis suggests that auto-dominated suburban development has passed its peak. The greatest potential for future real estate growth is Walkable Urban Places (WalkUPs), which depend upon quality public transportation and biking opportunities.Among the report's notable findings are:---Metropolitan areas ranking high for WalkUP districts have 38 percent higher GDP per capita than those ranking low.  ----Offices in WalkUP districts rent for a 74 percent premium per square foot over those in more auto-oriented settings.3. Saving Money for American HouseholdsTransportation costs rival housing costs for many American families, especially those living in areas with inadequate transit service, according to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Transportation accounts for 25 percent of household costs in \"Auto Dependent Exurbs\", compared to 9 percent in walkable communities with good transit connections. Commuters taking a train or bus instead of a car save $10,064 on average per year.4. Making a Difference in Economic and Racial Inequality \"In these times of high unemployment and unprecedented income inequality, transportation policy is one of the most pressing civil and human rights issues facing our nation,\" writes civil rights activist Lexer Quamie. Quamie notes that 19 percent of African-Americans and 13.7 percent of Latinos lack access to cars, compared to 4.6 percent of whites.  5. Meeting the Needs of America's Aging Generations Transit, biking and walking are not just for young people. A transportation crisis looms as more baby boomers become senior citizens, with some of them unable, unwilling or unsafe to drive.6. Boosting Our Health (and Cutting America's Medical Costs) An often overlooked benefit of more transportation options beyond cars is improved public health. Biking and walking allow you to get exercise in the course of your daily activities, rather than trying to squeeze a workout into your already crowded schedule. And almost all bus and train trips involve a walk on both ends of the ride. Thirty minutes of moderate daily physical activity like biking and walking five days a week is recommended the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.7. Curbing Global Climate Change Between 1990 (when global warming was first widely recognized as a threat) and 2006, transportation accounted for almost half of all growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with surface transportation accounting for 85 percent."}, {"title": "The Ocean's Gentle Giant", "text": "There are mysteries in nature that are better left unsolved. The enigmas we are incapable of decoding could be the Earth's strategy to safeguard those species which are otherwise vulnerable to man's greed and cruelty.Many are the examples that come to mind. For instance: have you ever heard of the Basking shark? An ocean creature that can grow to be ten meters long. It plows through the waters of the world and, ironically, often goes unnoticed. It disappears during the winter months, but shows up again in the spring. Where do these gentle giants of the ocean go? What do they do? Hypothetical explanations are all we have.Last week an Italian news website, Ravenna Today, reported the sighting of an eight-meter-long basking shark in the Adriatic Sea, at about six miles off the coast of a city called Cervia.Basking sharks are one of the biggest fish in the world, second only to whale sharks. Their scientific name is: Cetorhinus maximus. It derives from the Greek words ketos, marine monster, and rhinos, \" nose \" , because of their long snout. Maximus is a clear reference to the animal's size. Although their dimensions and name might induce us to fear them, basking sharks are harmless to human beings.The Cetorhinus maximus can be sighted traveling alone or in groups. They swim slowly both in deep and shallow waters with their mouths wide open, to catch as much plankton as possible. They often pay us a visit here in the Mediterranean area. Our temperate seas hold precious food supplies for a great number of marine inhabitants and the gentle giants make no exception. After all who doesn't enjoy a banquet!But, and it is frustrating to have to add the word \" but \" on a constant basis, like with too many other living beings on our planet, basking sharks appear on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list as an endangered species and are protected under the CITES Appendix II whose website states that although they are not threatened with extinction, \" they may become so unless trade is closely controlled. \"WildLifeRisk, a nongovernmental Hong Kong-based wildlife conservation organization issued a report in January 2014 stating that about 600 whale sharks and basking sharks are being processed by a factory in China every year. This is illegal and an inevitable question emerges: how many other factories could be involved in this unlawful trend?What makes these majestic creatures so appetizing to fisheries around the globe? The fact that a single carcass is worth tens of thousands of dollars. Shark fins are sold to restaurants for shark fin soup. A single bowl can cost over 100 dollars. The skin goes to manufacturers for bags, the oil is bought by companies to make fish oil supplements and the meat becomes food.In one form or another many people consume shark products and in many cases are led to believe that a shark steak or shark fin soup are healthy.It's not difficult to debunk such a misconception. All it takes is one word: mercury. All it takes is a simple search on the Internet to find scientific evidence of the toxic levels of mercury found in shark meat. The mercury present in fins, cartilage and shark flesh can be extremely dangerous to us.Mercury has always been present on Earth, it was produced naturally by wildfires and volcanoes. However 2/3 of the mercury in our atmosphere today is man-made, like coal-burning power plants and waste incinerators. The substance travels in the air for thousands of miles. It is then released into our oceans either directly through rainfall or indirectly through runooff, it enters the marine food chain and eventually becomes products we eat or use.This is the reason why the consumption of shark products carry labels from important organizations such as the (FDA) U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the (EPA) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and (WHO), the World Health Organization.The Web lists a great number of medical studies that indicate how mercury can affect our health. In adults it can cause damage to the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Many organizations advise pregnant women and children not to consume shark meat at all, because a developing brain is very vulnerable to mercury.As I watched the video of the basking shark's visit to the Adriatic with my ten-year-old son I kept thinking, nature doesn't need us. Nature has always been here, she has always survived. Human beings on the other hand depend on nature; without her we are doomed. It's that simple.\"Mom, do you think I will ever see a real shark in the ocean?\"I was about to answer: \"Of course you will Danny \" but I stopped myself. Children need to know the truth, always. \"I'm not sure sweetheart, but I will do my part, I will do my best to give you that chance. \""}, {"title": "Black Churches Are Going Green", "text": "As a child growing up in California, my parents would joke that we were from Hollywood. Our family was from Holly, Louisiana -- and Holly was down in the woods.  Thirty miles from Shreveport, Holly was where a cadre of ex-slaves purchased 100 acres of land in 1878 and planted their fields. They also planted the St. Mark Baptist Church, which is still serving black families more than a century later. These farmers -- my ancestors -- heeded the call of men like Booker T. Washington, who urged them to stay in the South, work hard, pay their taxes, and vote. Years later, despite their hard work and belief in the American dream, most of the families lost their farms to ruthless racists and the stock-market crash of 1929. The brutality of these two powerful forces pushed the family from land ownership to a new status of sharecroppers.   But deep connection to land and spirit were always a part of our family story -- just like it is a part of the story of almost every black family in America. It's this legacy of good stewardship of the planet that drove me to help start Green The Church. In partnership with Green For All, the Green The Church initiative taps into the power of the Black church as a force for social change, while bringing the benefits of the green economy directly to congregants.Today, Green The Church has taken on a new urgency.  We're watching climate change unfold before our eyes -- bringing severe droughts, erratic weather, superstorms and disasters. And while climate change threatens people everywhere, communities of color are on the front lines.Consider this: African Americans living in Los Angeles are nearly twice as likely to die in a heat wave, thanks to lack of access to air conditioning, shade and cars. And when disasters strike, it's people with the fewest resources who have a harder time preparing, escaping and recovering. Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy drove that point home.Black communities aren't just hit first and worst by climate change; we also stand to gain enormously from solutions to global warming.  The Green The Church initiative aims to bring the benefits of sustainability directly to our communities. We've joined forces with the U.S. Green Building Council to help our buildings save energy and generate clean power.  Green The Church partners like Reverend Otis Moss of Trinity United in Chicago are already leading on this issue. Reverend Moss' church is powered by the sun -- and even produces enough solar energy to power the home of an elderly neighbor. Meanwhile, the congregation is helping keep pollution from dirty-coal plants out of the air and doing its part to combat climate change.It's not just about helping churches save energy (and money). Green The Church taps into the unmatched power of the African-American church as a moral leader and a force for social change -- one with the potential to bring millions of new people into the climate movement. Polls show that African Americans consistently demonstrate the highest level of commitment to climate solutions. We need to harness that commitment -- and engaging the church is one of the best ways we can do it.  That's why Green For All is working to bring 1,000 black churches into Green The Church this year. Black churches -- and the millions of voters they represent -- could make the difference in whether we win or lose on climate.  Black churches are going green. It's exciting, but it shouldn't be surprising. Caring for the land and our neighbors is part of a legacy and responsibility that African-American families have upheld for decades -- in Holly, Louisiana, and in towns just like it all over America.For more information about Green The Church--and to find out how to sign your church up, visit here.Rev. Dr. Ambrose F. Carroll is co-founder of Green The Church and works with Green For All, a national organization working to build an inclusive green economy.

In 1986, he co-founded Farm Sanctuary. Now almost 30 years later, Farm Sanctuary is America's premier farm animal protection organization, a safe haven for factory farm animals abused and/or left for dead, and a transformative place for people, too. Farm Sanctuary offers education, outreach and the opportunity to rediscover our primal bond with animals.\"Farm animals are not that different from cats and dogs,\" says Baur. \"They have feelings, relationships, respect and compassion.\" Their open affection remind of us our own humanity. And our responsibility. \"We don't share our lives with animals just because we want to. We do it because we need them,\" Baur writes in Living the Farm Sanctuary Life.Co-written with Gene Stone, Baur's new book provides a little Farm Sanctuary wherever you are, with adorable farm animal photos, pleasing plant-based recipes from fab chefs and cookbook authors including Chad Sarno, even one from Baur. And of course, transformation.There are stories about rescued farm animals, like a ewe named Hilda, Farm Sanctuary's first rescue and resident. Just as compelling are the stories of people whose lives have changed after close encounters of the animal kind, from a former pig farmer to Twitter creator (and vegan) Biz Stone. Baur's book also shows you how to to live according to Farm Sanctuary's five tenets:Live and Eat in Alignment with Your Values Engage in a Mindful Connection with Animals Engage in a Mindful connection with Your Food Eat Plants. . . for Your Health Eat Plants. . . for the Health of the EarthTaken together, it's a recipe for \"compassionate vegan living. You can live and do well without meat.\" And it's easy. \"Try Meatless Monday, substitute meatless meats for meats,\" Baur suggests. \"Small changes lead to bigger changes.\"One small change that's helped lead to bigger ones and greater vegan acceptance is the current state of vegan eats, more accessible and more delicious than when Baur went vegan in 1985. One thing hasn't changed in three decades. \"Health,\" says Baur, \"is the biggest driver.\" You want healthy? Hello, powerful plant-fueled athletes like David Carter. Rich Roll, Ellen Jaffe Jones, even Baur, who's been running marathons and triathlons to prove vegan and buff go together.Farm Sanctuary's undergone other big changes. In addition to the original site in Watkins Glen, there's now two more animal sanctuaries in California. That's more than 500 acres of land for happy, healthy animals. Along with expanded acreage is expanded awareness. \"It's an exciting time,\" says Baur. \"People are starting to think about the impact of animal agriculture on nature and that's a very good thing. People want more mindful choices, there's more momentum than ever, a convergence of awareness. That gives me a lot of hope.\"Now as it enters its third decade, Farm Sanctuary is working to reach more people, from the underserved to \"people in urban places,\" as well as tying in to existing and emerging trends. They're all little steps which taken together \"catapult it to the next level.\"As Farm Sanctuary evolves, its goal remains the same. \"To save animals' lives,\" says Baur. \"One of the best ways to do that is by not eating them.

This is not unusual for us, but on this particular day we took a route we hadn't walked in quite some time. I was pleased to notice that one of the traditional, colonial-style houses we encountered was sporting solar panels on its roof. And then we noticed another. And another. And yet more, so many that we lost count. Not every house, certainly, but enough in this particular section of northwest D.C. to make a strong impression.I don't think those panels were there the last time we walked the route, and it made me wonder whether there has been some leadership in the neighborhood, or perhaps a push by a local installer, one of which, Solar Solution, had a sign in front of one of the homes, making me think at least that particular installation was quite new.But that wasn't all. On another walk in a different part of the neighborhood, coming home from the gym, I took a shortcut through an alley and noticed yet another array of panels in the rear of one of the homes. I may be slow to catch on, but eventually I know a trend when I see one.In fact, \"US solar power grew by 6.2 gigawatts in 2014, a 30 percent increase over the previous year and representing nearly $18 billion in new investment,\" according to data released last month by the Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research, reported by Daniel Cusick for ClimateWire and reprinted in Scientific American. A similar amount of growth is projected for 2015, adds Cusick, because of \"falling costs for solar panels and modules, business model innovation that allows for more flexibility in ownership, favorable political and regulatory environments, and increased access to low-cost capital.\" Solar accounted for nearly a third of the nation's new generating capacity in 2014, more than either coal or wind (though less than natural gas).The trend is definitely on the upswing. The nation's market in photovoltaic panels has grown fourfold since 2009, even discounting concentrated solar facilities. \"Residential PV continues to be the fastest-growing market segment in the US solar sector, riding three consecutive years of 50 percent or higher annual growth,\" according to Cusick.For example, Peter Murtha and his family reside in Silver Spring, Maryland, just north of the D.C. border. Murtha blogged about his experience with solar panels on the Washington Post website, recounting the benefits to a homeowner:Being tied to the grid means that you in essence \"sell\" the power you produce to the utility -- which is great when you are producing more power than you are using. It also permits you to generate renewable energy credits but means that in a power outage, you are \"down\" with everyone else on the block. Having a solar array also means having a special \"smart meter\" (supplied at no extra charge by the utility) which measures the amount of power you are producing and the amount your home is consuming, with the \"net usage\" reflected on the meter.Nearly half of Murtha's electricity needs are met by the onsite solar generation, and he estimates that his entire net investment (after government tax credits and grants are considered) of around $24,000 will be recouped in about 10 years after his system went online in 2012. Murtha also estimates that, because the technology and installation have become more affordable, a consumer could probably buy a comparable system for 25 percent less today than he paid in 2012.Public incentives for household solar installations include a 30-percent federal tax credit (due to expire at the end of 2016, unless extended), state credits and incentives (which vary but in Murtha's case included a taxable $1,000 clean energy grant from Maryland) and tradable solar renewable energy credits available in states that require a certain portion of their overall energy portfolio to consist of renewables.In addition, some consumers are choosing to lease rather than purchase their rooftop solar arrays, saving upfront costs in exchange for a long-term rental contract priced to still allow significant monthly and annual savings to the homeowners.So this is all good news, right? Major reductions in carbon pollution, substantial monetary savings for consumers, and even a burgeoning industry employing well over 100,000 workers and growing at over 10 times the rate of the overall U.S. economy, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. There's something in it for the utilities, too, since reduced strain on the national electric grid means fewer blackouts and less need to invest in expensive power plants. Even the Christian Coalition of America has voiced strong support for continued incentives that favor solar.Unfortunately, it seems that whenever there is progress, there's opposition. Some fossil-fuel-based utilities are getting uptight about losing market share, according to an article written by Joby Warrick and published in the Washington Post. Determined to slow the growth of solar, the companies have persuaded authorities in Arizona and Wisconsin to slap a monthly surcharge on consumers for the practice of \"net metering\" described by Peter Murtha. They are targeting additional states, and Warrick reports that \"in some states, industry officials have enlisted the help of minority groups in arguing that solar panels hurt the poor by driving up electricity rates for everyone else.\"That claim is vigorously disputed by analysts independent of the utilities, as well as by Denise Fairchild, the president and CEO of Emerald Cities Collaborative, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to climate-resilience strategies that produce environmental, economic and equity outcomes. Fairchild writes in Governing that, in fact, \"the utility industry's efforts to turn back the clean-energy revolution would block low-income communities from realizing the benefits.\" The last thing minority communities of color need, argues Fairchild, is something that makes the shift to cleaner and more efficient technologies less affordable:Net metering surcharges are also akin to restrictive covenants, which legally prohibited certain races from the benefits of living in American suburbs, locking African-Americans and other ethnic groups into urban ghettos. Surcharges similarly lock the poor and people of color out of the emerging clean-energy future, including not only cleaner, cheaper and newer energy options but also the \"green\" jobs that these new industries are creating.The case in favor of charging customers even when they are not using utility-generated electricity seems to boil down to this: Because net-metering customers still must connect to the grid, some utilities argue, those customers should pay for the costs of maintaining the grid. I suppose that's fair to a point, but the larger point is that it is grossly discriminatory and unfair -- as well as counter to the public interest in reduced dependence on fossil fuels -- to slap a special surcharge only on those customers who are using the grid the least.The truth is that renewables such as solar represent the future. And so, importantly, does overall efficiency in electricity consumption, as we have already seen with advances in lighting, appliance and building technology. Utilities and their regulators should be looking forward, not backward, to find ways to invest in progress -- and make money doing so -- rather than trying desperately to cling to yesterday's business model, which is based on encouraging more and more consumption of polluting sources of energy. (Last year there was at least one encouraging sign that some enlightened industry leaders are, in fact, interested in forward-looking partnerships.)Nonetheless, Warrick's article notes:Legislation to make net metering illegal or more costly has been introduced in nearly two dozen state houses since 2013. Some of the proposals were virtual copies of model legislation drafted two years ago by the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a nonprofit organization with financial ties to billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch.Most of the bills have failed -- even in conservative states such as Utah and Indiana -- which is one reason that in many states the utilities are now shifting their advocacy to the friendlier terrain of public utilities commissions.Move your cursor over the images for credit information.Kaid Benfield writes about community, development, and the environment on The Huffington Post and in other national media.

Mayor Bloomberg saw projections of New York's population growth and realized that environmental goals needed to be integrated into the city's economic development goals. The plan's focus on measurable accomplishments and frequent performance reporting mirrored the highly successful anti-crime techniques pioneered by the NYPD's CompStat system. Key to the success of PlaNYC was its clear status as a mayoral priority. PlaNYC joined environment to the mayor's top priority of economic development. Last week, we may have seen a similar moment in policy development as Mayor de Blasio linked sustainability to his top goal of poverty reduction. The fact that he is attempting to integrate sustainability with his highest priority is a strong indication that sustainability goals will continue to advance in New York City.The different goals of our very distinct mayors reflect the different conditions they inherited when they assumed office. Mayor Bloomberg took office less than one hundred days after the horror of the World Trade Center's destruction. Our confidence was low and the city's economic viability was under threat. Bloomberg's steady, business-like approach and his focus on management and economic development reassured New Yorkers and led to a decade of renewal. In 2008 and 2009, the shock of the Great Recession further reinforced the need to create a city attractive to businesses that would bring energy, creativity, money and employment to the City.Mayor de Blasio took office in a revived city, but one that many working and middle class residents were struggling to afford. Occupy Wall Street placed extreme income inequality on the political agenda. Policing and racial profiling had become a political issue and Bill de Blasio was able to dominate the Democratic mayoral race with a clear articulation of what he termed \"progressive values and principles.\" Anyone observing the mayor's first 16 months can see that unless the goal relates directly to his overall progressive agenda, it has trouble gaining traction. Sustainability seemed to flounder until the mayor and his team found a way to integrate it into his social and economic equity agenda.That is the good news. The bad news is that as influential as New York City might be, it does not have the capacity to lift 800,000 people out of poverty. The anti-poverty goal set by OneNYC is laudable, but not under the city's control. New York can create and implement universal pre-K, a critical element of an anti-poverty program. It can provide municipal IDs and can undertake a variety of other equity-oriented initiatives. But in the end, New York City's powers are limited and derived from the State of New York's claims to sovereignty under American federalism. Mayor Bloomberg learned the limits of his power to implement PlaNYC when the state legislature defeated congestion pricing. PlaNYC tried, but did not accomplish, increased spending on mass transit and a reduction in motor vehicle traffic in New York's central business district. Mayor de Blasio can propose and envision an anti-poverty program just as he can propose and envision a Utica Avenue subway (an ancient dream of those of us from Flatlands), but he has little power to achieve either of those goals.I assume the Mayor knows all this. He is travelling all over the country because he knows that the issue of income redistribution is a national political issue, not an issue that can be addressed at the municipal level. What concerns me as it relates to sustainability planning is that while sustainability is hitched to a goal that the mayor believes is vital, it is not a goal that city governments can do much about. In contrast, the goal of local economic development is a principle function of local government. Mayor Bloomberg linked sustainability to economic development, a goal that the mayor of New York has a wide range of tools to influence. An abbreviated list of mayoral economic development powers include: zoning, building codes, the implementation of tax-based economic development incentives, purchasing, infrastructure construction through the capital budget and deployment of city assets ranging from police to parks.The issue of income distribution requires national economic and tax policy. While a local war on poverty is not feasible, local governments can do a great deal to promote upward mobility. For a local government like New York City, poverty reduction is accomplished indirectly through the public programs that provide housing and rent subsidies, along with investments in improved schools, libraries, parks and transit. Public safety and low-cost health care also make it possible for New York to maintain a diverse population. Funding all of these local programs costs money and so New York has worked for many years to attract businesses and wealthy people.One of the success stories of the Bloomberg administration was making the city attractive to the international elite. However, one of the outcomes of that attraction is that real estate prices all over the city are rising quickly and increasing the cost of housing for long-time residents and their children. The delicate public policy issue that is within mayoral control is: How do we encourage the wealthy to participate in our real estate market without driving out the rest of us? How can the city tax some of the new real estate wealth to provide housing subsidies for working New Yorkers? Wealthy non-residents own a growing number of the city's high-priced condos; some only stay in town once in a while and may have bought the place as an investment. This type of ownership reduces the supply of housing and indirectly may increase its price for people who want to live here. \"Set asides\" and other policies can be used to fund housing for people who aren't rich. Otherwise, given the stress on the real estate market, it won't be long before poverty will be reduced in New York City because poor people simply can't afford the cost of our housing. There'll be less poor people in the city because they'll all live in Long Island or New Jersey.It is clear that the mayor's team understands the housing challenge, but its integration into the sustainability and anti-poverty goals are less clear. In my view, the goal of lifting people out of poverty is not a local issue. On the other hand, retaining a diverse population is a central and achievable goal of New York City's government. This is one of the goals of OneNYC. Under Vision 1, \"our growing thriving city,\" the plan advocates a simple goal for housing: \"New Yorkers will have access to affordable, high-quality housing coupled with robust infrastructure and neighborhood services.\" The de Blasio plan advocates the use of city land to build one to four family homes for working and middle class families; holistic community-based planning to promote new housing, and mandatory \"inclusionary housing\" to require developers to build subsidized housing units when they build market rate units.One test of these OneNYC initiatives will come when a housing development is proposed on a piece of land that is needed for a green infrastructure project, or when a proposed housing development stresses local infrastructure or environmental quality. These are solvable problems, although they may require tough trade-off choices. A second, central test will be the transformation of many of the aspirational, visionary goals of OneNYC into specific, operational management indicators. Enlightened vision is good, but tangible, on-the-ground, measurable performance is better. Let's have both."}, {"title": "Chipotle Becomes First Major Restaurant Chain To Serve Only GMO-Free Food", "text": "From the tortillas to the salsa to the chips and marinades, everything served at Chipotle will now be GMO-free.Starting Monday, the Mexican fast food chain will only serve food that’s devoid of genetically modified ingredients, The New York Times reports. This will be a first for a major restaurant chain.“This is another step toward the visions we have of changing the way people think about and eat fast food,” the company’s co-CEO Steve Ells told the Times. “Just because food is served fast doesn’t mean it has to be made with cheap raw ingredients, highly processed with preservatives and fillers and stabilizers and artificial colors and flavors.”Chipotle has reportedly been working for years to become GMO-free. In 2013, the company became the first restaurant chain to disclose all GMO-containing ingredients on its menu.“Genetically modified foods hold out promises that are at best untested, and at worst unrealistic,” Ells wrote in a blog post last year. “Traditional edible plants and animals have evolved alongside humans over thousands of years to provide the people who eat them with essential nourishment. In exchange for this, we have an obligation to those plants and animals to keep caring for them responsibly. For most of our history, it's been a great deal for all involved. And we'd like to help keep it that way.”According to CNNMoney, Chipotle’s pork and chicken will still come from animals that eat GMO-feed. However, the chain says its been successful in switching out all other GMO-containing ingredients from its menu, including swapping soybean oil for GMO-free sunflower oil and rice bran oil.“We want to make the old fast food model irrelevant,” Ells told CNNMoney. “We want to make great ingredients and classic cooking techniques accessible to everybody.”"}, {"title": "Coachella Gets Conscious Because Our Generation Demands It", "text": "While I am reflecting on all of the sustainability initiatives at Coachella it seems fitting for this festival to fall so closely to Earth Day. Coachella has been getting dissed lately. And by that I mean that the longtime festival-goers who have been heading to Palm Springs since this whole music event started are bummed. Some complain that the acts aren't as indie, others say that it's become too mainstream and crowded (now the long lineup of non-stop music is repeated for a second weekend in order to fill the demand). But in the three years that I've gone, I've noticed one change more than any of the others -- the emphasis Coachella is placing on sustainability. Heck, if that's what's next for mainstream then I am totally ready to rock out to that! And it is catching the mainstream, the younger generations, and it's becoming more of a demand by millennials than an added plus.As one of the founders of BuyConscious.com (a site my co-founder and I started in order to profile brands and people who are focused on serving the community and planet), I am thrilled to see young people/millennials start to care more and more about their environment and their impact on it. And don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Azealia Banks and Florence and the Machine just completely killing it on stage, but my highlight was definitely cruising the conscious corners.The food choices were shockingly widespread and abundant for a festival. Booths offered organic, gluten-free, vegan and local options, and you could tell just by looking at the menus that local vendors were given tons of priority. There were incredibly fun stations where you could actively take part in helping the festival stay as green as possible. The TRASHed area was \"pretty rad\" as they say out here in Cali. With its #ArtOfRecylcing (ongoing awareness program) partnering up for the big weekend, they dispersed artist-painted trash bins for recycling that were like art pieces themselves. They also offered different prizes: For every ten bottles that were picked up and brought to their tent, you could exchange that for a full water bottle. And with that afternoon heat hitting the high 80s and 90s, trust me, those $2 water bottles add up!This year Coachella even went solar just to show how easy the transition to renewable energy can be. And to cut down on the gas emissions, Coachella rewarded those who took part in \"Carpoolchella\" with secret spotters who went around searching for the marked cars and distributed awards such as VIP tickets for next year. I personally was carpooled in BMW's cute new i3 electric vehicle. I think we spent a total of $6 round trip, fueling at charging stations along the route. That's music to my wallet!I definitely don't consider myself to be a music snob, but I'm still a tough critic. I have to say, Coachella as a whole was yet again a great experience -- I was introduced to new artists I otherwise may have never heard, new methods to practice what I preach with consciousness and sustainability, and threw on my old school hippie clothes that honestly made me feel a little bit closer to my parents' generation, if only for a short weekend. It may not be Woodstock, but it's still a dang good time. And if you're not digging the music then at least you'll love the taste of the dairy-free coconut ice cream.

Torrential rains leading to landslides in the mountains. Desert-like droughts in the crop-growing areas. Rises in cancer with a grim reaper hanging around every person, waiting to claim the person's life and the lives of their descendants. Increase of mosquitoes and diseases. People driven to poverty due to either the lack of rains for crops or the crops being destroyed by unprecedented rains.The past was so beautiful and glorious! Sadly the present is so terribly, agonizingly miserable.The rise of environmental issues has led to much poverty and sorrow in my part of the world. Rising sea levels have caused sheer destruction, which has resulted in salt water coming inland and affecting the paddy fields and crops. Landslides have occurred more frequently due to increase in torrential rains and the blockage of food transportation. Cancer and ill health have been on the rise. These are just some of the issues we've faced as an island in the Indian Ocean.Just like when bombs, chaos and death were so common in Sri Lanka during the civil war, environmental disasters have become so common here. Sadly, after a period of time, these various harbingers of death lose their novelty and we do not have the energy to herald them. Young people today wouldn't know that there used to be two seasons when it rained! They would never know that crops grew during those times naturally, and that we had plenty of organic food to eat.The danger lies in going with the flow. Not paying attention to the changes. We cannot afford to not notice and take action. Why? Because that's where we lost earlier, where we gave in to the fossil fuels, gave in to the forest depletions in the name of development and gave up our humanity by cutting down the very trees that gave us the breath of life.The stark future of climate change will be this. Our action now shapes our future.We have all played our part in creating these environmental issues, be it by clearing out lands for development or by creating companies that pollute our water-ways resulting in chronic kidney diseases. By creating chemicals that poison us through our food and skins or by using fossil fuels carelessly leading to massive biohazards like Deepwater Horizon.We forgot to pay attention to our environment! We forgot the very place we live in; the environment we utilize to support our existence. The repercussions of these actions will haunt us and generations yet to come.Yes, for the past 20 years, there have been movements to change things. However, as always, people do not seem to realize their power. We have the power! Young people have toppled dictatorial governments and have changed nations for the better. This year we are stronger than ever!The people of Holland are suing their own country for failing to keep up its carbon emission cuts, citing human rights. There are ways to take actions -- be it through a campaign to rally other young people, be it press coverage, or be it a massive movement for policy changes. We cannot lose hope now. Our future depends on us.The deeper question is whether we are going to continue playing that part. Are we going to watch our future fade away into nothing but a dusty dead planet as witnessed in the movie Interstellar? Or, are we going to do the best we can to save ourselves and our future generations from a certain deadly future?The choice has and will always be ours.It is time to take action.

Despite the fact that the oil companies' expertise is to drill a hole and collect the oil that comes out, BP couldn't figure out how to stop the oil from coming out of the hole. For nearly three months we watched oil-soaked pelicans, turtles and dolphins. The livelihoods of fishermen dried up.What did we learn? Al Jazeera recently reported that there have been more than 1,500 new drilling permits issued for the Gulf since April 20, 2010. Congress has refused to pass new safety regulations, essentially saying to the people of the Gulf -- and the rest of us -- here's our middle finger.On a good day in the gulf -- This is what East Coast marshes will look like if drilling is allowed. Photo -- C. SafinaThe Deepwater Horizon tragedy is just one reason why we need to begin turning our back on the petroleum era. Disasters like tanker spills and blowouts get the headlines by killing everything from dolphins to tourism. But mainly it's the underwater noise of seismic exploration and associated confusion, the bloated ports, smelly air; the accelerated tanker traffic, increased overland oil shipping, the day-to-day spills and chronic leaks that all contribute to the erosion of wildlife, habitats, natural beauty and safe waters wherever oil is the thing. The Associated Press recently reported that a Gulf oil platform has been leaking since 2004. According to outside experts, that leak could be at the source of the largest spill ever in the Gulf. Daily leaks, minor spills and associated infrastructure are eating away at our coastlines and chipping away at our most special places. The greatest food-producing wildlife habitat of the United States -- the Mississippi Delta -- has already lost more than 2,300 square miles of wetlands, largely from about 10,000 miles of man-made canals cut through its forests and marshes, much of which are there to facilitate oil business, and all else be damned.Ask the people of the Gulf, or Alaska's Prince William Sound, or the Niger Delta or any of hundreds of places worldwide that are afflicted by the blight of oil extraction and processing, and they'll tell you that there is no such thing as oil spill cleanup. Once oil development has started, the battle has been lost, because accidents will happen.Accidents happen -- Try cleaning this up in the icy Arctic night. Photo -- C. SafinaYet despite the guaranteed catastrophes and the daily corrosion of death by a thousand cuts that we see wherever oil and water mix, the Obama administration is ready to open up 80 percent of our coast to drilling and development, including the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean coasts where drilling has never been allowed. Obama's energy policy is \"all of the above.\" But if you've read this far, my policy is: none of the above. We're literally sick of it.We can't allow what happened in the Gulf to happen to the fishing, turtles, dolphins, marshes and tourism of the Carolinas and Georgia. It took months to stop a well in the warm waters of the Gulf, where every possible ship and fabrication facility, helicopters -- the works -- could easily be deployed. What do they think will happen in the Arctic Ocean, where addressing an oil spill or blowout in the shrieking storms and 20-foot swells and battering ice and months-long darkness is impossible. It's madness to imagine managing an accident there.Yet, Shell Oil Company continues its reckless pursuit of permission to prick the Arctic Ocean, willing to put the entire region in jeopardy, while bean counters figure out the dollar-pricing of death to polar bears and walruses.How do we know we don't really need this oil? Because the oil companies are lobbying like hell to be allowed to export it. In their unpatriotic multinational way, they are willing to risk America the beautiful and our health for more zeroes on their ledgers. It's insane, but what alternatives do we have?It is time to stop oil development and drilling in our special places. It is time to release us from being the oil hostages we have become. It's time to stop having our tax monies -- never enough for better schools -- subsidizing oil companies so their treasonous lobbyists can corrupt Congress and install the best puppets money can buy.Over the Gulf in 2010 -- The only value of what I saw is my resolve to see it nowhere else, ever again. Photo -- C SafinaInstead we need to move toward the clean energy future that we will have to build when the oil runs out. Well, the easy oil is gone. Now is the time we need to harness and scale up the energies that actually power life on this planet: the sun, the force of wind, the strength of tides, the heat of the earth itself. The jobs we get are the jobs we plan for. Anyone who says we need oil from the East Coast and the indefensible Arctic Ocean lacks vision. Anyone who says we can't do much, much better is either ignorant or lying.They were lying in 2010 as I watched BP's oil stain our Gulf and people's lives. I never want to see what I saw ever again, anywhere."}, {"title": "Flower Power: Electricity From Plants", "text": "By Don WilllmottDon Willmott is a New York-based journalist who writes about technology, travel and the environment for a wide variety of publications and websites.It may sound like an idea dreamed up at Woodstock with the help of some mind-altering substances, but researchers are finding ways to tap into the power of photosynthesis to generate at least small amounts of electricity. As it turns out, plants are more efficient than they need to be, and they disperse excess energy that we can collect. Are we talking about megawatts from marigolds? Not exactly, but beyond the raw science are practical applications that shouldn't be dismissed out of hand.Dutch researchers at Wageningen University first patented the process of collecting plant power in 2007, and today those patents are in the hands of a Netherlands-based company called Plant-e, which is trying hard to productize the natural processes that make it all happen.What's actually going on down there in the dirt? In photosynthesis, a plant's leaves absorb sunlight and blend its energy with water and carbon dioxide to make the sugars on which the plant feeds. What's interesting is that the plant usually makes too much, dispersing perhaps half of its food into the soil. Once there, bacteria break down the sugars, and protons and electrons are among the resulting byproducts.Plant-e's idea is to insert a conductor into the soil to collect the electrons, which are then turned into electricity. The company says the process doesn't interrupt plant growth; the plants just continue to reach for the sky. It's renewable and sustainable. The only glitch: the process doesn't work when the ground freezes.So let's talk numbers. Plant-e says that a one-square-meter garden should be able to produce 28 kilowatt-hours per year, which means that an average American house might be able to be powered by several thousand square feet of active growth. That's not practical, but there are countless places around the world where people live in much smaller homes and have much lower energy demands. And many of the 1.4 billion people worldwide who don't have access to electricity are active farmers or gardeners.Plant-e also has its eye on temperate wetlands, peat bogs, mangrove swamps, river deltas, and rice paddies where it could generate power at scale for things like Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile chargers, and nighttime lighting to provide real benefits in poorer locales. For cities, Plant-e is testing modular green rooftop systems, 15 square meters of which would be enough to charge a cell phone. That may not sound exactly earth-shattering, but every little bit helps.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+, and get our Newsletter to stay informed."}, {"title": "China's National Coal Cap Policy Could Save Nearly 50,000 Lives and $6.2 Billion Every Year by 2020", "text": "China's proposed national policies to curb coal use will provide enormous air quality and health benefits to the public and coal industry workers, saving 49,000 lives and $6.2 billion in 2020, according to a new study (Chinese version here) released by the China Coal Cap Project, a joint initiative of academic, governmental and non-profit researchers, with the support of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and World Wildlife Foundation (WWF).The study examines the public health impacts of a national coal cap policy that caps coal consumption in 2020 at 4.1 billion tons of coal, compared to a business-as-usual scenario in which China's annual coal consumption continues to grow to 4.8 billion tons of coal in 2030. The report estimates that air pollution from coal use led to approximately 708,000 premature deaths in China in 2012 due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. The air quality improvements from a national coal cap policy would save approximately 49,000 lives per year in 2020, 89,000 in 2030, 80,000 in 2040 and 51,000 in 2050, leading to economic benefits of $6.2 billion, $11.4 billion, $10.2 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. The graph below shows the estimated premature deaths (in units of 10,000 persons) from ambient PM 2.5 air pollution attributable to coal through 2050, with the reference scenario in red and the coal cap scenario in green.Source: \"Coal Consumption Cap and Public Health Impacts and Avoidable Costs\" presentationThe study also analyzed the impacts of a coal cap policy on the occupational health and mortality of coal mining and production workers, finding that a national coal cap policy would prevent approximately 800-1,400 cases of lung disease among coal mining and production workers per year between 2020 to 2050 and approximately 180-260 premature deaths per year from 2030 to 2050. 24,206 cases of occupation-related pneumoconiosis disease were reported in 2012, with 55 percent of these occurring in the coal mining and production sector.The coal cap health study builds on prior analysis by the China Coal Cap Project which finds that coal combustion and utilization was responsible for about 62 percent of particulate matter (PM 2.5), 93 percent of sulfur dioxide (SOand 70 percent of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution in China in 2012. The China Coal Cap Project also previously found (Chinese report) the environmental and health costs from coal production, transportation and utilization amounted to 260 RMB ($43) per ton in 2012. In order to mitigate these environmental and health costs, the project recommends implementation of a national coal consumption cap target and policy in the next Five Year Plan, and the use of increasing resource, environmental and carbon taxes (Chinese report) to account for the environmental and health costs of coal.China is already leading the way in global renewable energy investment, having invested $89.5 billion in wind, solar and other renewables in 2014. Increasing investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency can help it to achieve a permanent capping and reduction of its total coal consumption as early as possible, while adding hundreds of thousands of jobs in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The recent 2050 high renewable energy penetration study led by the China National Renewable Energy Center charts a similar path (see below), in which aggressive wind and solar development can lead to a peaking of coal consumption by 2020 and carbon emissions by 2025, with renewables accounting for more than 60 percent of China's primary energy and 85 percent of its electricity by 2050.Source: 2050 High Renewable Energy Penetration Scenario and Roadmap Study, China National Renewable Energy CenterThe health, economic and job benefits of capping coal consumption by greatly expanding renewable energy and energy efficiency are clear, and China is currently making strong efforts to speed up its clean energy transition. Setting an aggressive mandatory national coal cap target in the 13 Five Year Plan that comes out next March, and laying out a detailed policy roadmap for achieving it, will be important next steps in making these goals a reality.This blog was coauthored by NRDC China Climate and Energy Project Director Alvin Lin."}, {"title": "Strong Arctic Leadership Can Make a Difference at the Top of the World", "text": "Caption: Credit: Kathryn Hansen / NASA. The Arctic is warming at twice the global average.When Secretary of State John Kerry took the Arctic Council chair on Thursday from Canada, the United States began an exciting opportunity to lead the world in advancing environmental safeguards across the Arctic, while slowing warming and ice melt that threaten the region and our planet.The Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum of Arctic governments and indigenous people, has been critical in promoting cooperation in the region. The Council needs to move faster and more boldly to meet the growing threats to the region, especially in addressing climate change.The U.S. agenda for the next two years sets ambitious objectives in three thematic areas: Arctic Ocean stewardship, such as establishing marine protected areas to build resilience to warming and acidification, improving living conditions for northern communities, including village renewable energy projects, and a focus on climate change. If we want to meet these objectives, we must strengthen the Council as an effective intergovernmental forum for this iconic and critical region.We can do this with strong leadership on an issue high on the U.S. climate agenda -- reducing black carbon emissions. These releases are a major component of soot, which settles on ice and snow, accelerating melting. Reducing these emissions from all sources, especially from the Arctic countries themselves, would be a significant step toward slowing glacier melt, a major contributor to sea level rise, in a region warming at twice the global average.Credit: Xenotar / Shutterstock. As global recognition of the importance of the Arctic grows, the time is now for U.S. leadership in addressing global warming pollution.To date, Arctic nations have negotiated agreements like search and rescue and offshore oil spill response. A landmark Framework for Action on Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emissions Reductions will be adopted this week. Under it, Arctic nations commit to enhancing national and regional action to reduce black carbon emissions overall. The Framework sets up the U.S. chairmanship to spur the adoption of best practices, help set ambitious regional emissions reduction goals, and deliver strong recommendations to achieve even greater reductions going forward. This week the Council will also endorse the Framework Plan for Cooperation on Prevention of Oil Pollution from oil development and ship spills, complementing its oil spill response agreement signed in 2013. These are critical accomplishments.If we are willing to lead at home, the U.S. chairmanship will be most effective. The country is on a path toward bigger, riskier and dirtier Arctic drilling, which will further stress the region's wildlife and communities while worsening climate change. For the region and world's sake, the U.S. needs to lead by saying no to Arctic drilling.U.S. leadership comes at a critical time.Since its 1996 inception, the Council has evolved into a forum that can develop pan-Arctic policies and the necessary agreements to implement them. Still, the Council can only move as fast as its member states are willing. As global recognition of the importance of this region grows, the time is now for U.S. leadership in addressing global warming pollution, while adopting safeguards to meet the Arctic's growing challenges.Credit: Karen E.

In 2013, runoff was at 47 percent of normal.The lake's levels are nearing a critical trigger where federal officials will have to start rationing water deliveries to Nevada, Arizona and parts of California. States in the region have enacted action plans to lessen greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.A study carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation and the seven states in the Colorado river basin concluded that the drought was not likely to end soon, and that large metropolitan cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix grew rapidly during a rare wetter period for the river.On average, the Colorado River Basin temperature is projected to increase by five to six F degrees during the 21st century, the report said. Mean annual runoff is projected to decrease by 8.5 percent by 2050.

Energy is no exception. That is why I was pleased to recently attend a conference of the American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE). While in attendance, however, I developed concerns that workshops did not address issues facing African American families that are directly attributable to our nation's reliance on fossil fuel energy sources.The NAACP developed a report that shows how fossil fuels play a significantly harmful role in the health of African Americans and other communities of color. Segregation and economic deprivation has forced generations of African American families to live in some of the least desirable areas. More than two-thirds of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal plant. This puts our community at a much greater risk for the health problems associated with exposure to the toxic chemicals these plants spew. African American children are three times as likely to be admitted to the hospital for, and twice as likely to die from, asthma as compared to white children.Regrettably, a discussion of the harmful impact of fossil fuel pollution on communities of color was noticeably absent from the conference's proceedings. What is worse is that many speakers denigrated one of the best solutions to the pollution problems plaguing African American communities: renewable energy sources such as solar.The conference was an opportunity to educate attendees about the costs and benefits of ALL energy sources. Unfortunately, attendees may have left with a skewed perception. Although numerous independent studies have shown that solar energy provides benefits to all electricity consumers on the grid, fossil fuel utilities were pushing a deceptive argument that misrepresents the benefits of solar energy to communities of color. The utility companies' thinly veiled attempts to present clean energy sources as a racial issue was shameful. It became clear that their real motivation was shaping a discourse that protects energy monopolies.Fortunately, people like Reverend Nelson Johnson of Faith Community Church in Greensboro, North Carolina, see through and are calling out the inaccuracies propagated by utilities. Reverend Johnson recently co-authored an open letter to the CEO of Duke Energy to \"Stop Targeting African Americans with Your Anti-Solar Campaign.\" He talked about having been visited three times by people pushing propaganda that \"solar hurts the poor.\" The Reverend questioned the motives behind Duke Energy's attacks on solar and called on the utility to stop \"this duplicitous corporate behavior.\"Apparently, the establishment of a cleaner alternative is a threat to the status quo and a threat to the utility companies' domination of the energy market. While these fossil fuel companies continue to pollute the air above and the land surrounding our communities, they are intent on sustaining our dependence on them through placing misleading campaigns to slow the growth of a viable and pollution-free alternative.

The Indian initiative means there are now four specific phase-down proposals under discussion - including ones from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, from Micronesia, and from the European Union. China also supports an HFC phase-down. Curbing HFCs also has the support of the entire African bloc and nearly all Latin American, Asian, and small island nations. (NRDC and our partners have put together a fact sheet on the four proposals.)HFCs are manufactured chemicals used in air conditioning and other applications. They have up to 10,800 times the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide, on a pound for pound basis. And they are the fastest growing climate-changing pollutants, on pace to make up as much as a quarter of the heat-trapping pollution in the atmosphere by mid-century.The Bangkok meeting began with a two-day workshop documenting rapid progress in developing new low-impact coolants and air conditioning equipment to use them. Solutions are on the market or under development for nearly every HFC application. An HFC phase-down agreement will send the market signals needed for full-scale deployment of the solutions.The Bangkok meeting showed the broad support that has developed in the six years since the North American and small island countries introduced the first HFC phase-down proposals in 2009. The biggest developing countries - China, India, and Brazil - are ready to engage. And the African Group - all 54 nations on the continent - is united in driving the process forward.But the meeting also showed that not everyone is onboard. Saudi Arabia and a small group of clients - including Kuwait, Pakistan, and Bahrain - prevented actual negotiations from getting under way, just as they had at the last meeting in November 2014. Specifically, they opposed forming a \"contact group,\" the formal vehicle for hammering out solutions to specific problems.The Montreal Protocol's tradition of action by consensus, while usually a source of strength, turns into a major obstacle when the majority is ready to move but a few countries are dissatisfied.Saudi Arabia struck a defiant tone through much of the meeting. \"We will never agree in one year, five years, or 100 years\" to start these negotiations, declared Taha Zatari, the chief Saudi delegate on Thursday. Frustrations boiled over on Friday morning, when Senegal, speaking on behalf of the entire African Group, accused Saudi Arabia of \"blocking\" - tough talk in a diplomatic setting.On the surface, the Saudis have a plausible complaint: It's really hot in our part of the world, and we need to be sure that we will have new air conditioning technologies before committing to new requirements.The fallacy of the Saudi position is that none of the HFC phase-down proposals would require countries with hot climates to curb HFC use now. All of the HFC proposals contemplate that developing countries will act after developed countries, with financial assistance from the Protocol's Multilateral Fund.It is easy to imagine a schedule for developing country reductions that provides plenty of time before HFC reductions kick in. And to add special provisions that allow extra time, if needed, to perfect alternatives for air conditioning in very high temperatures.Countries backing an HFC phase-down made it crystal clear that they are open to these solutions. But the Saudis are having trouble taking \"yes\" for an answer.Clearly concerned about being tagged as \"blockers,\" the Saudis softened their stance Friday afternoon. They agreed to holding an \"intersessional\" meeting in the next two months, \"with a view toward establishing a contact group\" on HFC proposals at the next negotiating session in Paris in July. Only a small concession, but movement nonetheless.And so the Bangkok meeting achieved its minimum objectives: solidifying support for acting on HFCs and inching the process forward.Nearly every country will come to Paris in July ready to roll up its sleeves and start hammering out an agreement. A landmark HFC deal could be reached as early as November, when the Montreal Protocol parties meet in Dubai.An HFC phase-down agreement would be a big deal in its own right, and it would be a shot in the arm towards the bigger climate change deal countries are seeking to reach in Paris in December.But the Saudis can still block the process.

They're important facilities -- accommodating travelers' often urgent bathroom needs. But they're guzzling copious quantities of what is fast becoming the state's most sacred resource -- WATER.Dunnigan rest stop on State Highway 5 north of Sacramento services about two thousand people a day. These daily visitors flush away four to five thousand gallons of water.But soon Dunnigan will operate with a closed loop wastewater system In other words all the black water -- aka sewage -- is rigorously filtered and then recycled to flush toilets and urinals... again, and again and again.For a water-supply-challenged rest stop in a thirsty state, self-replenishing flush water is a spot of good news in an otherwise bleak drought forecast.Caltrans Senior Sanitary Engineer, Jerry Marcott, says the Dunnigan prototype is just the beginning -- with additional facilities under consideration for closed-loop modification within the next 5-10 years.But there's another facet of Dunnigan's sustainable wastewater system that gets environmental geeks such as myself all tingly with optimism -- the media used in the filtration tanks is none other than environmental enemy #2 -- PLASTIC.Plastic is a petrochemical polymer -- meaning it's made from oil. While it has given our lives a veneer of convenient disposability, we are surrounded on all sides by oceans and waterways awash in plastic waste. Recycling all the plastic effectively is impossible and with plastic production set to quadruple by 2050, let's hope someone's got a plan.Bringing us back to sewage.Turns out, shredded plastic offers the perfect high surface area to volume ratio that wastewater treatment facilities need. Sewage has an indigenous microbial system that devours its own pathogens. That is, given enough surface area for its bacteria to colonize, and black water cleans itself.Various plastics have been used as filtration media in large municipal wastewater treatment systems for 50 years. But large systems also require other more rigorous filtration methods. The design beauty of Dunnigan is its simplicity. As a compact small-scale treatment plant -- it'll only need the plastic, ponds and a final pumice (volcanic rock) filtration.Dunnigan is also noteworthy, because it was the testing site for a self-contained plastic media wastewater system that could be a major advancement in the developing world. There's one already successfully in place in Kibera -- a slum in Kenya.There are masses of single use plastic bottles littering Kenya because people don't trust local tap water. So Kibera project designer, Norm Hantzsche, President of Questa Engineering, had a two-fold goal: provide sanitation and flushing toilets to a community desperately in need of them, while reducing the blight of plastic trash.Caltrans allowed U.C Davis scientists to run the Dunnigan wastewater system for eight months with plastic bottles, which had to be shredded by hand.The plastic bottles were later changed out for Polypropylene (PP) plastic, the media Dunnigan's modified to utilize long term. PP is industrially pre-shredded and treated, so far less labor intensive than bottles.According to Captain Charles Moore, who discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- the floating soup of plastic trash in the Northern Pacific Ocean -- it is high time for us to re-think plastic.Moore states we must \"design recyclability into plastic products, leaving the age of extinction going instead into the age of re-use.\"Dunnigan rest stop using four hundred cubic feet of 100 percent recycled polypropylene plastic, and Africa's largest urban slum having 15 flushing toilets thanks to a local resource of discarded plastic bottles, are great examples of reincarnated plastic.Hantzsche says, \"repurposing is now a higher use than recycling\" and that even here in the U.S peoples' eyes light up when he talks about wastewater treatment utilizing plastic bottles.It's a promising sign in a country where two and a half million plastic bottles are thrown away hourly.Hantzsche and his Californian engineering team have another recycled plastic/water conservation idea on the design table -- a single-family-home grey water recycling unit, that would use up to 500 plastic water bottles.Proliferation of these small and large-scale wastewater and plastic repurposing projects is the only way forward. In fact repurposing water is already happening in California and other water stressed places in ways some of us don't want to think about -- toilet to tap.But every drop of recycled water will be needed in a world predicted to experience more frequent and severe drought.So a symbiotic solution to two escalating environmental problems -- plastic and drought -- can only be good news on Earth Week.

The national average is 0.5 percent of households.Mark Glick, the Hawaii State Energy Office energy administrator, said that economically speaking, the bill makes sense. Energy available from Hawaii’s numerous renewable sources “competes favorably today with the cost of oil,” he said, making a 100 percent goal “both lofty and achievable.”“We increased our renewable portfolio standards in 2009 to current levels,” Glick said. The state set a goal of getting 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2015.Today, Hawaii is close to 23 percent, he noted, “and 2015 isn’t finished yet.”Given that pace, the bill's proposal seems realistic. It establishes goals of 25 percent of electricity sales to be renewable by 2020, 40 percent by 2030, 70 percent by 2035 and 100 percent by 2050, “unless the acquisition of renewable energy is not beneficial to Hawaii’s economy.”Dawn Lippert, the founder of the Honolulu-based Energy Excelerator and chair of the board of the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, said that establishing stretch goals are “very powerful tools to get stakeholders to align to action. When we set that [2030] goal, many people thought that it couldn’t be done by 2030. And now what we see is really significant momentum in steps toward that goal. We’re farther along that path than we thought we would be.”The Pakini Nui wind farm generates energy near South Point Bay on the Island of Hawaii.Hawaii has at least 50 renewable energy projects spread over five islands, including the state’s only geothermal plant on the eastern rift zone of the Kilauea volcano.Thanks in large part to that geothermal plant, Hawaii Island (also known as the Big Island) is running on nearly 50 percent renewable energy. The plant produces electricity that is cheaper than petroleum fuels in Hawaii and generally cheaper than other forms of renewable electricity.A Puna Geothermal board operator makes adjustments to regulate the steam pressure that produces electricity from the facility.Not everyone in Hawaii, however, is on board with the renewable energy goals. Big hotels in Waikiki and other resort areas, for instance, use generators powered by natural gas as a way to cut their electricity bills.Honolulu Civil Beat reported that a director for Starwood Hawaii wrote in opposition testimony to the measure that self-generators are an efficient way to produce electricity from fossil fuels and benefit customers with a \"dramatic reduction in overall energy costs.\"Hotels along Waikiki beach.While Hawaii's plan is incredibly ambitious because it would encompass an entire state, it isn't the only place in the U.S. with a goal of going 100 percent renewable.The city of San Francisco aims to have its electricity grid go fully renewable by 2020, and San Diego’s goal is 2035.Globally, Iceland is already using 100 percent renewable energy, and Scotland and Denmark also have similar goals in place.But Lippert emphasizes that for her, this isn’t a race to be first.“As global citizens, we want everybody in this race. Fossil fuels and clean energy are global challenges and we’re all better off if everybody’s headed in this direction,” she said."}, {"title": "100% Renewable Energy: The new normal?", "text": "It's not always easy to find examples of what's working in the fight against climate change, but a shining one is the growing global movement for 100% renewable energy.The most optimistic predictions for the UN COP21 climate negotiations in Paris at the end of this year center on an \"80 by 50\" scenario -- a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. In my opinion, that scenario is less a call-to-action than a call-to-arms. Previous global negotiations have shown that as long as there is any percentage of fossil-fuel energy left on the table, countries will fight for access to it, and productive discussions will come to an end. So we need to change the narrative. Instead of a call-to-arms, we need a doctrine of \"mutually assured survival\" -- a doctrine in which all commit to the goal of 100% renewable energy.Since 2013, renewable energies have been winning the race against fossil resources: the world is now adding more capacity for renewable power each year than for coal, natural gas, and oil combined. The question is no longer if the world will transition to sustainable energy, but how long it will take. And there's no going back.This transition is being driven largely by local governments.A growing numbers of cities, communities and regions are proving that meeting 100% of our energy demand with renewable energy is viable. As urban areas are responsible for 70-75% of energy related CO2 emissions and 40-50% of global GHG emissions, this is an encouraging trend. My city -- Vancouver, Canada -- recently voted in favor of a target of 100% renewable energy.100% RE Is Already a Reality TodayOther cities and states -- from Hawaii and Georgetown, Texas, in the USA to Coffs Harbour in Australia -- have already shown that making the transition to 100% renewable energy is a political, not technical, decision. The necessary technology and knowledge exists.In Germany, in a network of 140 100% RE regions, 80 communities and municipalities have already reached their goal. One of them is the Rhein-Hunsrück District. As of early 2012, the District, which has around 100,000 inhabitants, officially began producing more than 100% of its electricity needs. In early 2014, it is estimated that Rhein-Hunsrück already produced more than 230% of its total electricity needs, exporting the surplus to the regional and national grid, or re-directing it to meet other energy demands.The city of Greensburg (Kansas, USA) powers all local homes and businesses with 100% renewable energy, 100% of the time. The story of Greensburg is one of tragedy to triumph: a tornado destroyed or damaged 95% of the town's homes and businesses on May 4, 2007. The community -- with a strong leader in Mayor Bob Dixon -- turned disaster into opportunity and created a vision to rebuild Greensburg as a sustainable community.Building efficiency and local wind, complemented by small solar installations and biogas, are the cornerstones of their master plan. The town has gathered a diverse group of experts to make their vision a reality.Similarly, local governments across Japan are seeking to supply their regions with 100% renewable energy. The Great East Japan earthquake, the subsequent tsunami and the disaster at the Fukushima-daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011, encouraged the people of Fukushima to reassess their energy system and to revitalize industry in the shattered region. This led to a vision of transition to renewable energy. Fukushima prefecture now has an official commitment to cover 100% of primary-energy demand in Fukushima with renewable resources by 2040.Joining them are another 13 cities or regions that have registered a 100% renewable-energy target in the carbonn Climate Registry:· Province of Siena (Italy) · Copenhagen (Denmark) · Kristianstad and Oslo (Norway) · Malmö, Saffle and Stockholm (Sweden) · Cincinnati, Grand Rapids, Hillsboro, Palmerston North, San Francisco and Santa Cruz County (USA)The 100% RE NetworkThis energy transformation is already unstoppable but will go at the pace we need when we can ensure it's \"people centered\" and \"community driven.\" The Global 100% RE Alliance has provided a set of guidelines for governments to help ensure that this transformation will indeed serve the needs of the people and facilitate \"the required system change.\" Based on these guidelines, ICLEI and the Global 100% RE Alliance have launched a new 100% RE network for local governments, to strengthen understanding within local governments on what 100% RE means and how to reach it fairly.Whether the goal is to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases; to increase energy safety, security and energy independence; or to alleviate energy poverty, the solution is 100% clean renewable energy. We spent 10 years arguing over whether climate change was happening and then we spent another 10 years arguing over what we should do if it is happening; now we're getting down to the who and when. The 100% RE network gives us the opportunity to be the \"who\" by signing on.

The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, feeds on soft tissues of bats such as their wings and noses.Little Brown Bat with white-nose syndrome  Credit: Jonathan Mays, Wildlife Biologist, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and WildlifeWhite Nose Syndrome was first discovered in Haile's Cave at John Boyd Thacher State Park by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation during a routine bat survey in March 2007. The earliest evidence of the disease in North America can be seen in photographs taken by a cave hydrologist at Howe Caverns in Schoharie County, New York in the winter of 2006. New York State DEC states that since March 2007 \"we discovered the disease in every hibernation site in New York in which we have looked for it.\" The U.S. Fish & Wildlife estimates a death toll between 5-7 million bats based on the most recent survey conducted in 2012.Impacts of the disease on hibernating bats have varied between species. According to the NYS DEC, \"the Northern long-eared bat and the tri-colored bat are most impacted. Observed declines for these species exceed 95 percent on a statewide basis. The little brown bat, once very common, has declined about 90 percent. The Indian bat, a species that was considered endangered even prior to white-nose, has been slightly less affected as a percentage, exhibiting perhaps 70 percent decline statewide.\"Bats exhibiting Pseudogymnoascus destructans fungus on their muzzles. This fungus causes WNS in bats. Photo Courtesy of Nancy Heaslip, New York Department of Environmental ConservationMichelle Verant, Post Doc at the USGS National Wildlife Center at the University of Wisconsin, published a study this past December on how the disease progresses from initial infection to mortality in bats. Verant states \"bats have reduced immune function in hibernation, making them susceptible to the disease.\" The study found that the fungus fluctuates in growth substantially based on temperature with ideal conditions between 12-15 degrees Celsius (53-59 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions also happen to be the body temperature range of most bats during hibernation. The fungus inhibits the bat's ability to release CO2 from their bodies. Verant attributes the increased energy use during infection to high levels of built up CO2 found in infected bats. She states, \"as the fungus feeds on the bats soft tissues, it increases the metabolic rate of the bats compounded with the damage to the wings that aid in passive release of CO2 from the bat.\" The spike in C02 levels in the bats causes them to hyperventilate, increasing arousal frequencies during hibernation, leading to fatal starvation.The fungus most likely originated in Europe. Jeff Foster of the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, is one of the leading researchers genetically tracing the origins of the fungus. His lab results have demonstrated that the North American strain and European strains of the fungus do not produce mortality in European bats, but both do so in North American bats. Based on his findings, Foster hypothesizes that episodes of mass mortality in European bat populations have historically occurred until bats developed immunity to the disease and that small numbers of surviving bats in North America will likely do the same. He states \"the genetic testing of the fungus in Europe suggests that is has existed there for millennia, whereas the North American variation of the fungus strongly suggests it was introduced very recently as very little genetic variability has occurred.\" Foster and many other researchers suspect that the fungus was brought over from Europe inadvertently on cave gear or clothing. This suspicion has led to strict regulations on cave access throughout potentially affected areas.At Mammoth Cave National Park, White Nose Syndrome has affected the visitor procedures for entering and leaving the caves since the emergence of the disease in New York.According to Rickard S. Toomey III, Director of Mammoth Cave International Center for Science and Learning,From 2008 until the winter of 2010-2011, park efforts on White Nose Syndrome spread prevention focused on keeping people from bringing the fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome into park caves. Visitors were screened to see if they had visited other caves since 2005. Those that had were asked about their shoes and clothing. If necessary, shoes were treated with a cleaning solution to kill any fungal spores that might be on them.In 2011, the existence of White Nose Syndrome was confirmed in the state of Kentucky, and the park's precautionary efforts extended to requiring all visitors who went on walking tours to sanitize their shoes on bio-security mats in case the fungus existed at the park undetected. From 2011 until Spring 2014, spread prevention efforts simultaneously targeted preventing the fungus from coming to the park with people and preventing people from leaving the park with viable fungus (in case it was already there, but undetected).By spring 2014, White Nose Syndrome was confirmed on tour routes. Toomey states \"since 2014, primary concern with spread has been to minimize potential for visitors to spread the fungus to other sites after visiting Mammoth Cave.\"Some colonial bat roosts in the park have been closed to most access, to reduce potentially spreading the disease and exacerbating the disease in infected bats. On cave crawling tours Toomey states, \"we no longer allow people to use their own caving gear. The park supplies coveralls, pads, helmets, lights, and gloves. These gear are only used on these tours and do not leave the park. Visitors use their own boots, but the boots are cleaned following the tours. The gear restriction addresses both the potential for people to accidentally bring the fungus into the cave and keeps people from leaving with it, now that the fungus is here.\" The gear and access restrictions, according to Toomey, have not significantly impacted park attendance.National White Nose Syndrome Coordinator at U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Jeremy Coleman, was a graduate research assistant at Cornell University when White Nose Syndrome first emerged. In 2008, a meeting in Albany, New York brought together Federal, State, Non-Government and research organizations to develop a response plan to the epidemic. The Northeast Regional U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in Hadley, Massachusetts was designated the lead in overseeing the National response. According to Coleman,\"The disease is still advancing and has been confirmed in 25 U.S. States and five Canadian Provinces to date, with pending lab results that may add another three states to that map. Bats can travel hundreds of miles from their roosting sites, so the impacts of the disease affect their entire range and not just the counties in which their roosting/hibernating sites reside. The disease isn't going away anytime soon.\"Reports of the disease have decreased this year in the Midwest, but Director of Imperiled Species at Bat Conservation International Katie Gillies states, \"the decrease in the Midwest is due to bat movement patterns rather than any actual decline in the spread of White Nose Syndrome.\" Gillies cites the biggest breakthrough in fighting the disease of recent has been the research on creating a biological control for the disease.Possible hope for the bats is in development. At Georgia State University's Crow Laboratory, Chris Cornelison was conducting research with the bacteria Rhodococcus to delay the ripening of fruit. His findings showed a significant decrease in fungal growth on the fruit and he was curious as to whether it could produce the same results on bats infected with White Nose Syndrome. In conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, his research has demonstrated that the bacteria stop germination of the fungus on bat tissue without any negative effects. His team developed a nebulizer to distribute the bacteria at a very low cost and recently conducted a field trial at four sites in Kentucky. Cornelison states that \"the field trial results have yet to be published, but regardless of how well it works, the diverse environments that bats inhabit throughout North America call for a diversity of tools needed to combat White Nose Syndrome so that the resource management of each particular jurisdiction can utilize the right tool to mitigate the impacts of the disease for each specific ecosystem.\"Official White Nose Syndrome Website http://www.whitenosesyndrome.org"}, {"title": "These Flies Are Getting More Action Than You", "text": "We're sorry.

Getty photographer Nicholas Kamm captured these aroused arthropods in Washington, DC on Thursday.Flies' mating habits look surprisingly human. Male flies will usually approach a female from behind, sometimes in mid-air, but usually while both parties are on a solid surface, according to a 1964 paper on the breeding habits of the insects. After the initial \"strike,\" things get interesting:The male now reaches forward and strokes or \"caresses\" the head of the female with his prothoracic legs, which have been moved from their position on the wing base. It should be kept in mind that this reaching forward by the male occurs simultaneously with the outward movement of the female's wings. Some pressure appears to be exerted, for the female's head is forced down.A 2009 study also noted that female fruit flies fight to keep sex short and sweet, while males want it to last longer, according to National Geographic. \"After about a minute and a half [of mating], the female begins kicking and struggling,\" co-author Kirsten Klappert told the outlet.Saucy.Let it be noted that George Carlin was very wrong.

Climate change is a reality and current and future generations are up against the greatest challenge that humanity has ever faced. Yet some people believe that there is a trade-off between combating climate change and delivering development for the people. Around this year's Earth Day, it is time to explode this harmful myth. It's time to accept that the key to dealing with both poverty and climate change is energy security. And that energy security can be achieved without fossil fuels.On a global level renewable energy is winning the race against fossil fuels as more clean-power capacity is being installed than coal, oil and gas together. Solar power is growing faster than even we at Greenpeace predicted, and renewables are now the cheapest way to provide more electricity in an ever-growing number of countries.Dharnai, a solar-powered village in India, shows how we can make the renewables boom deliver for all -- including the rural poor. Dharnai is located in Bihar, one of the poorest provinces in India. It did not have access to electricity for 30 years before a solar mini-grid was installed with the support of Greenpeace India in July last year.The village faces extreme poverty, deep caste divisions and very high illiteracy rates. But life in Dharnai has been transformed in the last 10 months since an affordable solar-energy grid arrived. Dharnai is the first village in India where all aspects of life are powered by solar. The 100-kilowatt (kW) system powers the 450 homes of the 2,400 residents, 50 commercial operations, two schools, a training center and a health-care facility. A battery backup ensures power is available around the clock.Solar-powered lighting means children can now go out and play after school and finish their homework after sunset. Women feel safer venturing out after dark and families at home do not have to spend time in darkness. The arrival of solar-powered water pumps has brought new hope to many farmers in improving access to fresh-water resources. With solar energy, more villagers have been able to recharge their mobile phones regularly, and so the solar grid has also opened up Dharnai to the world of the Internet.This is just the beginning. Improvements in the quality of life of Dharnai's residents have become the talk of neighboring villages that are eager to understand and replicate the Dharnai model. India has 80,000 other villages that also need solar micro-grids.That is why it is so important that Greenpeace India continues to work for a better life for India's citizens and to help deliver clean, reliable electricity for all. Dharnai shows what real development -- development that doesn't cost the Earth -- looks like. It is this kind of sustainable development that Greenpeace India stands for. And it shows the absurdity of recent suggestions that Greenpeace in India is acting against India's national interest.Ironically, Greenpeace India's work to bring energy to Dharnai has been rewarded with brickbats rather than bouquets by India's recently elected government. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has suspended Greenpeace India's ability to receive foreign donations and has also frozen the organization's domestic accounts.Even as my Indian colleagues prepare to answer the MHA's allegations, in court if necessary, the Indian government's actions beg the question -- how does delivering electricity to a village that had none, or advocating for clean air, safe food, protecting forests and legally sanctioned rights equate to undermining economic interests?But the story of Dharnai goes well beyond India. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide live without electricity. For them, the Dharnai solar-powered micro-grid could be a game-changer, a model for bringing clean, reliable energy to all.Communities without electricity, and their governments, can make a leap forward by setting up their own renewable-power systems. They can avoid the pollution from coal-burning power plants and build a clean-energy system that local communities own and control.If all of us put our efforts into achieving a renewably powered world, we can conquer climate change and vastly improve the livelihoods of people in even the poorest regions. That is the message of Earth Day in 2015.

On Monday, Stack published a blog post on Pacific Whale Foundation's website, detailing their discovery.\"A humpback whale penis can be up to 10 feet long and is normally concealed inside the animal’s genital slit,\" Stack wrote. \"Seeing the penis extrude from this slit is a rare sight, which is why we were so astonished and pleased about the footage.\"The penis extrusion documented by Stephanie Stack and Jens Currie.Although Stack and Currie aren't the first to film a whale swimming with his penis out, Stack said the opportunity \"doesn't happen very often.\"It is expensive and extremely difficult to document whales' sexual behavior. Researchers have not yet filmed whales having sex or giving birth so footage of the competition pod was monumental for the foundation's researchers, Stack said.\"We were really excited when we [saw the penis] after the fact,\" she told HuffPost. \"We aren't specifically studying sexual behavior [so this discovery] was just sort of a happy mistake.\"Stack said she thinks the whale was actually directing its sexual act toward another male, though she can't confirm that yet. If the recipient of the humpback's attention was a male, \"it [wouldn't] necessarily be reproductive behavior,\" she explained. \"It might be some form of aggression, or maybe the whale was excited due to the competition that was going on.\"The whale as it approaches another whale with its penis extruded. Stack thinks the whale was approaching another male whale.Stack is now in a year-long process of writing a scientific journal article that will explain the footage and what it might reveal about humpback whales' reproduction behaviors."}, {"title": "Regret to Inform You: Coal Blasting Rages On", "text": "Judy Kellen, neighbor of Peabody's Rocky Branch Mine from Students Against Peabody on Vimeo.The Washington University Students Against Peabody Energy ruined my Earth Day. They sent me footage of a recent fact-finding trip to Saline County, Illinois, where some of my family members, friends and farmers are being blasted by nearby Peabody Energy strip-mining operations.Regret to inform you: Coal blasting rages on in southern Illinois, along with cancer-linked mountaintop removal operations in central Appalachia, and mining across the West.Let's get the narrative right: Coal is not dying, it's declining and shifting, and though mountaintop removal is on the ropes, the knockout still awaits federal action. US coal mining production in 2015 is still set for 926 million tons, down from 996 millions tons, and estimated to rebound to 941 millions tons in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Thanks to the Appalachian decline, the Illinois Basin mined 104.9 million tons in 2014, up 4.6%.Whether it's 996, 941 or 926 million tons of coal, that's still a lot of unprotected coal mine blasting now linked to cancer, and higher rates of birth defects and disease.While I love to write about clean energy solutions, Appalachian transition and coalfield regeneration, and the inspiring regenerative city movement, to ignore the deadly impacts of mountaintop removal and coal mining is a betrayal to the residents living on the front lines of coal mining mayhem today.Thankfully, impacted residents and groups continue the fight, despite the odds: Over 80,000 people have recently signed CREDO's petition for a moratorium on cancer-linked mountaintop removal mining through the Appalachian Community Health Emergency Act.Does a moratorium sound impossible? In Wales last week, the Assembly Members voted 30-0 after an informative debate to place a moratorium on open cast (strip) mining, similar to the ACHE Act, to study the impact of mining on residents.It would be great to see such leadership in the US Congress, and among health and environmental groups based on Capitol Hill.Earth Day has come and gone, but not the struggle to end mountaintop removal, which was launched in the same year: In 1970, an arsenal of explosives and draglines breached the ramparts of Bullpush Mountain in the Cannelton area of West Virginia, and blasted the first mountaintop removal mining operation.Despite years of litigation, protests, education campaigns, public hearings and regulatory promises, the cancer-linked strip mine operations continue today in central Appalachia as the flip side of Earth Day's promise of restorative justice.To celebrate Earth Day and not acknowledge the devastation of mountaintop removal, which provides only a small percentage of our national coal production, is to betray the origins of Earth Day itself.Few people may recall that one of inspirations of Earth Day emerged out of earlier Human Ecology Symposiums organized by public health professor Morton Hilbert, to address the impact of our footprint on the land and its inhabitants.Our nation's collective inaction over the fallout from strip mining and mountaintop removal does not simply mock the goals of Earth Day co-founder and former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, for \"an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for all other human being and all living creatures.\"The federal sanctioning of such deadly mountaintop removal operations obliterates the very essence of Earth Day's purpose--and makes us all complicit to a crime against our earth and its Appalachian residents, as well as those dealing with strip mining in southern Illinois and the West.So, let's be honest: The day after Earth Day is just another day of strip mine blasting in America--until we decide to take a stand like Wales, CREDO and the Washington University students, and end it."}, {"title": "13-Year-Old's Death Is Latest Tragedy For Island Surrounded By Shark-Infested Waters", "text": "On the morning of April 12, before 13-year-old Elio Canestri was killed by a shark while surfing at a beach in his native Reunion Island, he left a note for his mother.\"Don't worry,\" the young surfing champion wrote, according to NBC News. \"I'm going surfing. If there's no security, I won't surf.\"Canestri was referring to shark \"spotters,\" or officials who are tasked with monitoring sharks from the shore while others are out in the water.The teen and his friends were reportedly surfing in an unmonitored area, where surfing was restricted, during the fatal attack.Canestri's death was the 16th in a series of shark attacks -- seven of which were fatal -- that have plagued the French island since 2011.\"Another shark attack in Reunion island this morning,\" professional surfer and Reunion Island native Jeremy Flores wrote on his Instagram after Canestri's death. \"Words can't describe how sad and angry I am.\"Attacking The Shark ProblemOfficials are debating how to handle Reunion Island's persistent shark problem. According to surf news website The Inertia, some island locals believe that the spike in shark attacks are related to a marine reserve created around the island. The reserve protects 80 percent of the island's coral reefs and limits the amount of fishing that can take place.Shark advocate and professional diver Frédéric Buyle -- who was hired by the government to dive and investigate around the island -- told GQ magazine that the waters around the island are ideal habitats for bull sharks because of the beaches that front streams and the nearby St. Gilles harbor, which is ripe with pollution and fish carcasses.\"Sharks like bull sharks have a territory and they cruise and patrol it all day long,\" Buyle told Vice in a 2013 interview about Reunion's spike in attacks. \"Shore and coastal waters are part of their territory, so there's nothing strange in the fact that they're seen in very shallow waters.\"Don't Go In The WaterIn 2013, the local government tried to ban surfing and swimming, restricting any ocean activities to a shallow lagoon and a small number of specific areas monitored by lifeguards. But the rule has proved difficult to enforce.The ban has been extended to February 2016 while the island's Shark Risk Reduction Program experiments with potential solutions, including underwater cameras that live stream videos of conditions, protective nets and drum lines -- floating barrels attached to lines and baited hooks meant to capture large sharks.Despite the ban, authorities have sanctioned official training sessions for the island's elite surfers, wherein divers with spear guns protect the surfers in the event of an attack.But the threat of sharks is still so severe on Reunion Island that many locals have stopped going into the water altogether, and the island's best up-and-coming surfers are being sent away to train. The Agence France-Presse reported that the number of licensed surfers in Reunion Island fell from 1,600 in 2011 to 400 today, and there is only one surf school left on the island, compared to the 14 that were once open.The rise in shark attacks is doing more than keeping people out of the water -- it's hurting the island's economy, too. Reunion, an idyllic island just off the eastern coast of Madagascar, relies heavily on tourism and traveling surfers. According to Surfer Magazine, there is usually a 60 percent tourist cancellation rate after a shark attack occurs on the island.The Controversial CullDesperate for solutions, officials have tried a shark cull of 90 bull sharks and tiger sharks, which has been very controversial. During the cull, local authorities grant authorized fishermen the permission to catch and kill the sharks until their limit is reached.The shark culls have created a division between surfers who want to protect their lineups and environmentalists who believe that killing sharks is inhumane and ineffective.Members of the French Surfing Federation have urged local authorities to resume the shark cull, according to the Agence France-Presse, citing that tiger sharks and bull sharks -- the species connected to the attacks -- are not threatened or protected.Many others believe culling is not the answer and are exploring other ways of protecting humans against sharks.\"As long as these devices are not fatal for sharks, we have no problem with that,\" Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, told Néoplanète Magazine in February. \"[Sharks are] predators whose role as cleaners and managers of marine wildlife is crucial for biodiversity ... If we kill them, we really are killing our oceans, and we can not live without the ocean.\"On April 20, Imaz Press reported that local fishermen culled a young bull shark and a 400-pound tiger shark in response to Canestri's death."}, {"title": "This Creepy Video Of An Octopus Chasing A Crab Will Chill Your Soul", "text": "It's horrifying. It's fascinating. We can't look away.YouTube user Bettina Turnbull uploaded this video on April 10 of an octopus hotly pursuing a crab. According to the description, she filmed it at Rose Bay Wharf in Sydney, Australia.The crab puts up a good fight, zigging and zagging across the surface of the water. But the octopus eerily shape-shifts after its prey. As an Imgur user put it, \"resistance is futile.\"There's something deeply alien about octopuses. To creep you out even more, they're highly intelligent with their own distinct personalities. They can open childproof medicine bottles, play with toys and recognize different humans.  A  New Zealand octopus is smart enough to take pictures of aquarium visitors. And they have a well-documented taste for crabs."}, {"title": "Earth Day and Environmental Values Aren't Justification for Ignoring Evidence", "text": "The voters of Concord Massachusetts decided a few years ago to ban the sale of single serving plastic water bottles. This was the result of a couple things; the strong environmental passions in the community, and the fact that Concord has an open town meeting form of government. Issues big and small are put before the public, and any local citizen who comes to the meeting gets to vote. It's about the purest form of democracy you can imagine. Which makes it, as Winston Churchill said, the worst form of government ever, except for all the others.Town meeting is dangerously susceptible to decision making based more on values and emotions than evidence, a worrisome vulnerability in these days of increasing science denialism. Democratic, yes. Evidence-based intelligent decision making? Well, no.But there can still be wisdom in the crowd, objective consideration of the scientific evidence about what would do the most good. The other night, Concord town meeting voters overwhelmingly defeated a call to stop fluoridating public drinking water, rejecting the proposal of a few who denied massive scientific evidence about the net benefits of fluoride and instead promoted excessive and largely unsubstantiated fears. And in another vote even more heartening for decision making based on the evidence rather than emotions, the town also rejected a move to block the use of artificial turf on playing fields.The line of speakers in favor of that idea was long, their environmental passions fierce. Standard alarmist tropes like \"toxic chemicals\" (followed by a long list of scary polysyllabic examples) and \"we're using our children as guinea pigs\" were invoked. Simplistic faith in anything natural and demonization of anything artificial could be heard in pleas to \"protect our natural environment\", \"grass is organic, plastic is not\", and even \"What would Thoreau do?\" (It is not blasphemous to say that to some in Concord, Henry David has near Jesus-like status.)Opponents of artificial turf brushed aside multiple thorough risk assessments that have found that these fields are not a health risk, using standard science denial language like \"there is no proof these fields are safe\" and \"the research hasn't been done\" and \"if they contain toxic chemicals, it just stands to reason that the fields are toxic.\"Several argued against artificial turf on grounds of environmental sustainability. A leader of the local environmental group charged that \"a 2-acre artificial turf field generates 55.6 tons of carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, pollutants and chemicals.\" This last claim ignored a preliminary life cycle analysis (Environmental and Health Impacts of Artificial Turf, A Review) that found that artificial turf fields are more environmentally favorable than grass fields, which also have environmental costs.It was a stunning display of environmental values denying science evidence, from an intelligent group of passionate people who were pretty clearly looking at things through their environmental beliefs and ignoring or denying hard facts that didn't fit with their values. It was similar to the way ideology clouds the objectivity of those who deny the evidence on climate change.A number of speakers challenged the move to block artificial turf. Many cited the robust evidence that such surfaces pose no health risk. Some introduced themselves as professionals or academics in environmental health sciences, and tried to address generic environmental chemophobia by explaining toxicology and risk assessment and even the basics of chemistry. One speaker even tried to dispel fears of \"that chemical smell\" from artificial turf. Apparently it's some form of sulfur.But these speakers weren't really defending plastic grass. They were defending evidence-based reason. Most of them were clearly frustrated by the emotionalism of the other side. In the end this wasn't an argument about what kind of surface to put on playing fields. This was a deeper conflict between values and reason, about whether we should base our decisions on what our gut says or on what the facts say.And encouragingly, reason won. 302 people voted to for the proposal to block artificial turf. But 454 rejected that proposal, because it seemed to be based more on emotion and less on an objective consideration of the evidence.Many Concordians are proud that our town has become a national model with our ban on single serving plastic water bottles, a ban that got worldwide attention. But I suggest we should be even prouder of the vote we took the other night, a vote that demonstrates that open democracy can give fair voice to passionate values and still choose to rely on a thoughtful objective analysis of the evidence as people try to figure out what will do them and their communities the most good."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - April 23, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: After years of denial, Oklahoma finally admits fracking causes earthquakes; Fines and accountability for oil spills, coal waste spills, and deadly natural gas explosions; PLUS: Environmentalists push back at new Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal...

But the good news is that anyone can learn how to compost at home, regardless of your living situation. In a few cities, such as San Francisco and Seattle, you may already be required to separate your yard waste as part of the city waste program; composting this waste yourself is a natural next step!Why Compost? According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, food scraps and yard waste make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. Composting these materials can keep them out of the landfills, which helps reduce your carbon footprint. Composting will also supply you with natural fertilizer that will enrich your garden's soil, and reduce your need to buy chemical fertilizers. You'll be surprised by how little you will need to throw out with your trash once you start the process (especially if you recycle, too!), since so much of that material can be diverted into the compost bin.Other Things to Note While Composting Outside Your compost is ready to use when the material is dark in color and feels crumbly. That could take anywhere from two months, if you are stirring it around and adding water frequently, to two years if you let this happen naturally. Make sure larger material is either chopped or shredded so it will break down faster. You don't want to add any dairy, meat or bones to the compost because these things can attract pests or animals. You will also want to moisten dry materials with some water as you add them to the pile. Try to maintain the 3:1 ratio of brown to green materials for the right balance of carbon to nitrogen.Indoor Composting You can reduce your carbon footprint by composting indoors even if you don't have a backyard! It's only a little bit different than the steps above. Get an indoor composting bin online or at a hardware or gardening supply store (or make your own DIY bin from a plastic container). Indoor compost bins are usually smaller in size to fit in a small space, such as under a sink or in a closet. The bin should also come with a lid and some holes for air circulation. There should be no odors if you're achieving the right mix of soil to food scraps to shredded newspaper along with mixing it in once a week. There are also indoor systems that use worms and microbes to speed the process.Keep an eye on the compost and dump the fertilizer on your houseplants or your patio garden plants every two weeks to maintain the bin. A well-maintained and secure compost bin should not attract insects or rodents. Be sure to add about a cup full of dirt and shredded newspaper to your indoor composting bin every two weeks as well, or your compost may emit unpleasant odors, which is certainly not something you want to have inside your home!About Julie Jacobson Julie Jacobson is a real estate agent for Redfin and a green home expert.

The release of bunker fuel into the sanctuary of English Bay, and its aftermath, have highlighted a reckless, heady and myopic approach to economic development characteristic of decision-makers with nothing to lose, for it is we who bear the risk. This writer does not suggest that it is wise or, indeed, possible to turn off the taps of oil that will be burgeoning through our waterways at increasing levels in years to come. We sit on the coronary artery supplying the beating heart of Canada's economy. But it is foolish to suggest we must do so without adequate protective measures. It is simply irresponsible governance.Our elected leaders are behaving like thieves in the night, terrified the bounty will be exhausted by the dawn, rather than statesmen executing sound economic and social policy. They take negligible protective measures when executing same policy and fail to explain why the two must be mutually exclusive. As Mr. Harper's Conservatives impose greater risks to our province without the corresponding protections necessary, it becomes clear that this issue is not merely about pipelines or tar sands or climate change or political economic ideology; this is about responsible governance. We depend upon our elected leaders to govern responsibly. We demand this.Responsible governance means consulting with communities on the ground and making key decisions in collaboration with stakeholders, not in spite of them. It means engaging all levels of government when making decisions that affect the people they represent. It is to engage evidence-based science in order to make sound policy decisions. It is to ensure that after a thoughtful and inclusive process, if necessary risks are to be undertaken, then corresponding protections must accompany those risks. It is to be certain of the plan of execution if catastrophe befalls us.The governance model of the Harper Conservatives, built upon the twin pillars of secrecy and fear, is to keep us in the dark about the very issues that matter most of all: our health, our families, our environment and our homes. The Conservatives' single-minded path to economic development means paving over the people of British Columbia rather than collaborating with them. At every step of the way, this government has sought to change facts on the ground rather than engage communities.We saw it when they hollowed out the environmental review process, extracting key stakeholders from the judicial process of the National Energy Board and relegating the Board to a symbolic role, while placing final decision-making power with the Harper cabinet. We saw it again this week when it took twelve hours for federal bodies to inform the City of Vancouver of what was happening in its own backyard.Good governance means embracing an environmental review process that includes the people and governments who are most affected by proposed projects, rather than one that robs stakeholders of their voices. It requires taking calculated risk. Assessing risk as if it were your backyard, your neighbours, your people who stand to pay the price. Refusing to gamble recklessly with the well-being of those who have placed their trust in you.It means understanding risk before undertaking it. Kinder Morgan's increase in tar sands tanker traffic through Burrard Inlet would add approximately 400 more tankers to the harbour annually, each carrying 600,000 barrels of tar sands oil, or three times as much as was spilled in the catastrophic Exxon Valdez spill. In spite of this, the Conservatives chose to close the Kitsilano Coast Guard Station  and the Vancouver Marine Communication Terminal in the Vancouver harbour, shifting the responsibility to stations in Richmond and on Vancouver Island. Indeed, it was a recreational boater who finally spotted the spilling fuel this past week in the waters of the busiest port in Canada.Although Mr. Harper continues to trumpet a \"world-class spill response system\", we have learned that it took six hours -- a response that by account of former commander of the closed station ought to have taken six minutes- for the Coast Guard to get booms in place to respond to this relatively minor spill of fuel- not oil- within sight of the city center. At the same time, Kinder Morgan has been permitted to keep their emergency response plan under a veil of secrecy, refusing the provincial government's demands for the details of that plan and denying BC citizens the right to assess the risk. These failings leave British Columbians feeling helpless and in the dark about the realities of the risks under their own roof.Vancouverites know the healing route along the winding seawall, ebbing and flowing into land and water as if to mirror the synching waves. We know the chilled breeze as we round the corner of \"palm tree rock\" and briefly slip away from the sun's beam. We know the glorious sight that overwhelms us as we round the next corner and enter the sun's grace again. We know the smiles and the ease with which we greet one another along this stretch of nature preserved and protected in our city. We know how our feet slip on the lichen-coated stones and how, when the tide is out, we can walk outwards on the rocks until nothing separates us from the expansive ocean. We are deeply and personally connected to this place that brings us so much joy and asks for nothing in return but mutual respect.Even at this early stage, it is clear from the Coast Guard's statements that we simply won't know how much fuel was released by the ship responsible for the recent spill, or how much may have sunk beyond the reach of clean-up crews. More than 4,000 people have volunteered to help with the clean-up efforts. Such acts of engagement and personal responsibility make me incredibly proud to be a member of this community. But it is not right to depend on members of our community to clean up the federal government's mess. As we round the corner of this clean-up, it's time to clean up the mess in Ottawa so that we can protect the people of British Columbia from an environmental and economic catastrophe."}, {"title": "Some Backing Climate Change are Still in Denial", "text": "On Earth Day, as every day, there are those who get into celebrating the planet and trying to tweak our lifestyle for the common good, and there are those who don't.Those who don't sometimes make good points about home recycling bins as mere spit in the ocean of vast industrial pollution, and other times indulge in stubborn ear-plugging accompanied by magical and/or wishful thinking.To all of us who recognize a scientifically credible threat, the head-in-sand position can be frustrating and we might roll our eyes at its ridiculousness. Yet even among the environmentally serious, there's a split between those who acknowledge scientific, quantifiable facts and those who go for, well, ear-plugging accompanied by magical and/or wishful thinking.Let's talk about almonds! That's the consensus, after all, on California's epic drought and the measures recommended to combat it: Taking shorter showers pales in comparison to the almond industry's massive water use, consuming a full 10 percent of the state's water. So almonds are what we should really be talking about, right?Well, they're a thirsty crop, but nothing like meat and dairy, which consumes a full 47 percent of the state's water, according to a Pacific Institute report on California's \"Water Footprint.\" Put another way, per calorie, beef uses over twice as much water as almonds. No matter how you slice it, meat is by far the bigger water-waster. How prominently have you seen this mentioned in California drought coverage?It's not just almonds and water -- the same skewed focus holds in many sectors. Quinoa production's good news/bad news for local economies made headlines, but not the analogous effect of animal agribusiness -- most starving children, after all, live in countries whose crops go to feed animals eaten by westerners. And we hear a lot about palm oil production resulting in the loss of rainforest, while five times as much rainforest is lost to animal agriculture.Fracking is an eco-problem because it produces methane -- almost exactly the same amount nationally as does animal agriculture -- while both consuming and polluting water, as does livestock production, only more so. \"Climate-change\" discussions center on fossil fuel alternatives -- while animal agriculture is, at the least, a larger factor than all human transportation, and by some credible estimates is larger than all other factors combined.In view of public health concerns, parents refusing vaccines for their children are vilified by parents stuffing their children and themselves with meat and dairy. Yet in addition to meat's proven individual health risks, factory farms' casual daily use of antibiotics is driving us toward a future where antibiotics will be useless -- all as 23,000 people annually are dying from new \"superbugs.\"In almost any comparison of plant foods to animal foods, the latter are both more resource-heavy on the uptake and more earth-unfriendly on the outflow. The only case-by-case question is whether they're just somewhat worse (as is, say, cow's milk is vs. almond milk) or, more often, worse by orders of magnitude. A notorious debate centers on whether beef, as compared to wheat, requires a mere 15 times as much water, or 300 times as much. (Most mainstream scientific estimates settle in at around 100x.)The list of ways this one factor threatens our planet's ecosystems is too long to go into here -- nitrous oxide, methane, ocean dead zones, air pollution, topsoil erosion, species extinction, even violent crime -- all are documented to correlate solidly with animal agribusiness. So why isn't that the first topic out of the gate in mainstream discussions of eco-conservation?The thing is, most of us don't like looking at or talking about meat and dairy's origins, and opt for, well, ear-plugging accompanied by magical and/or wishful thinking (\"humane slaughter,\" anyone?) rather than tackling some of the most germane problems.It's true that earth-friendly lifestyle changes are a challenge. As mentioned, individual actions can seem insignificant compared to the big picture. But eating vegan is one change that trades the least pain (read: inconvenience) for the most gain. And it's a change that can be implemented society-wide cheaply and relatively quickly as compared to the schedule for altering our technological infrastructure.Any of us who claim to take science seriously, whether or not we're ready to drop animal foods right now, should be candidly evaluating and discussing this global polluter and leading climate-change factor. One thing all of us can do right now is to educate ourselves about the scope of this problem. A great one-stop shop is the film Cowspiracy, which is available online at cowspiracy.com, and can be seen for $1 on Earth Day.This movie looks at the apparent blind spot of most major environmental organizations in the U.S. as to what is, numerically and scientifically speaking, the main enemy of the environment. The web site also has a good roundup of the facts presented, with scientific sources, at coswpiracy.com/facts.So maybe we should cut the climate change deniers a little slack. There is, at least, a certain internal logic to pretending \"global warming\" is a vast conspiracy and we should keep everything as is. But acknowledging the urgency of the threat and then failing to take a clear look at the most efficient, cost-effective alternatives? That's just nuts."}, {"title": "'Globalization and Its Discontents'", "text": "Part of the genius behind the Goldman Environmental Prize is that it not only rewards inspiring individuals but spotlights communities and struggles that would otherwise remain off the global community's radar screen. The prize recipients this year -- the 25th -- were no exception. Few in the audience -- or those exposed to the media coverage of this year's winners -- had ever heard of Myanmar's proposed Myitsone Dam on the Irawaddy River, blocked by the efforts of Myint Zaw. Even living next door to Canada, I was utterly unaware of the successful struggle by Marilyn Baptiste's Xeni Gwet'in First Nation of British Columbia to stop an enormous gold and copper mine that would have destroyed Fish Lake, the anchor of their spiritual identify. Nor had I any knowledge of the proposed Agua Zarca Dam in Honduras, a joint project of Honduran company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (DESA) and Chinese state-owned Sinohydro, the world's largest dam developer. The indigenous Lenca people who would be displaced by the dam had no voice in the decision to construct it until Berta Cacera, this year's winner from South America, organized her people to force Sinohydro to pull out.Supporting heroes like these in struggles that had previously gone unrecognized also highlights the underlying -- and often vicious -- architecture of today's global economy. None of these three projects was driven by local needs or designed for local benefit. All represented efforts by remote elites to poach yet-unindustrialized natural commons -- as if British Columbia, Honduras and Myanmar were somehow Robinson Crusoe's desert island, waiting to be appropriated by the first comer under \"finders, keepers\" doctrines. The Myitsone Dam would have generated electricity to be shipped to remote China. The copper and gold from the Prosperity mine were for the benefit not of the Xeni Gwet'in but of global mining behemoth TML. The electricity from the Aqua Zarca dam was intended for local use -- but not by local communities. Since a 2009 coup, the new Honduran government has awarded a full 30 percent of the nation's land as mining concessions to global mining interests; the Aqua Zarca dam was going to provide power for these mines. (Just to get a sense of what those mining concessions mean, imagine that foreign mining companies had been given an essentially unfettered right to strip mine all of Texas, California, Colorado, New Jersey, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Michigan, Wyoming, Kentucky Tennessee, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Maryland -- and that dams like the Grand Coulee were being redirected to serving these foreign companies.)So in addition to its recognition of and support for these front-line defenders of their communities, there's a vital educational outcome to the Goldman Prize. But front-line narratives -- in isolation -- have a weakness. They generate empathy but not community. The audience at the Goldman ceremony, or those who read the stories or watch the videos, are encountering someone else's struggle -- a weaker motivator for action than learning about their own struggles. This is intensified when our consumption is, indirectly, driving the exploitation, but at the same time most of us feel powerless to make choices that change that. After all, we don't have a clue where the iron ore in our stainless-steel water flask came from. Honduras?So I want to bookend this year's Goldman Prize with two additional data points. The first is a stunning statistic. A large share of the world's manufacturing capacity has shifted over the past decade from Europe and North America to China. This has powered enormous economic growth, but it has also generated enormous volumes of climate and health pollution. Thirty-six percent of the sulfur dioxide, 27 percent of the nitrogen oxides and 17 percent of the black carbon that contribute to China's infamous air-pollution problem are emitted in the production of goods for export -- about a fifth of this in exports to the U.S.Manufacturing goods in China for export to the U.S. not only shifts pollution from the U.S. to China but dramatically increases total global pollution; Chinese manufacturing has emission rates ranging from six to 17 time those in the U.S. and the EU.So American outsourcing of manufacturing to China has had a major negative impact on the health of the Chinese population. But it turns out that China is not like Las Vegas, in that what goes on in China doesn't stay in China. Chinese air pollutants are transported by upper atmospheric winds across the Pacific -- and while their concentrations are diluted on this journey, they are not, it turns out, rendered harmless. A new study shows that even in 2007, when the volumes of Chinese pollution were much lower than they are today, air pollution emitted in China while producing goods for export was responsible for up to 24 percent of total sulfate pollution over the Western United States, as shown in the chart below:So the current trade regime between China and the U.S. is not just a matter of the U.S. exporting manufacturing jobs to China and importing cheaper consumer goods. We are also dramatically increasing the volume of pollution associated with our consumption, so much that while the worst health impacts are in China, a significant part of U.S. pollution is now generated in China in the production of goods for U.S. consumers. We import pollution as well as goods -- which brings me to another big piece of news this week: the agreement between congressional Republican leaders and some Senate Democrats (but not Minority Leader Harry Reid) to grant President Obama \"fast-track\" authority for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. While the White House maintains that the TPP will be a new kind of trade deal, one that will protect the environment, that simply isn't true. Like the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), the TPP will take the view that countries cannot set pollution standards for the way in which goods they import are produced. Indeed, while it will prevent the U.S. from setting pollution standards for factories exporting to our consumers, it will also permit corporations to sue to lower pollution standards that already exist here.This doctrine was based on the notion that Americans are not affected by pollution control standards in China and therefore ought not to interfere. This is clearly not the case for climate pollution, as CO emitted anywhere has the same impact on the California drought. But it is also clearly not clear for conventional health pollution -- even for countries separated by the Pacific Ocean, much less for close neighbors like those in Central America or Europe.So we need to recognize that the front-line communities in British Columbia, Myanmar or Honduras are not just protecting their health and ecosystems; they are defending ours. What puts them most at risk, however, is our willingness to tolerate a global economic system in which multinational producers are permitted to bribe and bully weak governments into giving them the right to exploit local resources for distant shareholder profits. Passing fast-track authority will make us even more complicit in the destruction of lives and communities that is produced by our current economic system, with its emphasis on industrial exploitation at any cost and without any local accountability."}, {"title": "Top Environmental Agencies Release Diversity Data", "text": "On April 22, 2015, which marked the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, Green 2.0, an initiative dedicated to increasing racial diversity across mainstream environmental agencies, released the names of over 25 of America's leading environmental advocacy organizations that voluntarily submitted their diversity data to GuideStar.Among the organizations that had shared their employee and board diversity information are Environmental Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society and the Conservation Fund.Other groups, such as the Pew Charitable Fund, Resources Legacy Fund and Conservation International, have not done so. In fact, 18 of the nation's largest mainstream environmental advocacy organizations have so far declined to disclose their diversity numbers to GuideStar, a site that aims to bring more transparency by providing data on thousands of nonprofits.\"I commend the organizations and foundations that have committed to openness and transparency on diversity and submitted their diversity data,\" U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Arizona) told reporters on a press call Wednesday. \"However, it is troubling that some green organizations and the foundations that support them have not taken this initial step towards a more diverse sector.\"Grijalva stressed that diversifying green organizations and foundations would make them \"more effective in addressing current and future environmental challenges.\"While many acknowledged the lack of diversity, few have expressed any urgency to address it, according to a study commissioned by Green 2.0. Nor did anyone seem to have a game plan. \"Although people of color are now almost 40 percent of the U.S. population, they have not broken the 16-percent 'green ceiling' in mainstream environmental organizations and foundations,\" noted Robert Raben, the founder and president of The Raben Group and Green 2.0.The report found that, on average, minorities make up less than 5 percent of \"mainstream\" environmental organizations' boards, despite the fact that people of color support environmental protection at a higher rate than whites, according to Raben. However, these organizations \"are not adequately reaching out to organizations representing people of color communities,\" he said.The diversity data collected on GuideStar will be held up like a mirror to various organizations, said Jacob Harold, the president and CEO of Guidestar.Denis Hayes, who was national organizer of the first Earth Day and is now the president of the Bullitt Foundation, encouraged other organizations to participate in this effort. \"We are all most likely to improve the things that we measure,\" he said.\"At its birth, the environmental movement was a big tent, welcoming to all who shared its basic commitment to a healthy, resilient, equitable, peaceful future,\" he added. \"We need to return to those roots.\"Hayes is among the few philanthropy leaders who have already made their information available on their GuideStar profile. People of color represent 50 percent of the staff of the Bullitt Foundation, and 27 percent of its board.EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and philanthropist advocate Tom Steyer are among those who are calling for other environmental organizations to submit their diversity information.Kris Sarri, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Department of the Interior, said the nation will need to draw on talents of the next generation to deal with pressing environmental challenges. \"Diversity is critical,\" she noted. The millennial generation \"is the most diverse population in our history,\" but they also are \"the most disconnected from natural world,\" she said.Green 2.0 is calling on other large foundations and organizations to step up and submit their own data. \"We urge the organizations and foundations who have not submitted data to submit in the next two months,\" Raben said. \"Tracking data is a basic first step, whether you are trying to solve climate disruption or diversity.\"\"We celebrate today's progress, but we have work to do, and we haven't truly won until this movement is truly diverse and inclusive,\" he added.Green 2.0's partnership with GuideStar and D5, a coalition dedicated to expanding diversity in the philanthropic sphere, is a first-of-its-kind effort to collect diversity data from NGOs and foundations on a national scale.Andrew Lam is the author of Perfume Dreams: Reflections on the Vietnamese Diaspora, which won the 2006 PEN Open Book Award, and East Eats West: Writing in Two Hemispheres.

The report also incorporates the effects of human activity into earthquake hazard models used to assess risk for insurance and building regulation purposes.“These earthquakes are occurring at a higher rate than ever before and pose a much greater risk to people living nearby,\" Mark Petersen, chief of the USGS National Seismic Hazard Modeling Project, said in a news release.The report, which draws on the conclusions of a November 2014 workshop co-hosted by the USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey, only examined Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.Seventeen areas in eight states have seen more man-made earthquakes since 2009.The USGS said these frequent man-made earthquakes \"greatly\" increase the overall earthquake probability for Oklahoma and the other affected areas compared to the probability in the latest National Seismic Hazard Model, published in 2014. The national maps, which are updated every six years, detail the hazard levels for naturally caused earthquakes in the U.S.Man-made earthquakes were intentionally left out of last year's model because of how difficult they are to predict, the new report explained. Typical national models forecast earthquake likelihood over a 50-year period, but Thursday's report introduces models that offer only a one-year time period for assessing risk. These short-term models, which the agency hopes to finalize later this year, should be useful because of uncertainties surrounding the wastewater injection wells believed to cause man-made earthquakes.These injection wells, which number in the tens of thousands in some states, are frequently used to dispose of the chemical-laden saltwater produced during oil and natural gas extraction. The wastewater is injected thousands of feet underground to avoid contaminating freshwater sources. The fluid can then lubricate underground faults, lessening the friction between them and triggering an earthquake.With the boom of the U.S. oil and gas industry in the past decade, and the increased use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, techniques, has come a rise in the number of active injection wells. There has been evidence of these wells leaking, as well as inducing seismic activity.The USGS was clear that fracking itself is less commonly a cause of earthquakes than wastewater injection. \"USGS’s studies suggest that the actual hydraulic fracturing process is only occasionally the direct cause of felt earthquakes,\" the agency wrote. \"Most wastewater disposfal wells do not produce felt earthquakes,\" it added.The report relies on previous research into increased earthquakes, and accepts the conclusion that human activities like disposal wells do contribute to the greater number of quakes, but does not explore the exact causes of these quakes. Rather, the researchers \"try to find a way to quantify the associated hazard.\"The number of earthquakes with a magnitude of 3 or greater in the eastern and central U.S. have increased in the recent decades with a sharp uptick in the past few years.Oklahoma, the most seismically active of the lower 48 states last year, has also seen the greatest increase in earthquakes, with 585 earthquakes measuring magnitude 3 or higher in 2014. Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3 are usually the smallest that can be felt by people.“We think society can manage the hazard,” USGS geophysicist William Ellsworth told the Los Angeles Times. “We don’t have to stop production of oil and gas, but we think we can do so in a way that will minimize the earthquake hazard.”Earlier this week, the state of Oklahoma acknowledged injection wells' role in recent seismic activity, reversing years of skepticism. A new state-run website called \"Earthquakes in Oklahoma\" says it is \"very likely\" that the \"majority\" of recent earthquakes in parts of that state were \"triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.\"Oklahoma now sees two and a half earthquakes every day that are magnitude 3 or greater, according to a report from the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Before 2008, the state saw an average of only one and a half quakes per year above magnitude 3. The current average is now 600 times greater than it was before 2008.\"These rates and patterns of seismicity are very unlikely to represent a naturally occurring rate change and process,\" the OGS wrote in Tuesday's report. The agency acknowledged that the injection of leftover water from oil and gas operations is likely the primary cause of the increased earthquake activity, but said wastewater from fracking specifically \"represents a small percentage of the total volume\" of oil and gas wastewater in Oklahoma.“Oklahoma state agencies are already taking action to address this issue and protect homeowners,” Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) said in a press release this week, without elaborating."}, {"title": "A Call to Foundations to Step Up Giving, Act on Climate", "text": "It's time foundations stepped up their game when it comes to climate.That's the message from two foundations that have invested big in climate: Larry Kramer and Carol Larson of the Hewlett and Packard Foundations. They delivered their message in The Chronicle of Philanthropy (read the op-ed here) in what amounts to a philanthropic call to arms when it comes to fighting climate change. Put simply, their message is that the challenge we face is too great for philanthropy to be sitting on the sidelines.So what exactly is their point? Well, it's the fact that less than 2 percent of all philanthropic dollars are being spent in the fight against climate change. That's right, 2 percent. That's an appallingly low investment in the greatest battle of our time.Of course, how philanthropy spends its money matters too (as David Roberts explains so well here). It's not just about big checks; it's about small details. That's a big reason I'm bullish on the use of innovative tools like program-related investments to unlock clean-energy access markets for the poor in emerging economies. Because if we get the details right, if we ourselves become more innovative, we can use this increased investment to help accelerate a disruptive, distributed clean-energy future that can radically alter our present course.But the foundation community is simply not investing enough. Not even close. That's why Hewlett and Packard are stepping up and asking others to join them to stave off runaway climate change before it's too late.They made their call now because methane bombs are exploding in parts of Siberia known as \"the end of the world.\" Because California is in an epic drought that threatens the very foundation of our water supply. Because climate change refugees are no longer a theoretical future construct but real people looking for new homes, now. Because it's the right thing to do.Now, I'm about as cynical a climate advocate as there is. So I'm not a big fan of scare mongering, because I honestly just tune it out. But it's important to be grounded in reality, one in which we are playing chicken with a future laden with destruction, disease, and displacement. That's the freight train headed our way.But that need not be our future. The truth is that we have more than a fighting chance. In fact, I think the clean-energy revolution is inevitable. Nowhere will you find as resounding a case as BNEF founder Michael Liebreich's recent tour-de-force rundown of clean-energy trends. As his data-driven analysis clearly shows, we are now in a time of disruption, a time when dinosaurs will die, innovators will flourish and the only certainty is dramatic change -- a change that will not be linear, mind you.So for me it's not if but when. But there's the rub. We are in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter. We're still in the game, we're putting points on the board, we're coming back, but we don't have a lot of time. That's why we need to dramatically accelerate that transition. We simply can't wait for market trends alone to deliver us from our fate, let alone expect that.That's why we need bold visionaries willing to take this bull by the horns, people and institutions willing to invest in our future and fight the forces that seek to keep us mired in the past. We need those whose values are rooted in \"tolerance for risk, and a willingness to make big bets on problems worth solving,\" as Larry Kramer and Carol Larson so aptly put it. We need philanthropy to step up.If ever there were a problem worth solving, it's this one. If ever there were a time worth solving it, that time is now. The Hewlett and Packard Foundations are in. They're ready to act on climate.

Five of those dogs found homes in South Korea last month, but the remaining five could not be placed and were flown to adoptive families in the United States in April.The dogs, all male, have spent most of the last six years living inside cramped cages shown in the video. At the lab, they were known only by numbers, but have been given names by their new human families. According to the Beagle Freedom Project, the laboratory had planned to euthanize the dogs before rescue groups became involved and convinced them otherwise.The rescue organization did not release the name of the laboratory or details about the nature of the research that involved the dogs.Beagles specifically bred for lab use are frequently used forbiomedical research as well as in toxicity tests for pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals. The breed is commonly chosen not only because of the dog’s small size — which makes it easy to keep many of them in a tighter space — but also because of their gentle and docile nature.\"They will not bite a researcher when they’re being injected or having a tube being put down their throat,\" Shannon Keith, president of the Beagle Freedom Project, told The Huffington Post last year.According to USDA statistics, around 65,000 dogs were used in research facilities in the United States in 2012, though the statistics did not break down the dogs by breed.The new video comes shortly after lawmakers in Connecticut proposed a bill that would legally require testing facilities to offer cats and dogs to animal rescue groups, rather than euthanize them, after their time at the lab is over. Similar laws are are pending in New York, New Jersey, Nevada and California, and one is already in place in Minnesota, according to Fox Connecticut.H/T The DodoContact The Author"}, {"title": "Take Your Kids to Work... and Speak Up for Their Health", "text": "Thousands of parents across the U.S. today are taking part in the annual \"Take Your Child to Work Day.\" It's a great chance to show our sons and daughters just what we're up to every day while they're at school (or while they're home, if you work evenings), and maybe even to inspire them to start thinking about careers of their own.I normally work from a small office, so keeping my 4-year-old daughter Hazel with me all day as I work on my laptop might bore her to tears -- but she's come with me to other events many times in her short life. She's helped me testify at public hearings, stood with me at rallies, and even joined a conference or two.I do so much of my work with the Beyond Coal campaign for my daughter's future -- and for the future of all kids. I imagine that many of my colleagues who are parents feel the same. We work together to phase out coal plants so that families can enjoy cleaner air and water. We demand clean-energy investments to help fight climate change so that our kids and grandkids will have a safer, healthy planet when they grow up.Our kids deserve every opportunity for a safe and prosperous future. Keeping our children happy and healthy is the top concern for every parent, and for our communities as a whole.But when your kids have asthma, it becomes harder and harder to do just that. All your concerns are multiplied by the time, effort, and anxiety you face when trying to balance their care with the demands of making ends meet.  Take Your Child to Work Day shouldn't end in the emergency room. But for the parents of the 7 million American kids who suffer from asthma, sudden trips to the hospital are an all-too-common occurrence.One of the major triggers of asthma attacks is smog pollution -- the dirty air created after fossil fuel emissions mix with heat and sunlight. The doctors and scientists at the American Lung Association say young children breathing in smog pollution is like getting sunburn on their lungs. It wreaks havoc on their respiratory systems and can cause permanent lung damage and, in some cases, premature death.Children are at the greatest health risk from smog pollution because they are more likely to be active outdoors and their lungs are still developing. Asthma strikes nearly one out of every 10 schoolchildren in the United States and is the number-one health issue that causes kids to miss school. On \"bad-air days\" or \"air-alert days,\" particularly during the warmer months, kids with asthma are forced to stay indoors to avoid aggravating their condition.Smog pollution is even worse in communities of color, since African-American and Latino-American kids are more likely to live in counties with serious smog problems. In fact, African-American kids currently have nearly two times the rates of asthma as white children and are four times as likely to die from it.We can help change this reality for kids and parents by speaking up for stronger smog standards. Our voices are needed to counter the misinformation from big polluters who consistently choose their bottom lines over public health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is due to update our smog protections in October, and we need to push for a standard strong enough to protect the health of all children.This Take Your Child to Work Day, tell the EPA to side with working parents and their children, not polluters, by strengthening the smog pollution standard and giving us all a better quality of life.

Bloomberg reports that the difference in the emissions increase and the GDP increase -- 0.7 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively -- is considered a sign that emissions reductions efforts are not restraining economic expansion.\"The more we can grow our economy without increasing emissions by the same amount of that economic growth, it means that other factors such as energy intensity and the amount of carbon dioxide released in the production of that energy are offsetting the economic growth,\" said EIA report author Perry Lindstrom in an email to Reuters.Confirmation of the second consecutive annual increase in U.S. carbon emissions comes on the heels of commitments by the United States to a 26- to 28-percent cut in those emissions from 2005 levels by 2025.A recently released short-term forecast for U.S. power by Bloomberg New Energy Finance says that U.S. emissions-cutting efforts are about to get a huge boost. It projects that this year carbon pollution from the U.S. power sector will fall to its lowest level since 1994 as coal plants go offline and renewables come online. Meanwhile, a Duke University-led study based on 1,000 years of temperature records suggests that global warming is not progressing as fast as it would under the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Anti-Gas-Flaring Initiative Aims to Capture Easy Emissions ReductionsThe World Bank announced first-ever commitments by nine countries, 10 oil companies, and all six global development institutions to end the practice of routine gas flaring at oil production sites by 2030. The \"Zero Routine Flaring by 2030\" initiative was launched by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, who said the voluntary agreement will cut 40 percent of the global gas flaring that each year results in 300 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions -- equivalent to emissions from approximately 77 million cars.No U.S.-based companies have signed on to the initiative, which the World Bank and UN are using to build support for the UN-hosted climate conference aimed at forging a global climate agreement in Paris later this year.\"We think that to eliminate routine gas flaring is the low-hanging fruit on the climate agenda,\" said Bjorn Hamso, the World Bank's program manager for the Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership. \"Oil-producing countries who decide to join us in this effort, they can make that CO reduction part of their contribution to the negotiations in Paris.\"Signatories to the initiative will publicly report their flaring and progress toward the target on an annual basis and will prohibit routine flaring in new oil fields developments.U.S. Energy Infrastructure Requires 'Significant Change'To deal with the challenges of climate change, new technology, a changing energy supply and national security in the coming years, the U.S. electricity sector will require major modifications, according to a new report by the Obama administration.\"The United States' energy system is going through dramatic changes,\" said U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. \"This places a high premium on investing wisely in the energy infrastructure we need to move energy supplies to energy consumers.\"The report notes that the U.S. energy infrastructure -- 2.6 million miles of interstate and intrastate pipelines, about 640,000 miles of transmission lines, 414 natural gas storage facilities, 330 ports handling crude and petroleum and refined petroleum products and more than 140,000 miles of railways that handle crude petroleum -- is outdated.

For starters, April is when we celebrate both Earth Day and Arbor Day. As organizations that empower individuals to actively participate in improving the environment and their communities, Corps appreciate the attention these holidays bring to the ways we can each play a role in protecting our planet. Many Corps use Earth Day as an opportunity to engage their communities in conservation-focused volunteer projects. This year is no exception; we look forward to seeing all the great photos of Corps leading their friends, neighbors and local schools in planting trees, cleaning up parks and beaches, and pulling invasive plants. You can follow Earth Day-related Corps activities too by following the hashtags #corpsearthday and #servetheearth on social media.Though \"every day is Earth Day\" for Conservation Corps, we understand all too well how difficult it can be for many people to find time to enjoy the outdoors, let alone feel like they can contribute to protecting our environment in a meaningful way. However, the message of Earth Day is that we can (and should) all be environmentally conscious, even if it's just by recycling, being mindful of our water use, and turning off the lights when we leave a room. We applaud Corps for spreading this important environmental education on Earth Day and throughout the year, and for engaging people who might not traditionally be involved in the environmental conservation movement. As anyone who has participated in a Corps can tell you, service to one's community and the environment can be a profoundly empowering experience. Corps teach us that everyone -- young people and the traditionally disenfranchised in particular -- have the power and the right to make a positive impact on their environment.In addition to annual holidays, this April is important because it marks the official launch of Find Your Park, an initiative of the National Park Service and National Park Foundation to connect the next generation to America's parks. As studies show, today's children spend significantly less time outdoors than their parents or grandparents. They are more connected to screens than they are to nature. With its centennial coming up in 2016, the National Park Service is focused on making sure its next 100 years are even stronger than the first 100. To do this, they need to ensure that generations to come have an interest in not only visiting parks but becoming public land and water managers. Corps are united with the Park Service in the goal of getting more young people outdoors and interested in conservation. For years, Corps have completed vitally important maintenance and improvement projects in national parks across the country, ranging from Shenandoah in Virginia to the Grand Canyon in Arizona to Olympic National Park in Washington. The Corps Network was proud to participate in a Find Your Park launch event last week at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.Another reason that this April in particular is important is that it marks the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest spill in America's history. You may have seen news stories in the past few days about how the recovery process in the Gulf has been slow and there is still a great deal of restoration work to be done. Fortunately, not all of the news out of the Gulf this month is bad news; the second phase of The Corps Network's Gulf Coast Restoration Initiative (GCRI) pilot project got underway last week in Mississippi. Corpsmembers will spend the next seven weeks restoring coastal habitats in Mississippi's Hancock, Harrison and Jackson Counties. The goal of the GCRI is to build the capacity of Corps throughout the Gulf, giving young people in coastal communities the opportunity to be trained for careers in the increasingly important fields of wetland and riparian habitat restoration. The Corpsmembers who participate in the current GCRI pilot project could one day be the conservation experts who help prevent future man-made disasters in the Gulf and make sure all natural disasters are responded to in a timely fashion.One last reason that April is an important month for the Corps world is that spring means the start of the field season. With warmer weather and the end of the school year in sight, Corps are busy starting projects or finishing their final preparations to welcome Corpsmembers for spring and summer crews. This is a time when some Corps host orientations for recently recruited Corpsmembers, exposing them to environmental stewardship and the growing diversity of \"green careers\" available.April makes us think of things turning green, of new life and growth. It's a time when we think about our impact on the environment and what we can do to ensure that we make a positive impact. This April I hope you consider getting outdoors to find your park, join a volunteer project, or enjoy the beauty of the natural world just outside your front door.

Many have hailed this agreement as a first step toward more widespread commercial adoption of solar power. After all, how can any company go wrong traveling in the footsteps of Apple? Energy that is less expensive, clean, water-efficient. A feel-good moment!First Solar and Apple still have yet to answer a very important question, however. What will happen to the electronic waste?What waste, ye say? Well, let me tell ye about the waste.The California Flats Project, while only about the half the size of First Solar's Topaz Farm (the world's largest), will occupy nearly 3,000 acres of land (about 4.6 square miles) in the southeast corner of Monterey County, sufficient to generate solar power for the equivalent of 100,000 homes each year.Solar is very surface-intensive. One interesting estimate calculates the surface area required to power the planet's electricity needs in 2030 would blanket the entirety of Spain (lower estimates exist for global electricity demand as of 2010). You would need three hours to walk the circumference of the California Flats project site. Assuming comparable density, we would need 30,000 such solar farms to power the planet, and it would take you 40 years (based on a 40-hour week) to walk the circumference of all 30,000 sites.Hang on to that 30,000 figure. We'll return to it shortly.To power this equivalent of 100,000 homes on its California Flats project site, on behalf of the electricity needs of Apple and PG&E, First Solar will need to install about 5 million PV modules, each about the size and weight of a 48-inch flat panel television. So a stack-equivalent of 5 million televisions rising 1,000 miles into the sky. Weighing 150 million pounds, Which is one-third the total of all of the digital products Apple has recycled in its history.First Solar's thin-film modules are made using Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe). The CdTe technology offers the promise of more energy-efficient, more flexible solar cells. However, CdTe represents a synthesis of two extremely toxic chemicals. The purpose of this article is not make any claims about the public health risks posed by the CdTe in the First Solar PV modules (for this debate, see my article, \"First Solar's Inconvenient Truth\"). What I would like to point out, however, is that we are talking about 50 tons of CdTe spread evenly across 3,000 acres of land.What will happen to these modules at the end of the useful life of the California Flats project (estimated to be about 25-30 years)? This is an important question, because to avoid laying waste to the land, First Solar and Apple and PG&E will need to assume responsibility for what's called mitigation -- disassembling the solar farm, removing and recycling the 5 million PV modules, and restoring the land to some facsimile of its prior state.In 2008, First Solar company established a pre-funded recycling process that firmly established its leadership in the emerging conversation about appropriate producer responsibilities for solar energy's external costs. Between July 2008 and November 2009, the company's description of itself in press releases notably included this sentence: \"First Solar set the benchmark for environmentally responsible product life cycle management by introducing the industry's first pre-funded, comprehensive collection and recycling program for solar modules.\"In 2012, First Solar abandoned its commitment to pre-funded collection and recycling, shifting the burden of responsibility for managing the entire life-cycle of its solar farms largely to its clients. The company's 2014 10-K annual report disclosed, \"The percentage of modules sold that were subject to our solar module collection and recycling liability was 56 percent and 99 percent for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.\" First Solar denies the end of its pre-funding commitment represents a step back from its focus on environmental responsibility, but of course it does. Solar technology is a subset of the semiconductor and electronics industries, and because of the size and quantity of the surface area covered by its panels, is poised to create more electronic waste in the 21st century than any other technology sector.We've projected ultimate need for 30,000 solar farms equivalent to the California Flats project to meet global electricity demand by 2030. Using the California Flats installation as a benchmark, we can estimate that provisioning all 30,000 of these solar installations worldwide would require 150 billion modules, an unfathomably large quantity that, stacked, would weigh nearly 5 trillion pounds (2.5 billion tons) and stretch 30 million miles into space, or almost one-third of the way toward its power source, the sun. By comparison, total numbers of solar panels deployed globally to date probably don't exceed 2 billion.These projections are undoubtedly too high. Solar will not be the world's only power source in 2030. Solar cell efficiencies will undoubtedly improve significantly in the next 15 years. So let's (generously) reduce the 150 billion estimate by two-thirds, to 50 billion modules requiring fabrication, installation, management, and eventually decommissioning, collection, and recycling by 2060, less than 50 years from now. To put these numbers in perspective, the total weight of the solar PV modules for which we can reasonably expect deployment would exceed by a factor of 20 the 40 million tons of electronics waste generated globally in 2014 (most of which was not recycled). And these numbers only focus on PV installations through 2030.So clearly we need to be mindful of the electronic waste risks associated with solar power, and we need to fold this awareness into our assessment of any high-profile project that accues significant public relations and financial benefits to the companies involved. Apple and First Solar both stand to gain enormously from the California Flats project. But what's in the deal for the public if these companies do not assume, up front, the known costs of collecting and recycling the 5 million PV modules on the project site?The track record for power plant decommissioning and toxic waste disposal, in the United States and elsewhere, indicates we should place no confidence in the assurances, verbal or written, of the companies that initiate, finance, construct, and profit from these projects. In general, these companies receive most of the benefits, but are able to shift the costs, in the form of litigation and clean-up expenses, to the public. For these reasons, the European Union imposed mandatory producer recycling rules for solar modules in 2012 (one of the reasons First Solar pretty much exited the European market and abandoned its own prefunding commitments in 2012), and most recently the Japanese government has announced the decision to draft new rules covering disposal and recycling of decommissioned solar and wind power facilities. In the case of Japan, the government has grown frustrated with problems of illegal dumping as equipment ages and breaks, and unsuccessful operators (of which there have been many) exit the industry under financial duress.Prior to commencement of operations of the California Flats project, First Solar must submit a comprehensive recycling/disposal plan, including cost estimates, to Monterey County. The company must also post a bond with the county consistent with cost estimates. This requirement offers some reassurance. However, it is worth noting that as a result of its comments on the draft environmental impact report, First Solar was able to shift the sequencing of the submission of this report so that it was no longer a condition for issuance of the construction permits, but only a condition for issuance of operational permits. Given the momentum behind this project, one has to wonder what it would really take to prevent operations from commencing once construction is complete. Moreover, while First Solar emphasizes that the value of the materials in its panels creates powerful incentives to recycle as much of this material as possible, the test for the durability of any recycling commitment is really what happens if energy technologies evolve over the next 30 years and the materials have diminished value while the environmental impact of 5 million modules remains the same.First Solar and Apple have publicly assumed the role of environmental stewards. All to the good. And they will deserve whatever benefits fall to them if they properly exercise their stewardship. The companies have the opportunity to set the standard for commercial adoption of solar, which would transform the economy and our nation's energy consumption habits. But this standard must include explicit assumption of liabilities, including prefunding of these liabilities. To this degree, the obligations of First Solar and Apple are no different than the obligations of private companies that have assumed pension fund liabilities. One might say that solar PV collection, recycling, and disposal obligations for producers are fiduciary."}, {"title": "Plan for the Future: Use the Social Cost of Carbon", "text": "While scientists resoundingly agree that climate change is occurring, and that we should be taking action to address greenhouse-gas emissions now, opinion in Congress on the topic is dismayingly split.Recently, the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee reviewed legislation that contained a provision that took me aback: Bar government agencies from considering the social cost of increasing levels of carbon in their analyses and rules. That approach is dangerous to our environment, economy, and security.The social cost of carbon is the monetary estimate of how much small increases in carbon dioxide emissions would harm the economy. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), that damage can come in a decline in net agricultural productivity, human health, and property damages from increased flood risk.Scientists estimate that for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted, the economic damage could be worth as much as $220.As Duke University Professor Drew Shindell noted recently:[D]amages from a typical mid-range gasoline-powered vehicle total nearly $2,000 a year. In comparison, annual damages associated with an electric vehicle are around $1,000 if the power comes exclusively from coal, about $300 if the power is generated using natural gas, and minimal if the electricity is from renewable sources.The World Health Organization estimates that around 7 million people die per year as a result of air pollution exposure, and, as organizations across the board are noting, ocean acidification that hurts fisheries is a threat to both local economies and the people who rely on the ocean as a food source.While we are planning for the economic future we must also be considering how our economic growth will impact our public health and the sustainability of our communities. Including the social cost of carbon in policy and rule making is the smart, and responsible, thing to do.As our mothers taught us, we should pray for the best but prepare for the worst. That is why businesses and the military are leading the way in preparedness and resiliency efforts while pairing with the White House to reduce emissions from super pollutants like hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) and methane.Business leaders, insurance groups, and corporations are including the social cost of carbon and the changing climate in their business plans not for moral reasons but because it makes financial sense to plan ahead.The \"Risky Business\" report, published last year by a bipartisan group of business and government leaders, laid out the risks to American businesses should we not act to address the root causes of climate change while simultaneously preparing for the pending damage from increasingly extreme weather.As the report notes, and as Americans have witnessed first-hand, \"extremes will become the 'new normal.'\" Rising temperatures in California could reduce snowmelt into the Colorado River basin by 10 percent in the next 50 years and increase the number of extreme wildfires that have damaged communities across the West in recent years. Rising sea levels will threaten ports across the country, including in California, where 45 percent of all containers arrive in the U.S.It also states that if we continue on our current path, by 2050 between $66 billion and $106 billion worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide.Eighty-seven percent of all Californians, including coastal communities that I represent in San Diego, live in coastal counties, and 80 percent of the state's GDP is derived from those counties.The military, including Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, has also focused on climate change in their planning for the future security of our country. That doesn't arise from an environmental mission but because climate change will challenge our national security in new ways that require us to get to work preparing now.Let's take a cue from the Pentagon and the private sector -- enterprises that already account for the costs of carbon. The idea that we have to choose between economic growth and environmental sustainability is a false one and should be rejected.Barring agencies from including the social cost of carbon is not just a backward approach but one that threatens our country's ability to create high-quality jobs and to ensure our nation's future security. Congress should embrace the use of the social cost of carbon as a way to increase informed policy making."}, {"title": "Japan Gets The Boot Over Ties To Bloody Dolphin Hunt", "text": "Japanese zoos and aquariums obtain their dolphins in such a brutal way that they've been kicked out of the global zoo community until they end the practice.The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), an international community of 1,300 facilities, announced on Wednesday that it had unanimously voted to suspend the membership of the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA) due to concerns that JAZA members were obtaining captive dolphins from vicious Japanese drive hunts.Read more on The Dodo"}, {"title": "What You Need to Know About Heartworm", "text": "My passion is protecting dogs in all ways -- promoting spay and neuter to reduce the population of unwanted animals, encouraging people to rescue dogs from shelters, and helping them to find a balanced relationship that will make for a happy dog and happy humans.But I also want to protect dogs from disease, and there’s one killer lurking out there that is silent and invisible. If there are mosquitos in your area, then your dog is at risk. I’m going to share with you what you need to know about heartworm.While it’s most common on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, heartworm has been reported in all 50 states. It’s a parasite that spends part of its life cycle in a mosquito. One bite from an infected mosquito can transmit that parasite to your dog, where it develops further. Eventually, it grows into worms that can be up to a foot long, and which will infest your dog’s organs, particularly the heart and lungs.Luckily, dogs and cats cannot infect each other or humans with heartworm, and they cannot get it by sniffing feces of infected dogs or being around them in the dog park. The mosquito is the only method of transmission, which is why mosquito abatement programs are so important, and why you should never have standing, stagnant water around your property.From the time of infection, it can be up to six months before your dog shows symptoms. This is why annual testing is so important. Untreated, the condition is fatal. However, while it can be treated, if done in the later stages the process can be very expensive and the follow-up can be difficult. Although I always tell people that dogs need exercise, discipline, and affection, if your dog tests positive for heartworm, then their exercise needs to be restricted until after treatment has been completed, which can take months. During this time, too much physical activity can be deadly.Even after successful treatment, a dog can be infected again. Heartworm isn’t like the measles, where once you’ve had it you can never get it again. Protection against it is a lifelong need.To avoid infection, it’s important to have your dogs tested regularly, as well as to prevent the disease in the first place with an ivermectin-based medication. When your dog is taking the proper preventative, any heartworm larva transmitted to them by mosquitos will never develop to the next stage, and never become a threat to your dog’s health or life.There are rumors that you don’t have to give your dog treatment all year-round if you live where it gets cold, but this is no guarantee. While the larva will not survive in mosquitos if the temperature goes below 57° F (14° C), the mosquito only needs to bite another infected dog to start the cycle all over again. Missing a single dose of heartworm preventative or giving it late can make your dog vulnerable to infection, so it’s not worth the risk.If you love dogs like I do -- and I know you love your dogs -- the simple step of taking preventative measures now can insure that you’ll avoid this potentially fatal, difficult to treat disease. Remember: a Pack Leader’s job is to provide direction and protection. This is just another way to make sure that your dogs are protected, safe, and happy."}, {"title": "Inspiring Action on Climate Change and Protecting America's Birds", "text": "What can I do? That's the question Audubon hears most frequently when people learn that there may be no Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore or Common Loons nesting in our northern states by the end of the century.In a study based on decades of data, our scientists found that if climate change continues on its current trajectory, 314 U.S. and Canadian bird species -- more than half of the 588 species studied -- could lose 50 percent or more of their current ranges by the year 2080. Many could lose so much ground that, without urgent action, they could face extinction.Our study is a road map for action, from simple steps anyone can take in their own backyard to speaking up about the future boundaries of national parks and collective efforts to address climate change.So, when people ask me, \"What can I do?\" I tell them, here's what's working:Young people are powerful agents of personal and collective changeOur kids get it. Birds don't have a political party. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It's a bird issue. And young people know it's their issue.Young people were the messengers that led the anti-litter campaigns of the '70s and the recycling efforts of the '80s -- all of which are part of mainstream culture today -- and they did that without regard for political affiliation.Audubon is engaging young people across America: Last week, teenagers lobbied state legislators for climate solutions in Washington. Through an Audubon program, middle school students are becoming community advocates in inner-city Baltimore neighborhoods. And in Madison, Wisconsin, students of all ages are training to become citizen scientists.Citizen science is making climate change a more personal -- and less political -- issueWhen people see change in their own communities, they get it. And people who watch birds are seeing changes. Birds are leaving later and coming back earlier, or not at all. New birds are showing up in places that they didn't used to live. And by recording all those observations, people are doing two things: They're recognizing changes in their communities, and they're contributing the information that's needed to make a difference.New tools, including apps, smartphones, and map-based technologies, are making it easier than ever for anyone to be a citizen scientist.For instance, our Hummingbirds at Home project engages thousands of participants across the United States to submit sightings of these tiny gems of the bird world along with their nectar-feeding preferences. This collective data will help scientists better understand how hummingbirds are responding to climate change and how we can help them adjust to a warming world, where their migration schedules are increasingly out of sync with the blooming flowers on which they depend.From Mississippi to Denver to the Pacific Coast, I haven't met anyone who doesn't love hummingbirds.People can make a difference in their own backyardsThe stronger that bird populations are today, the better their chances for surviving and adapting to threats posed by global warming. That's why each and every personal action taken on behalf of birds matters. Imagine if every home, condo or apartment on your block made room for bird-friendly native plants or for more hummingbird feeders. Put all of those together and you know what that's called? A sanctuary. Right there in your neighborhood.Here's another example. In North Carolina, we're partnering with community groups to install 10,000 nest boxes for brown-headed nuthatches, lively little backyard birds with a call that sounds like a rubber-duck squeaky toy. Similar birdhouse projects have helped bring back the Eastern bluebird, and conservationists are hoping the nesting-box campaign will give nuthatches the help they need to survive deforestation and urbanization, as well as the grave threats this bird faces from climate change.New tools are assisting conservationists, urban planners, and natural-resource managersAudubon's birds and climate study provides conservationists and policy makers new analytical tools to identify the places that birds need now and will need in the future so that they can thrive. Conservation groups, state agencies, natural-resource managers, and other partners are using the detailed maps and science from the study to make long-range conservation plans.Talking about your #ClimateThing mattersWe could quote reams of science about the ecological importance of birds.But birds also matter because people take them personally. Whether it's the melody of a Northern cardinal on a soft spring morning or the faraway honking of migrating geese on a crisp fall evening, birds evoke memories.Audubon members want to make sure there are plenty of birds around so our kids and their kids can make those memories, too. For us, birds are a #ClimateThing. They make climate change personal, and they inspire us to act. That is working.Whether your #ClimateThing is birds, clean water, or your kids, join the conversation on social media, and then take action. There is something everyone can do. The important thing is to get started.David Yarnold is President and CEO of National Audubon Society.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Fingers are being jabbed at almond milk obsessed hipsters and the blogosphere is swimming with alternatives to the popular dairy alternative, from kefir to obscure grain milks and \"less thirsty\" nuts. Has there ever been a witch hunt of this scale for a snack food? It's nuts!We wouldn't be almond shaming if the world weren't on the fritz, right? Boston is only just thawing from its snowiest year on record and on the opposite coast, there are towns in California that have run out of water entirely. Last September's People's Climate March drew more than 400,000 supporters to the streets of NYC. This came just days before the U.N.'s climate summit on environmental action, where world leaders declared urgent action in areas like agriculture, energy and industry. Earth Day 2015 marks the 45th anniversary of what many consider to be the birth of the modern environmental movement in 1970 and it seems that, more than ever, the world is standing in solidarity in the face of the rapidly warping state of our urban and natural environments.In an ideal world, everyone would be able to afford to install solar panels on their homes, plant-based diets would sweep our national consciousness and be so common as to seem the norm and climate change naysayers would be the ridiculous remnants of an ignorant past. Our world, however, is one that's wobbling on a tipping point. Not everyone has the means to effect sweeping changes in their communities overnight, regardless of how passionately they believe in more sustainable lifestyles. Starting at the individual level, though -- that's doable! And if we all strived to master these manageable, personal lifestyle changes, the impact could be substantial:If you'd like to eat to your health and the environment's, think more peas and beans, which can absorb nitrogen from the air; onions, asparagus and other members of the \" Clean 15.\""}, {"title": "Earthly", "text": "All politics are local, all days are Earth's.

Today, with climate change, our problem is that we are all part of the problem, leaving many of us feeling powerless to contribute much to solutions. Yet until each of us takes up our piece of the problem, there will be no solution.  In drought-besieged California, for example, where I have an office, the \"water-cooler conversation\" often turns these days to water: How many showers are you taking now? What are you doing to capture and reuse the water? Is soapy water harmful to plants? After a while, inevitably, someone comments on how futile these well-meaning gestures seem in response to a massive crisis. And then the question becomes, \"What else?\" The answer: \"Get to work.\"  What's working now is that many of us are going to work on this problem. If we raise our voices and organize, there are three important goals we can target right away. We can send our national leaders to Paris in December with the political backing they need to commit our nation to lead. We can put Congress on notice that we want a price on carbon that captures the costs of pollution. And we can elect politicians who will fight for our children's future.  We humans are standing at a precipice toward which we have been marching blindly for decades. It is time to take off our blinders. In the story of the universe, a continuous unfolding over some 13.7-billion years, the time that we humans have had on Earth has been miniscule. And now our place is precarious, seven-billion strong and multiplying fast. We face environmental tests that require a total reordering of political, economic, and social systems that are threatening life itself.  Widening gaps between rich and poor are exacerbating the calamities that befall the poor first. Governments are selling out to a rich and vast rogue industry, doubling down to protect private profits at public expense. Many of today's leaders still doubt the established facts of climate science, emboldened by disinformation campaigns that confound the issues, discredit science and scientists, and disable democratic decision-making by promoting ignorance and fear.  Fear is paralyzing, but hope liberates. Hope resides in the human spirit, in our ability to feel, to pay attention, to comprehend and, from there, to act. Hope resides within the fabric of our relationships, and fuels curiosity and inquiry. Hope is an act of creation, an act of connection, an act of determination to imagine new ways of seeing and being in the world.  I know this personally because I have been immersed in the fear/hope cauldron of climate change for over two years. It started in a circle of 12 women (scientists, artists, writers, teachers and scholars) who made a commitment to spend time together to \"get real\" about the ecological crisis and to inquire what it asks of us.  In a \"Council on the Uncertain Human Future,\" hosted by the Clark University humanities center, we explored what is known and not known and asked about implications. We opened to the grief that lies beneath what the scientists and artists are seeing. And, in the affection and connection of the circle, in the depths we discovered in ourselves and one another, we began to emerge, each of us, with a clearer picture of who it is we can be in this emergency, and how we can bring ourselves most skillfully to it.  The organizer, Sarah Buie, has been consulting with other academic groups around the world interested in organizing similar conversations. Back home this spring she and Clark colleagues led a day-long teach-in on the climate that they hope will transform their university, and inspire others.  Meanwhile, across the country, many groups are emerging and finding new possibilities for inner development through their interconnections, as an antidote to decades of addiction to outer, material growth. Scientists were among the first to see the need for a different kind of communication of what is at stake. Many have responded with courageous and persuasive messages.  Students and faculty on college campuses have been mobilizing their institutions to assume bold leadership roles that cross boundaries and unite scholars in ambitious collaborations. Mothers are organizing as activist groups; grandparents are on the move; religious leaders are coming together and speaking out; so are astronauts. And scores of national and international environmental nonprofits are communicating with increasing urgency, clarity, and cogency why we should care, and what we can do.  And so, to the question, \"What is working in climate change?,\" I say \"leadership.\" Leadership of a particular kind: grounded in empathy, compassion and ethics, intent on building collective intelligence and webs of interconnection that will be dense, durable and diverse enough for the long haul. This is a new kind of grassroots leadership for the Anthropocene Age. We can hope it is what will be needed, finally, to move us from our dysfunctional habits toward a life-enhancing future focused on the common good."}, {"title": "50 Things I'm Grateful for About the Earth -- An #EarthGratitude List", "text": "1.

Berkeley agricultural library writing Diet for a Small Planet.Never could I have imagined that on this Earth Day I'd be celebrating at the EPA, enjoying a cafeteria-featured lunch of Texas Vegan BBQ. For this girl from Fort Worth -- nicknamed \"cow town\" -- it felt a bit surreal.Asked to speak in honor of Earth Day, I was delighted. I couldn't wait to share the big ah-ha's I'd been saving up during two years of writing, with Joseph Collins, World Hunger: 10 Myths, to be released in the fall.In 1970, what triggered Diet for a Small Planet was the shock of learning that we smart Homo sapiens were actively shrinking our food supply by feeding a third of the world's grain to livestock that return to us only a small fraction of what they eat. We are creating scarcity from plenty. I was dumbfounded.And here we are today. In the same place -- but worse, much worse.Worldwide, livestock use three-quarters of all agricultural land but supply us with only 17 percent of our calories. Cattle are the least efficient converters of feed to food: From calories in the feed that cattle eat, we humans get only three percent in the animal flesh we eat.Only by letting these numbers sink in, does the following comparison become believable:Because the United States eats the most meat per capita (with one exception: Luxembourg), and uses more than half of our cropped land for feed and fuel, our agriculture feeds fewer people per acre than Chinese or Indian agriculture. What a stunner, given the widespread view of U.S agriculture as the model of efficiency.In 1970, no one was listening to the handful of scientists warning us that we might be wrecking the climate. So of course I had no idea that our grain-fed meat diet would become not only a grain-disappearing act but a climate curse as well.Producing a pound of lamb or beef averages from about 20 to almost 50 times greater climate impact than does producing high-protein plant foods.Overall, livestock are responsible for at least 14.5 percent of all human-generated greenhouse gas emissions, reports the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization -- not only in their raising, but also via transport, processing, refrigeration, and more. That's as much as the transportation sector.And, while climate change makes water more and more precious, livestock are huge water guzzlers. In drought-plagued California, for example, meat and dairy account for almost half of the entire state's water footprint. A fifth of its irrigation water goes to a single feed crop, alfalfa. So even as water scarcity worsens, every year 100 billion gallons of California water in the form of alfalfa go to China for meat production there.   From Curse to Climate CureAt the same, transforming the way we farm and eat can be a key part of the climate cure. And the especially good news?This change directly engages and benefits some of the world's poorest people -- smallholders in the Global South and their families who produce most of the world's food. Organic farming per unit of land releases just a third as much carbon dioxide as industrial farming. And small producers, learning ecological farming -- and freeing themselves from costly chemical inputs -- find their net incomes improving.Not only does agroecology mean fewer emissions, it is also a big plus for sequestering carbon. One study of the EU found that, if agroecology spread, it would have the technical potential to sequester 37 percent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. Most of that contribution to storing carbon would come from agroforestry -- the mixing of trees and crops, which can enhance productivity as well.It's already happening in West Africa. In one of the world's poorest countries, Niger, farmers nurturing trees in their fields have \"regreened\" 12.5 million acres with 200 million trees. The result is both more carbon sequestered and food security for about 2.5 million people.For so many reasons, profound policy changes are in order to support ecological farming of the Niger variety, and to encourage climate-friendly, plant-centered diets. And take note, if Americans ate even the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, we'd save ourselves in medical costs alone $17 billion yearly, the Union of Concerned Scientists reports.I've been eating \"with the Earth\" since 1970. I love it. True, my eating habits won't change the world. But long ago I discovered something. They change me. The more I align with the Earth, the stronger and more convincing I feel I become.So on Earth Day 2015, that vegan burger tastes really good."}, {"title": "Common Insecticide Affects Bees Like Cigarettes Affect Humans, Studies Find", "text": "Bees may be getting buzzed on a harmful insecticide contributing to their massive decline, researchers reported Wednesday.Two studies released by the journal Nature found that neonicotinoids, a common type of insecticide chemically related to nicotine, are both harmful and attractive to bees, much like cigarettes are to humans.“What I think is happening is that neonicotinoids are essentially having a pharmacological effect on the neurons in the bees’ brains,” study author Geraldine Wright said at a press conference, Take Part reported. “Like nicotine, they’re essentially amplifying the rewarding qualities of the sucrose solution. The bees think it’s more rewarding so they go back to that tube to drink more of it ... As soon as it gets into their blood, they are getting a ‘buzz.’”The other study echoed findings from past research that indicate insecticides may be contributing to bee decline, known as colony collapse disorder. Researchers compared 16 rapeseed fields, eight treated with neonicotinoids and eight untreated. Over time, they found that honeybee density remained unchanged in both fields, but wild bee density was about half the size in the treated field of what it was in the insecticide-free one.“I’m worried about the effects on wild bees,” study author Maj Rundlöf told Nature in a press release.The bees' different responses alerted Rundlöf to a possible problem with past attempts to understand colony collapse disorder. “Honeybees are the model organism that is used in toxicity testing for pesticides,” she said, which could explain why other studies have not identified negative effects.The current, unexplained decline in bee populations came to light in 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture notes, when some beekeepers began reporting 30-90 percent hive loss. About one-third of crops from western nations rely on bees' role as pollinators, National Geographic notes, and they contribute more than $15 billion to U.S. crop production.The studies' findings come at a critical time, as the U.S. is currently reevaluating its stance on insecticides. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was not likely to approve applications for new uses of neonicotinoids until new bee data and pollinator risk assessments are complete.Neonicotinoids have come under scrutiny for their effect on bees for several years, but agricultural organizations have contested limiting their use and scientists stand on both sides of the argument, Nature reports. Amid the debate, the European Union decided to implement a two-year moratorium in 2013 following a European Food Safety Authority report that identified \"high acute risks\" for bees exposed to some crops. They will revisit the ban at the end of this year, taking any relevant research into account.At least eight U.S. cities have also banned them, with Portland, Oregon, doing so earlier this month."}, {"title": "8 Badass Environmentalists You Should Know", "text": "In honor of Earth Day and Arbor Day, we're celebrating eight extraordinary women who have continuously advocated and rallied for our earth.These women work endlessly to implement policies and enact change to preserve and protect our environment -- from waterways, forests, access to clean air, oceans and mountains to the precious wildlife that reside within these ecosystems.The challenges we face today, especially with the onset of climate change, have opened new opportunities in the environmental sector that has long been filled by men. The progress that has been made by these remarkable women is illustrative of just how dynamic the feminine power really is.1. Dr. Jane GoodallDr. Goodall is considered one the world's foremost experts on chimpanzees and ecology. It is hard to overstate the degree to which she has changed and enriched the field of primatology.During her 55-year research study, she defied scientific convention by giving the Gombe chimps names instead of numbers, and insisted on the validity of her observations that animals have distinct personalities, minds and emotions. She has harnessed the power of the feminine, instilling such into every aspect of her work -- from her research studies to her global work through the Jane Goodall Institute and Roots & Shoots program, which aim to raise awareness and action for endangered species and vulnerable habitats.Dr. Goodall has transformed the epistemological framework of how we study primates, and has exemplified immeasurable ecological integrity. She will forever be a leading voice in the environmental movement worldwide.If you haven't heard the exciting news yet, she is our keynote speaker at Emerging Live this year in San Francisco, and we hope you'll join us to share in the energy of this legendary woman!2. Julia Butterfly HillIn 1997, Julia Butterfly Hill stormed onto the environmental activist scene in Northern California with her courageous 738-day protest living in an old-growth redwood tree, nicknamed Luna. This incredible act of civil disobedience saved the tree from being cut down by the Pacific Lumber Company and resulted in the raised international awareness for sustainable forest management techniques and the importance of establishing safeguards to protect old-growth trees.Today, Hill continues her work as an activist, motivational speaker and founder of the Circle of Life Foundation, a non-profit that trains community leaders to enact social change. Her invincible spirit is illustrative of the immense power that the feminine holds, and the tenets of her legacy -- love, courage, devotion -- are of immense significance and have made the environmental movement undeniably stronger.\"You, yes you, make the difference.\" ~ Julia Butterfly Hill3. Frances BeineckeAs the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Frances has worked tirelessly across political spectrums to strategically develop and execute the organization's program of work; focusing on curbing global warming, protecting our oceans and endangered ecosystems, developing a clean energy future, addressing toxic chemicals and greening our global economy.Beinecke has been instrumental in igniting our global discourse on climate change. She was appointed in 2010 to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling by President Obama. She co-authored The World We Create: A Message of Hope for a Planet in Peril. She is the recipient of the Audubon Society's Rachel Carson Award, and her environmental stewardship has been honored by numerous other environmental entities. She is an incredible woman and a force to be reckoned with.4. Winona LaDukeWinona LaDuke is an environmentalist, social activist, economist, speaker, professor and writer. She is of Ojibwe ancestry. She began her career in education on the White Earth Indian Reservation in Northern Minnesota, and soon realized the injustices that many American Indians, especially women, faced, which led her to found the Indigenous Women's Network.She is also the founder of White Earth Land Recovery Project, which fights for the retrieval of 837,000 acres of land to their original native American owners. Passionate about Native Environmentalism, she leads Honor the Earth, a non-profit that raises awareness and funding for environmental injustices-such as climate change, renewable energy, and sustainable development.Bold, brazen, and unrelentingly dedicated to our earth, Winona LaDuke is a leading global voice on environmental issues and sustainability for American Indians and Indigenous Peoples and communities everywhere.    5. Dr. Sylvia EarleA National Geographic Society Explorer-in-Residence, Dr. Sylvia Earle (dubbed \"Her Deepness\" by the New Yorker, \"Hero for the Planet\" by Time magazine, and an \"environmental badass\" by us here at Emerging Women) is an oceanographer, explorer, author and lecturer.She has extensive experience as a field research scientist, government official, and director for corporate and nonprofit organizations, and is the former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.In the 1960s, she fought to join male-only expeditions, and has since clocked 7,000 hours of diving, several of which were to record breaking depths. In addition to her PhD. from Duke University, she has 22 honorary degrees, has penned more than than 190 publications, and speaks all over the world, focusing on preserving oceanic biodiversity in the wake of climate change.Thanks to Dr. Earle and her fearless curiosity we know more about our oceans today than ever before. Her lifetime of work has enriched us with a deeper understanding of how to live sustainably and symbiotically with marine life, and our oceans are healthier because of her commitment to environmentalism.\"The only thing that men can do down there that women can't is grow beards.\" ~ Dr. Sylvia Earle on gender equality and deep sea diving6. Lois GibbsEnvironmentalism claimed Gibbs, perhaps even before she could claim it. In 1978, Gibbs discovered that her son's elementary school in Niagara Falls, New York, was built on a toxic waste dump. Investigations revealed that her entire neighborhood, named Love Canal, had been constructed on top of this toxic site. Lois took to her neighborhood and organized a grassroots movement and battled for years against state and federal government.After years of fighting, nearly 1,000 families were evacuated and a massive cleanup of Love Canal began. Gibbs' efforts led to the creation of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, a superfund within the US Environmental Protection Agency which is utilized to clean up toxic waste sites throughout America.Lois Gibbs went on to to form a grassroots environmental crisis center, the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, where she currently serves as Executive Director. Love Canal is considered one of the nation's worst environmental disasters, and Gibbs' fearless heart and feminine leadership has transformed the way the U.S. handles toxic waste sites, and for that, our communities are healthier and safer.7. Peggy ShepardPeggy Shepard is arguably the most important proponent of environmental justice issues in communities of color in the country. She is founder of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a non-profit she created in 1988 to improve the environmental health and quality of life for communities of color in New York City.Shepard also serves as an investigator for Columbia University's Children's Environmental Health Center and is working to open partnerships between researchers and clinicians and local community members to increase environmental health education and outreach.Shepard was the first female chair of the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, a position she held from 2001-2003. She is the recipient of numerous awards including the Heinz Award for the Environment, the Jane Jacobs Medal for Lifetime Achievement, and the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization of Women. She remains extremely active in the environmental justice field and lectures often at universities nationwide. Her environmental consciousness is one of integrity and is an amazing leader with a passion for fairness and justice for underrepresented communities that is unmatchable.    8. Laurie DavidLaurie David burst onto the environmental stage in 2006 with her Academy Award-winning film An Inconvenient Truth. The film received international acclaim and is considered to be a catalyst for significantly increasing global awareness of climate change and for re-energizing the environmental movement. She serves as a trustee on the Natural Resources Defense Council, is the founder of the Stop Global Warming Virtual March, and the creator of Earth to America!, a film raising environmental awareness with a comedic stance.David is heavily involved in public education and advocacy campaigns, and is involved in lobbying the automotive industry and Congress to increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles with her creation of the Detroit Project. Laurie David is a leading voice in the environmental movement and has utilized her unique position in the entertainment industry to promote and raise awareness of global environmental issues, amplifying participation and the accessibility of environmentalism.\"Everybody has to look at his or her own footprint and do the best they can.

All photos courtesy of Rebecca Dameron.By Rebecca Dameron for Fathom | Founded in 1892, Sierra Club has been protecting and conserving our environment long before global warming and GMOs entered the vernacular. Longtime member and environmental activist Rebecca Dameron believes in the importance of giving back to our environment. She tells her tale as leader of the Sierra Club's Appalachian Kayaking service trip.Tell us about the trip.The Appalachian Kayak Service Trip started at the request of a National Park ranger who liked to kayak and wanted to see clean-up work done in Lake Santeetlah, North Carolina. I love kayaking and service opportunities, so it felt like a wonderful fit! This is the fifth year the trip has taken place. We camp near the lake and spend each day collecting litter on kayaks. So far we've collected over 6,000 pounds of trash. We also repair tent pads at water-accessible only campsites. Depending on which campsites we work at, we get to paddle through and enjoy the beauty of a great deal of the 3,000-acre lake. The main goal is to get people out into the North Carolina Mountains and do work that improves the amazing experience of being on the lake. It's a beautiful place and a popular spot for many grassroots environmental organizations.How did you get involved?I grew up loving the outdoors, playing and exploring in my own backyard and taking long, cross-country camping trips with my family in the summers. In 1986 I joined Sierra Club to have an active role in protecting the environment, which I had come to love so much. Like many other Sierra Club members who are passionate environmentalists, I now lead national and international outings. I focus on service trips because I believe in giving back and encouraging others to do the same.All lined up and ready to clean.Why Sierra Club?Sierra Club and its many followers do great work for the environment. The Club runs educational programs, outings (local, national, international) and host outings for military personnel and inner-city children. Its monthly magazine, Sierra, educates people around the country about environmental awareness. Offering unique specialty programs really sets it apart from other environmental organizations.Sierra Club also has several campaigns such as Beyond Coal, Beyond Oil and Our Wild America that educate people about critical environmental issues and encourage them to learn about the use of sustainable resources. One thing that has impressed me about Sierra Club is the flexibility of the staff — they are more than willing to change their programs based on results and feedback. The Beyond Coal campaign has moved from just opposing coal processing plants and the use of coal to dialoguing with willing coal companies and employees to create alternative jobs and economies in the energy industry. Willingness to address environmental issues as they arise has allowed Sierra Club to exist for as long as it has and to grow into such a dynamic organization.What's your favorite part about the Appalachian kayaking service trip?Kayaking in the North Carolina mountains, listening to the bugs at night, working with the National Forest staff, getting caught in a late summer rain shower and warming and drying by the evening campfire.What's the most challenging experience you've had as a leader?I was physically challenged by my second kayaking service trip in Alaska's Kenai Fjords National Park. It rained every single day, making it impossible to paddle. Because it pushed my limits, it's one of the best trips I ever went on. I'd like to offer the experience of testing personal limits to others. Its unbelievably rewarding.Hard at work.What should volunteers expect from this trip?Hard work, a fun time and a great group of folks.Who should go on this trip?Anyone who loves the mountains, appreciates doing service work and enjoys kayaking and camping.What is your favorite thing about working in the Appalachians?The beauty of the ancient ridged mountains and the cultural history of the area. It's been home to a wealth of different cultures, from the Cherokee to the Scottish-Irish immigrants, and their traces are everywhere.Tell us about a favorite moment from your trip.I've been leading trips for four years, so there are too many to count. One moment that sticks out was when we had to cook dinner under the tarp during a huge rain shower. People were sitting around occasionally punching the tarp with spatulas to dump the water off the top so it wouldn't collapse.Have you ever led another trip with Sierra Club?I lead another service trip in the Nantahala National Forest in the spring. I've also assisted on many Florida kayaking trips. I've recently begun to lead the Coast to Coast Walk in England, where participants trek through three national parks and learn about life in rural England from locals. I also lead a cross-country ski trip in Alaska, a service trip with the Alaska State Parks and the Nellie Juan-College Fjord Wilderness Kayaking Trip in the Prince William Sound, the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. You could say I'm pretty involved.Sunset over the Appalachians.BECOME ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE Get SchooledFirst and foremost, educate yourself about ways you can reduce your energy consumption. Take it one step at a time: Take showers instead of baths; recycle, or buy less items with plastic packaging. Learn why these steps are important and how what seem like such small actions can make a huge difference.Get InvolvedLearn about a local environmental concerns. Go to meetings, volunteer, learn more. Most environmental issues are not black and white. Not every problem has a simple solution, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to find the solutions that work best.Get FocusedNo one can save the world overnight. Pick a few things, even just one, and focus. Hard. Find where your passion lies and immerse yourself completely in that issue.

It was a different time. There was bipartisan support for regulating dirty factories, toxic dumps, polluted water, and the loss of wilderness. President Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and enacted most of our environmental laws. President Ronald Reagan designated 10.6 million acres as protected land and ratified the Montreal Protocol to reduce gases that deplete the Earth's ozone layer.People, both liberals and conservatives, saw the value in cleaning up our act and living sustainably.Now, 45 years later, the environmental movement has changed. A sharp line divides environmentalists to the left and everyone else to the right. There's a common misconception that if you're for the environment, you're against humankind -- you can't have trees and jobs; renewable energy and affordable energy; healthy food and available food.But faith groups are challenging these preconceived notions and creating an environmentalism that is as good for us as it is for the birds, bees, and polar bears.Environmentalism for the Poor and VulnerableWhen the EPA proposed rules to regulate carbon emissions last June, faith groups voiced their overwhelming support. Their reasoning ranged from a moral obligation from God to protect the planet -- an idea of stewardship -- to a concern about the wellbeing of vulnerable communities that will be the hardest hit by environmental damage. In other words, they saw that protecting the environment was also a way to protect the safety and health of people.\"Climate change disproportionately impacts the very people who we are called to serve,\" said Patricia Bruckbauer, an eco-justice fellow at Creation Justice Ministries. \"Those who have consistently contributed the least to our changing climate are generally the ones who suffer the most ... low-income communities, communities of color, the elderly and children.\"\"This is not about polar bears; it's not about future life; it's about current reality and children's health,\" Rev. Mitch Hescox, a Republican and president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, said in a telephone interview. \"We're not going to get anywhere if it remains a liberal issue.\"\"As people of faith called to care for God's people and Creation, especially the most vulnerable, we have a moral obligation to address the profound impacts of the way we use energy,\" said Rev. Canon Sally G. Bingham, President and Founder of Interfaith Power & Light. \"In addition to protecting our climate, curbing pollution from power plants offers many important benefits, including saving lives and reducing health risks to those suffering from heart disease and respiratory ailments such as asthma.\"A New, More \"Godly\" Economic SystemLike American faith groups, Pope Francis sees a relationship between ecological devastation and human suffering. But, to him, environmentalism isn't just about safeguarding health and environmental justice. It's about worshiping the God of Creation instead of golden idols.Speaking at a conference for the poor, unemployed, and landless last October, Pope Francis denounced an \"economic system centered on the god of money\" that needs to \"plunder nature to sustain the frenetic rhythm of consumption that is inherent to it.\" According to Pope Francis, the \"humble, those who live near coasts in precarious dwellings or who are so vulnerable economically that, in face of a natural disaster, lose everything\" will be the ones to suffer from environmental degradation.Catholic bishops from around the world have picked up Pope Francis's message and urged world leaders to act on climate change. Writing to negotiators at the UN climate talks in Lima last winter, the bishops said, \"We recognize that much good has happened on Earth through the rightful and responsible intelligence, technology and industry of humankind under God's love care. And yet in recent decades many grave adversities such as climate change, with its devastating impact on Nature itself, on food security, health and migration, led to a great number of suffering people worldwide.\"The Non-BelieversAlthough more and more religious leaders and faith groups are working to protect the environment, there are still those that hold on to the false belief that you can't be for the environment and for people.Calvin Beisner, spokesman for the conservative Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, has declared the U.S. environmental movement to be \"un-biblical\" and a false religion, and even Jesus probably couldn't convince him otherwise. He has published articles to confuse Christians about the science of climate change. He has made false claims that helping the environment will hurt the poor. And his group has released a video urging Christians to \"resist the Green Dragon.\" Last December, Beisner even had the cojones to tell the Pope to \"back off\" with his environmental claims. Unsurprisingly, the Pope hasn't responded to Beisner.It would be easy to dismiss Beisner and his friends, like Rush Limbaugh, as just misguided members of the fringe, if conservative politicians who receive donations from the oil and gas industry didn't use their talking points.Case in point: anti-environmental, climate-change denier Senator James Inhofe who ironically serves as the Chairman for the Committee on the Environment and Public Works. He has said that it is arrogant \"to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what [God] is doing in the climate\" -- a talking point of both Beisner and Limbaugh. This religious rhetoric is quite convenient for Inhofe who receives substantial contributions from the Koch brothers and the oil and gas industry.Re-Centering the Environmental MovementFortunately, religious leaders and faith groups are raising their voices louder for the environment and drowning out the non-believers. They are holding banners, attending hearings, publishing their own articles, and releasing their own videos. Evangelical scientists are making the case for climate change and calling for action. Religious leaders and congregations are working to protect communities at risk of environmental degradation. And organizations representing millions of Christians are divesting from fossil fuels.And while this work is important to the environment, it's also important to the environmental movement because it brings it back to the center. Faith groups are bridging the divide and creating an environmentalism that liberals and conservatives can agree upon -- an environmentalism that protects the trees, the polar bears, and us.EdenKeeper is an information source for those interested in the connection between religion and the environment.

A large chunk of this, $57.4 million, was invested in Anadarko Petroleum, one of the companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Several other companies Harvard invests in are involved in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Harvard's continued financial support of the fossil fuel industry comes despite a referendum in 2012 that shows 72 percent of Harvard students favor divestment.At two of the world's most influential universities, the focus on global warming at both an establishment and grassroots level could signal a renewed push among academic circles to force action on climate change.\"The IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says by the beginning of the next century, 25 to 50 percent of species on earth will be extinct, if business continues as usual,\" said Hansen at MIT, adding that even if global temperatures rise by only 2 degrees Celsius, a commonly cited goal to avoid the most devastating potential effects of global warming, it would still cause an emergency. \"There would be a sea-level rise of several meters, meaning coastal cities would be virtually destroyed.\"If anyone embodies the marriage of academia and civil disobedience, it's Hansen. In 1988, he became one of the first scientists to testify to the US Congress on the link between pollution and a heating planet. And from 1981 to 2013, he worked for the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. But in the 2000s, his approach became more confrontational.Hansen appeared in a 60 Minutes episode in 2006 saying George Bush's administration had watered down press releases on climate change by federal agencies, making them seem less perilous. In 2009, he was arrested protesting mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia. He was then arrested in 2011 and again 2013 in front of the White House protesting the Keystone XL pipeline.Such determination can be felt on Harvard's campus, where demonstrators risked arrest for blocking entrances to Massachusetts Hall, the campus's oldest building, forcing administrators to work elsewhere. Campus police have refrained from taking any action on the crowd, though, and interactions have been amicable.Students play music and laugh with a young boy and a Harvard Univesity police officer.\"Fossil fuels corporations spend so much money lobbying Congress, funding climate deniers, and defaming research ... so a lot of the responsibility comes down on those corporations,\" said Naima Drecker-Waxman, a Harvard freshman at the protest. \"That's why we want to rebrand and politically bankrupt them and retake our democracy.\"The problem of money in politics is echoed by Hansen, who calls it one of the principle hindrances to enacting effective public policy to protect the environment. At the event, Hansen stood tall with scanning green-blue eyes and occasionally let a slow smile cross his face. Now in his mid-70s, he did not have on his Indiana Jones-like brown safari hat that has become a personal trademark.While speaking and reaching down to change slides on his laptop, he voiced a patient, sarcastic sense of humor.At one point, after describing some of the environmental crises ahead, he paused and said, \"So there are some incentives to figuring out this problem.\"The crowd of mostly professors and students laughed accordingly.Hansen began his career by studying the atmosphere of Venus, but switched to Earth when he realized that \"a planet with a changing atmosphere and consequences for billions of people is far more interesting.\" He now heads Columbia University's Department of Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions.At MIT, Hansen spoke about how America's East Coast experienced anomalous cold weather this winter, but that the year overall could still be among the hottest on record. His most immediate warning, though, was the dangerous disjunction between science and policy.A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that over 56 percent of Republicans deny or question the science behind human-induced climate change. With such a sizable minority opposing meaningful legislation to curb carbon emissions, Washington has failed to act in the timeframe needed to address the crisis. Many congressmen and women who deny global warming receive campaign contributions from oil companies.For both Hansen and divestment protesters at Harvard, activism is a crucial conduit to breaking through political and institutional paralysis. Already, many institutions and universities around the world have announced plans to divest.\"It sends a message that the business model of the fossil fuel industry is so destructive that we can't engage with them anymore, and that we need to demand that our political leaders don't engage with them either,\" said Sidni Frederick, a sophomore who studies history and literature. \"It's part of a larger movement against thinking that reckless, unaccountable profit seeking is okay.\""}, {"title": "Composting With Coppola at Blancaneaux Lodge, Belize", "text": "We've all been transfixed by Francis Ford Coppola's awesome oeuvre of films, but did you know his genius also extends to eco-friendly jungle hideaways? Blancaneaux Lodge, tucked deep in a corner of Belize's Maya Mountains, is one of three sumptuous properties in Central America owned by the filmmaker, who also has a fabulous fourth in Italy.The magic of Blancaneaux is the seamless way it marries mindfulness with luxury travel. Accommodations are artful cabañas and villas constructed with screen walls and open air decks and lounges, inviting guests to truly immerse themselves in nature. Yoga mats tucked into each closet encourage guests to stretch their bodies and spirits while telescopes invite you to contemplate the cosmos close up.Unlike some destinations that use green or holistic accents as the decoration du jour, Blancaneaux actually walks the sustainability walk. In fact, it struts.In 1993, the Coppolas installed a hefty hydro-electric plant that harnesses the muscle of Privassion Creek, which gorgeously gurgles through the property. Any electricity that isn't used in guest rooms or on general operations is diverted to the hot pool at the Waterfall Spa -- which is maintained at a toasty 100 degrees, perfect for a mid-day or late night dip.Blancaneaux is also home to a lush 3 ½ -acre organic garden that supplies all the tasty vegetables and most of the fruit used in the property's two restaurants. Thanks to the blissful weather of the region, the garden team grows a vast range of produce all year that includes lettuces, herbs, beans and tomatoes through careful planning and crop rotation.With such bounty, keeping the soil healthy is key. How does the Blancaneaux team do it? Compost, compost, compost!During a private garden tour, I learned about the resort's super soil practices, large-scale compost strategy, and gardening techniques. Here are some highlights from my chat with Blancaneaux's General Manager Bernie Matute -- who in his spare time also runs his family's 100+ acre organic fruit farm!Please tell me a little bit about the history of this gorgeous garden!BM: At the initial stage, we got assistance from [educator, organic farmer, photographer and writer] Michael Ableman, who inspired our staff with his teachings about having a rotating crop to raise the quantities required to operate both restaurants. Staffing the farm happened very gradually.What was the soil like when you started the garden?The soil is acidic and intolerable to the growth of any other plant except natives such as Guava and Custard Apple (Annona reticulata). Top soil has to be trucked in to build up raised beds. We make the beds out of discarded wood slabs from our wood supplier at the progressive Mennonites, who give us a variety of barba jolote, mahogany and bullet tree. Compost is added as a fertilizer and also to soften the soil.How did composting become a part of your farm practice?Because we had horse stables and all the trimmings of the landscape, we thought that composting would be a good use for all of the additional material on the property. It would also reduce our garbage. This was around 1998.What is your compost set up like?We have 6 rotating pits filled with about 900 pounds of horse manure, 250 pounds of kitchen waste, 1200 pounds of chicken manure and 1 gallon of molasses. In a week, we accumulate the kitchen waste by combining two of our kitchens. We have 50 chickens which we raise for eggs and 16 horses in our stables. We add chicken manure for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which is a deficiency in the soil, and additional manure is collected from the farms of the progressive Mennonites who live in the area.How do you manage the piles?Once the ingredients are put together, they are soaked with water and left to stand for one week. After the seventh day, the garden staff will start to turn over the compost. At this stage, rubber gloves and gas masks are used to protect the staff and EM Microorganisms are added to dissipate the odor. The compost is then turned every three days. At the end of 45 days, and when all of the heat of the compost has disappeared, it indicates the material is ready for use. We use the FIFO [first in, first out] system so we harvest the old material first.Why did you decide to add a vermicomposting worm bin to the mix? (That's Mr. Matute below, posing with their worms!)This was a project that the Ministry of Agriculture started. They have always looked up to us and use our garden as a model for the aspiring organic farmers. We took about ¾ of a pound from them about seven months ago. Their total weight is 7 pounds currently! We had lots of paper from our office and would normally send it to the recycle station to be converted to toilet paper. This was another use we thought would benefit the property directly.Elicer Tzib, our head gardener, uses the end product for the nursery only. We noticed a huge change in the seedlings since we started this project. We had better yield from the seeds and the plants look a lot healthier.What were some of the challenges the farmers/composters experienced as they set up and developed the compost piles?The biggest challenge was gaining knowledge. Most of our garden staff farmed at their family farm but in the conventional way. Alternative farming was difficult for them to embrace. Finding them the proper source overcame all of this. Having a leader like Elicer made a huge difference.What are a couple of the biggest yield crops on the farm, and how much do you need to grow to support the kitchen needs?Tomatoes are one and amount varies by season. In peak season we plant anywhere between 125 plants to 150 and our off season is 75 plants. Lettuce is the second largest. We plant about 1 oz. which yields nearly 300 pounds of lettuce for a month use. In the off season, we plant only half of that.Was there a cost savings for Blancaneaux in not sending the various wastes to the landfill?There is no saving really. We do this to show our contribution to Mother Earth. Family farms are very common particularly in the Cayo area, as it has some of the most fertile soil in the country. They range from 10 to 100 plus acres. We hope that by involving our staff, they will take these practices back to their communities, implement better practices at home, and teach others to do the same.--This piece was originally published on The Compostess blog.

As New York City public school students who live in front-line communities that have experienced the ravages of climate change, we believe it is our right to be educated on the science of climate change.When lawmakers in states like Wyoming and Oklahoma try to cast doubt about climate change in their schools' science curricula, climate-change education is a necessity.In a country where big oil and fossil fuel company interests have drowned out the voices of individual citizens, climate change education is a necessity.When 97 percent of the scientific community agrees that climate change is a product of human activities and that it is a significant threat, but only eight out of 278 Republicans in Congress believe the same, climate change education is a necessity.We, students from Global Kids and the Alliance for Climate Education, understand this necessity, and we are taking action. We created a campaign that asks for mandated climate education in all New York City schools in grades K-12. We wrote petitions and gathered thousands of signatures supporting climate education. We participated in the People's Climate March and the UN Climate Summit. We reached out to our elected officials. New York City Council Members Costa Constantinides and Donovan Richards heard our call and introduced New York City Resolution 0375-2014, proposing climate education in New York City schools.This resolution is a step in the right direction -- a step that will prepare young people to be better leaders than the ones we have today. This is merely the beginning.Join us in celebrating this Earth Day by advocating for climate education!--Nsilo Mavour, Global Kids Leader and Alliance for Climate Education Action Fellow"}, {"title": "The Economic Argument Against Keystone XL", "text": "Photo Credit: U.S. Geological SurveyWhatever has happened to the Keystone XL pipeline proposal after the President's veto? Apparently, it is still being reviewed by the State Department and a final decision could come at any time.Last month, Secretary of State, John Kerry gave a speech at The Atlantic Council. In his remarks, he said:It is time, my friends, for people to do real cost accounting. The bottom line is that we can't only factor in the price of immediate energy needs. We have to include the long-term cost of carbon pollution.Good point! Curiously, such analysis is barely present in the State Department's own assessment -- Final Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS). So here is some help.According to the SEIS the construction phase of the project, expected to last a year or two, will contribute $3.4 billion to the U.S. economy. While these numbers are surrounded by controversy, let us take them at face value. Once complete, the pipeline will generate annual tax revenue of $55.6M of direct benefit. Operating the pipeline is going to require about 50 jobs (35 permanent and 15 temporary positions). Using an average salary of oil n' gas pipeline jobs of about $85K per job, we get an additional indirect benefit of $4.25 million annually. (There are other benefits and costs, but in the absence of total cost accounting, we keep our focus on governmental costs and benefits.) So the pipeline yields a one-time benefit of $3.4 billion during construction and recurring annual benefit of $60 million after that.What about the costs? No development costs accrue to the government, but there are environmental costs. According to the SEIS, burning this oil will release between 147-168 million tons of carbon emissions -- what does that cost?Enter the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The SCC was developed by a federal Interagency Working Group (IWG). It is an unfortunate name, because it suggests that these costs are artificial. Perhaps another name like the carbon impact cost \"taxpayers will pony up\" more accurately reflects reality.According to the EPA, the social cost of carbon includes \"the impacts of global warming on agricultural productivity and human health, loss of property and infrastructure to sea level rise and extreme weather events.\" Think rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy, the National Flood Insurance Fund, and various drought relief bills in Congress.The IWG puts the SCC at $43 per ton. (Well, technically it is $38 in 2007 dollars -- sure would be simpler if \"a buck was a buck.\") Other studies have put the carbon cost at $77 a ton or more. A recent study out of Stanford, put the SCC at about $220 a ton -- five times the IWG estimate.  Two notes of caution about this variability. The Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that combine climate and economy, are complex and we are still learning as we go. It would be a mistake to assume the variability makes the cost of carbon illegitimate. That would be the proverbial \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\"Also, all other estimates for the cost of carbon are higher than the IWG's number, suggesting it might be conservative.For our purposes, let us stick with the GAO reviewed number of $43 a ton and the lower end of the emissions estimate of 147 million tons. This puts the annual environmental cost at $6.3 billion dollars. So after construction, the government will reap $60 million in benefits, and have an exposure to a loss upwards of $6 billion annually (over $32 billion, if one used the Stanford estimate). These damages are global -- we could assess the U.S.' share of the $6 billion to be $2 billion, using as proxy, the share of global economic losses per data from Swiss Re.The State Department assessment states:These estimates represent the potential increase in emissions attributable to the proposed Project if one assumed that approval or denial of the proposed Project would directly result in a change in production. However ... such a change is not likely to occur under current market conditions.Their argument contends that the oil is going to be extracted and sold, irrespective of whether the pipeline is built.My friend Mark Hettel described it like someone saying, \"If I had not driven the getaway car, someone else would have. So I am not really an accomplice.\"Just because it is challenging to figure out who is responsible and to what extent, does not mean that we abdicate responsibility. Mark's clever quip may be more insightful than apparent at first. How is proportional culpability determined in a crime?According to Justice Steven Gonzalez of the Washington State Supreme Court:Under Washington criminal law, often, the accomplice is no less liable than the principal. Both are culpable for the crime if each did an act knowing it was in aid of the crime, even if his or her acts alone would not constitute the entire crime.Could this be the guide for how the costs should be allocated? Does this not also make us culpable for global damage?Getting back to the economics... One way of accounting for a potential loss, would be to insure against it. Even if we assume a $2 billion loss (a third of the $6 billion) and a 10 percent insurance premium, our cost of $200 million is over three times the benefit. I am no investment advisor, nor do I play one on TV, but a negative 330 percent return on investment is likely to inspire Jim Cramer to have a coronary.And this assumes one can even buy insurance for something like this. For how long would you be able to buy insurance for your car, if you commit to wrecking it every year?The really insidious issue is an assumption of inevitability. The SEIS deflects to a \"market analysis\" hiding behind the inevitability of the extraction of tar sands oil. But the future is not inevitable; it can be shaped. If we are to stay below the 2°C temperature rise, we have to reverse this sense of inevitability, whether it is in the guise of pragmatism or complacency.To aggressively pursue a low-carbon economy, the Keystone XL pipeline is not just as good a place to start as any, but better. It is an infrastructure project - yesterday's infrastructure.Halted pipeline construction in North Dakota, and wind turbines in the distance highlighting the contrast between yesterday's and tomorrow's infrastructure.

Now She's a Mom With 5 Baby Opossums of Her Own", "text": "WildCare's Wildlife Hospital treats nearly 4,000 ill, injured and orphaned wild animal patients from over 200 species every year. This is one patient's story.Does WildCare REALLY make a difference for orphaned wild babies?This little orphan was a miracle baby last summer -- an opossum pup so tiny at 18 grams as to almost not be viable, and so late in the season we didn't have an opossum companion to keep her company (hence the stuffed animal she clutches in the photo).As she was raised solo, and from such an underdeveloped age, Opossum Foster Care Team members were very gratified when this opossum grew into healthy adulthood. But would she be able to succeed in the wild?Fast forward to last week. A young female opossum with a pouch full of healthy babies arrived at WildCare from West Marin, suffering head trauma, probably from being hit by a car.A routine scan for a microchip elicited a beep... Wait, was it possible we'd seen this female opossum before?When an orphaned baby animal has grown up at WildCare to be released back into the wild, the Foster Care staff and volunteers that raised her can only hope that she'll survive her first dangerous year in the outside world. We have very few tools that allow us any insight into how our orphaned patients do once they're released.However, one tool that sometimes provides invaluable data is the microchip, the same injectable chip that our pets receive at the vet's. Although it is expensive for us to do so, WildCare microchips our mammal patients prior to release. It is very rare that the routine microchip scan (done during every mammal patient intake) indicates the presence of a chip, but when it does, the information gained is beyond price.Imagine Medical Staff's excitement when this female opossum's shoulder elicited a beep!The microchip scanner gave us a number, which we were able to cross-reference in WildCare's extensive patient database. Reading this opossum's patient record, we discovered she was our \"miracle baby\" from the summer before!When we first met her, this opossum pup was so tiny, she was almost not viable, and she arrived so late in the season we didn't have an opossum companion to keep her company. Despite calls to all the other wildlife centers in Northern California, there simply was not another baby opossum to put her with.This young female had several counts against her successful survival in the wild. Even more daunting, fewer than 50 percent of wild baby opossums survive their first year. Was this baby developmentally prepared? Would she be able to find a mate and have a family like other wild opossums? Medical Staff evaluated her over the course of the nearly two months that she was at WildCare, and noted that her instincts developed normally. She also showed no tameness, a risk with a single baby raised alone. WildCare always raises babies with members of their own species, except in extremely unusual circumstances like this one.An opossum baby that arrives at WildCare weighing just 18 grams has a slim chance of surviving her first weeks in care, but this little one fought for every ounce she gained.Opossums are marsupials, and are born smaller than the size of a raisin with no fur, tightly sealed eyes and ears and only vestigial limbs. Neonatal opossum pups use their forelimbs to climb from the birth canal into their mother's pouch, or marsupium, where they latch onto a nipple to continue their development. A baby that becomes dislodged from her mother's pouch while she still lacks fur has a very slim chance for survival indeed.Staff and volunteers in the Wildlife Hospital all remembered this young female because she had arrived so tiny, was a solo baby despite our best efforts to find her a companion, and she had fought so valiantly to survive. All of these factors counted against her ultimate success in the wild, but of course we wanted to give her the chance.But this opossum not only survived her return to her natural habitat, she thrived! Obviously she found food and shelter, had successfully navigated her first winter storms, and she had even found a mate! Although it was very sad to see her back in the Wildlife Hospital, discovering that this opossum had succeeded in the wild to this point provides an excellent data point, and it shows that our Foster Care program for raising orphaned opossums is both effective and successful.This young female had found great success after her release, but unfortunately, as happens to so many opossums in the wild, she had also found a road, and had probably suffered a glancing blow from a car. Her arrival at WildCare was precipitated by several calls from visitors to a campground in Olema about an opossum circling in the open, a clear indicator of head trauma.In the Wildlife Hospital, we frequently see that a mother opossum can suffer a significant injury, or even be killed in an accident, but her body will protect her babies from harm. Our young mother has significant head trauma, and may have some vision problems, but her ability to care for her babies is unimpaired. The whole family will stay at WildCare while the mother heals and the babies grow up.What will that be like? Watch the video below to see another mother opossum, a former patient, navigate her enclosure at WildCare with all her babies clinging to her back!WildCare is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported almost entirely by private donations and individual memberships.

Engage Communities of Color", "text": "By Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Van JonesAs we celebrate Earth Day, it's a good time to remember that pollution and climate change aren't just environmental issues. They're justice issues.Worldwide, people of color shoulder a heavier burden from toxic water, contaminated air, and dwindling natural resources. The same is true in America.For example, African Americans living in Los Angeles are twice as likely to die in a heat wave than other city residents. As a result of climate change, urban heat waves are on the rise and the risk is growing. In cities across the country, poverty and inequality have created a perfect storm that traps black families in neighborhoods with few trees, little shade, and lack of access to air conditioning or cars that allow them to escape when severe weather hits.It's not just the record heat. When disasters strike, no matter where, people with the fewest resources have a harder time preparing, escaping, and recovering. Just look at what happened with Hurricane Katrina or how the BP oil spill dramatically impacted Gulf Coast's Vietnamese-American community. When Superstorm Sandy hit, it wreaked havoc on New York's poor neighborhoods, including causing pervasive respiratory illness among low-income residents whose homes were struck by mold.The pollution that's driving climate change also disproportionately affects communities of color. In fact, 78 percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a toxic-spewing coal plant, which helps explain why one out of six black kids suffers from asthma -- compared with a national average of one in ten.According to Hector Sanchez, chair of the National Latino Coalition on Climate Change, more than 80 percent of Latinos live in counties that violate at least one federal air-pollution law and Latino children are two and half times more likely to develop asthma than non-Latinos.Given that communities of color pay the heaviest toll, it's not surprising that they consistently demonstrate the highest level of support for protecting clean air and fighting climate change. A 2014 Green For All poll showed that 68 percent of minority voters favor immediate action to address climate change. Last month, a Benenson Strategy Group poll showed that a whopping 85 percent of African Americans support global commitments on climate--the largest percentage of any demographic group. Climate change will likely be a major issue for our nation's 17.8 million black voters in the 2016 presidential election.People of color need to play a larger role in the decision-making on climate and clean air. A recent report by the group Green 2.0 shows that \"Despite increasing racial diversity in the United States, the racial composition in environmental organizations and agencies has not broken the 12% to 16% \"green ceiling\" that has been in place for decades.\"We need equal protection from the worst environmental problems. We also need equal access to the best opportunities in the clean energy economy--including jobs in solar, wind, and energy efficiency. These kinds of jobs are growing--and they tend to pay more while requiring less formal education, which is a recipe for escaping poverty.There are millions of black voters who are ready to act on climate; they just need access to the right opportunity. And once they're in the ring, big polluters won't stand a chance. Polluters know this--that's why they have begun a misinformation campaign claiming that clean energy hurts African American families.The path forward is clear--and people of color are already leading the way.In fact, they are largely responsible for one of the country's most cutting-edge--and wildly successful--efforts to slash pollution and poverty: California's cap and trade bill, which makes polluters pay for their climate garbage, and then directs the funds to hard-hit neighborhoods. A coalition of black, Latino, and Asian community groups rallied to advance the legislation in 2012, and it raised $262 million for disadvantaged communities in its first year alone. By 2020, the law will keep a projected 78 million metric tons of carbon pollution out of the air--the equivalent of taking one out of every fifteen cars in America off the road. And it never would have happened without the genius of the state's communities of color.Climate solutions and pollution safeguards are about so much more than protecting the environment. They're about creating work, health and wealth. They're about righting the ship in neighborhoods that have suffered from decades of racism, divestment, oppression and poverty.That's why groups like Green For All and members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) are working to connect more of our folks to the climate policy and clean energy decisions that affect our future. Because the more engaged we are, the better America's solutions to climate change will be.Congresswoman Barbara Lee represents the East Bay and serves on the Budget and Appropriations Committees.

On that day in 1970, 20 million people turned out to demand the protection and restoration of the earth, air, water, forests, natural lands, and species that support, sustain, and enrich every aspect of our lives.In more recent times, Earth Day hasn't had quite the same impact. Let's change that. More important, let's support and defend the earth every day, not just on Earth Day.Here are three simple but meaningful things you can commit to that will help protect the earth for present and future generations:1. Bring your own cups, bottles, and bags. When you picked up your morning coffee, did it come in a disposable cup? Was your bottled water in a plastic bottle? Out shopping, did you take your purchases home in a plastic bag?In addition, dangerous chemicals in plastics, including endocrine disruptors that are a concern in reproduction and human development, leach into the water and liquids the plastics contain, which is harmful to human health.A large proportion of plastic ends up in our waterways--in our streams, rivers and eventually our oceans--where it harms at least 267 species through ingestion or entanglement.So this year, save a life--save many lives, human and animal. Set aside your disposable plastic bags and bottles. Set aside that disposable coffee cup. Protect the environment. When you choose to bring your own cups, bottles, and cloth bags, you are helping to reduce pollution and the harm associated with disposables.2. Switch from disposed-of paper to reusable cloth. Reducing your trash generation at home is another easy daily step with a huge environmental impact. Although recycling is great, actually reducing the amount of waste you generate is even better. One easy and cost-saving place to start is the kitchen.Paper towels and napkins have become the norm for drying hands and cleaning up messes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates we throw away 3.5 million tons of paper towels and tissues in any given year--this equals 7 billion pounds, which works out to be more than 20 pounds of paper towels and tissues per person per year. Paper towels can't be recycled, and they usually come into our homes wrapped in plastic, another enduring and harmful piece of trash. All this waste takes up landfill space. It also comes at a price: loss of trees (for the pulp), use of water (for production), and the generation of greenhouse gases (during production and transport). Also, most are bleached, which further increases their environmental burden.Instead of using paper towels or wipes, reach for a cloth towel. Cloth towels and wipes can be used, rinsed, and used again. Wash them along with the rest of your laundry, and cloth towels and wipes will serve you for many years to come. They can also become lovely kitchen accents. The tea towels I use are decorated with artistic whales, dolphins, and elephants. Whatever pattern I select, my dish-drying and hand-drying towels add texture and color to my home. And when I pull out my blue, yellow, or pink cloth wipes, the effectiveness of my cleanup job for the spilled juice, the dropped pizza, or the drizzled ice cream is much more effective and satisfying.For more reusable fun, consider using colored cloth napkins instead of paper ones, and maybe find some fancy napkin rings so each person can identify his or her napkin for reuse between washings (the actual purpose of napkin rings, which were created during the 19 century).Assuming you use three paper towels a day, even at $10 a pop for hand towels and $5 each for organic-cotton cloth napkins, those cloth equivalents become free in a matter of months. If you keep paper towels around for occasional use, buy recycled paper towels with no bleach and no dyes.3. Shovel the snow and rake the leaves--leave gas-powered engines behind. Gas-powered leaf, lawn, and snow blowers require loud engines that run on polluting fossil fuels. Rakes and shovels require people power. By cutting out the gas, you are avoiding the harms that come with the extraction and burning of fossil fuels and saving yourself and your neighbors from the noise pollution they inflict.Leaf, lawn, and snow blowers emit carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. These small machines have not been subject to the same air-pollution mandates as other industrial operations and so are even bigger contributors to air pollution than you might imagine. The California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board calculates that \"hydrocarbon emissions from one-half hour of leaf blower operation equal about 2,200 miles of driving, at 30 miles per hour average speed.\"The noise that gas-powered leaf blowers generate has led many communities to regulate their use, and a few have even banned them. Human health concerns associated with leaf-blower noise include noise-induced hearing loss; high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease; and anxiety and physiological stress-related effects. Even at a distance, leaf-blower noise often reaches 70 decibels, the maximum safe level set by the U.S. for workplace noise. EPA recommendations for home and nonwork environments are 55 decibels (outdoor) and 45 decibels (indoor); recommended levels for schools and hospitals are even lower.If you have a health issue that limits your physical activity, don't endanger yourself by raking leaves or shoveling snow. But if you're in good health, consider pulling out the rakes and shovels. In addition to saving on gas and cutting down on pollution and noise, you'll get the added value of a little exercise and some time enjoying the out of doors.Taking small steps can have big impacts that protect and enhance our environment and in so doing directly protect our communities, our health, and our safety.Maya K. van Rossum is the Delaware Riverkeeper, and has led the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (DRN) since 1994.

Its authors, an eclectic group, are working with foundational myths: they engage with basic beliefs about the nature of reality and the desires of human being -- the kinds of beliefs typically dealt with in religious and philosophical teachings. That such profound claims cannot be adequately addressed in such a short space soon becomes evident. All the same, given its bold call to action, this document deserves to be read and critiqued with care.There is a fair amount the \"Manifesto\" gets right, so I'm going to mention at least one of these facets, before pointing to three of its major shortcomings. First and foremost, and this is where it is refreshing, the \"Ecomodernist Manifesto\" is a declaration of war on all forms of nostalgia. The past should not be the standard of reference, say the authors. In the past, our lives were shorter and our quality of life lower. No one in their right mind should wish to return to a way of life in which disease was more prominent, nutrition less available, and leisure time more scarce. There is no going back, only forward, they argue, and future prospects for humanity and for the planet depend on our creativity in developing more advanced forms of technology. Right they are, and rest assured, this point of view will surely draw outcries from misty-eyed Heideggerians everywhere. Heidegger, a major influence on a swath of the present day environmental movement, had famously claimed that modern technology was \"challenging\" to the earth, whereas more primitive forms of machinery had been in greater harmony with the flows of nature. The Heideggerian point of view, which remains prominent, deserves to be challenged.However, at least three major points in the document deserve serious critique. The first is a certain level of ethical sloppiness. \"Climate change and other global ecological challenges,\" claim the authors, \"are not the most immediate concerns for the majority of the world's people. Nor should they be.\" Really? This statement deserves more nuance than currently granted to it. There is a tremendous difference between claiming to understand why some of the \"world's people\" might rather have access to consistent energy than be concerned about climate change, versus the normative pronouncement, \"nor should they be.\" The latter is a leap to conclusions. Perhaps they should, and we should too, given that continuing reliance on fossil fuels will significantly alter life on earth as we know it. At the very least there is a significant counterbalance missing here, one which would create a tension between the \"should\" of granting energy resources to those who need them versus the \"should\" of ensuring the stability of the eco-system for the generations to come.The second shortcoming is a blurring of narrative categories. The document, at points, verges into science-fiction. \"Looking forward,\" it claims, \"modern energy may allow the capture of carbon from the atmosphere to reduce the accumulated carbon that drives global warning.\" Even with the perfunctory \"may,\" the statement is misleading. Geo-engineering solutions are far from being a get-out-of-jail-free card. Presenting them as realistic possibility is surely no grounds on the basis of which to make policy now.The third major flaw of the \"Manifesto\" is a lack of regard for historical nuance. Of course, as a genre (think Communist, Futurist, etc.) manifestos typically seek to up-end the status-quo. The ecomodernist authors are no exception. In their drive to move ahead, they mention history in only the most casual of ways, in the context of what they describe as its general trajectory. What is missing is a profound sense of irony, along with a deeper understanding of costs.It's not immediately clear to me why the authors chose the name \"ecomodernist.\" The \"modernist\" part of the title, however, is apt, because modernist thinkers, unlike the relentless uncertainty of post-modern philosophers, were still committed to notions of improvement and progress. What is lacking in the \"Ecomodernist Manifesto\" is a comprehensive acknowledgement of the deep contradictions of Modernity, and the unintended consequences of technological developments. Unintended consequences are mentioned, but only in passing. References to myth are nowhere to be found, and this too should be seen as a serious omission. From the Prometheus of Greek mythology to the Tower of Babel of Biblical fame, our Western heritage is rich with admonitions about the dangers of unchecked technological optimism. Allowing for a degree of humility is not a concession to the politics of nostalgia the manifesto wishes to disavow. Rather, it would be a move inspired by caution, away from the quasi-Utopian tone of the document -- a concession to the tragic and unpredictable facets of life that give daily texture to our existence, no matter the technology we develop.I end with a brief reference to the idea of \"decoupling\" from nature, another major stance for the authors. Here too there is certain degree of naiveté at play. In the Western tradition, the debates over the human relationship with nature became particularly thick during the 16th century, as Latin translations of the pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanical Problems made their way to centers of learning such as Venice, Paris, and Urbino. In those cities, this text contributed to a complex debate over the relative ease or difficulty of using the mechanical arts to protect humans from the forces of nature. Some of the most popular among 16th century engineers including Agostino Ramelli and Guidobaldo del Monte argued then, as do the ecomodernists now, that technology, broadly construed, had served as a barrier to the forces of nature, and had made easy the operations of life. And yet, look where that has gotten us, environment be damned. What some of the 16th century engineers forgot then, and what the authors of the \"Ecomodernist Manifesto\" pay lip service to now, but don't seem to take very seriously, is that humans are inescapably a part of nature. Technology has been, and will continue to be a protective barrier, and yet it is a permeable one, part of a complex and dynamic system. While there will surely be shifts in the balance, ultimately there can be no such thing as \"decoupling.\" Every technological transaction will have a cost, both for humans, and for the rest of nature of which we are a part. Greater awareness of these costs is surely warranted."}, {"title": "Happy Earth Day, Take a Bow!", "text": "As I was sitting over coffee watching the sun peek its nose over the horizon on this 22nd day of April -- the 45th anniversary of Earth Day -- I suddenly realized I wanted to say something to my fellow members of the \"Aging Boomers Club\":  Thank you.  Thank you for Earth Day. Thank you for all it has done for our remarkable planet, for our children and our children's children, and for -- and, I don't know that I have the words to overstate this -- our very future.  And thank you, too, for making today possible.  Oh, don't get me wrong, we wide-eyed, bomb-fearing, TV-addicted, Beatles-worshipping, suburb-loving, post-war Baby Boomers did not invent environmental activism. We only learned it at the knees of rugged, daring, free-thinking individualists like Teddy Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller, Ansel Adams, Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, Jacques Cousteau, John Muir, Rachel Carson, Robert Frost, Joni Mitchell and countless others.   But, make no mistake; environmentalism had never been a movement until we came along. In fact, even though we didn't conceive Earth Day in 1970, it was our generation who made it possible. Many don't know this, but when Senator Gaylord Nelson, one of the lone environmental advocates on Capitol Hill at the time, first came up with the idea of hosting an annual celebration of the Earth, her beauty and bounty of resources, he chose today -- April 22 -- because it worked in the context of that year's school calendars and class schedules.   He knew, you see, that if there was one group of people who, in 1970, were likely to take the notion of a grassroots celebration of Mother Earth and make it not only an event and media-worthy, but a recurring phenomenon, it was us -- America's students, young people and dreamers.  So, while we didn't conceive Earth Day, we certainly brought it to life. And what we've done to instill our love of this planet in the hearts of future generations has been nothing short of remarkable.   You know, I always thought my grandparents had seen so much in their lives. They sailed across the ocean and passed through the gates at Ellis Island without the ability to even speak the language. And in their time, they witnessed such things as the invention of flight, the birth of television and the explosion of the industrial age -- not to mention two world wars and a Great Depression. And I used to think how remarkable their generation had been for having come so far so fast.  But, look at our generation. We've gone from mimeograph to instant messaging, and seen first-hand the utter explosion of personal computing, wireless devices and information tonnage, along with the implosion of traditional media and all the rules that once governed them. We've seen man walk on the moon, and have been forced to learn in real time things that might have left the generation before ours stymied, if not downright paralyzed with fear.   Yet, all those things pale in comparison to how we've completely changed our attitudes toward this planet. After all, we're the generation that grew up with Love Canal, lead-based paint and DDT. We're the kids who were once taught that conspicuous consumption was a true marketplace ideal, and that things like disposable razors, pens and diapers were good things. And we're the generation that had it drilled into our impressionable young minds over and over by Madison Ave. that things like returnable glass bottles were stodgy and archaic, and that throwaway plastic ones would, somehow and in some unexplained way, make us cooler.  Yet, despite all that, look at how far we've come; not only rising above that kind of corrosive thinking, but to loving planet Earth and respecting her bounty and broad appeal. And if you don't think that's so, just pick up a copy of last Sunday's Parade magazine (maybe the very symbol of broad appeal, if not mainstream acceptance) and look at the cover. There you'll see a simple two-word phrase amid the graphic word cloud superimposed there, a celebration of the language of the environmental movement.   That phrase and those two words? \"LEED Buildings.\"  We have indeed come a long way in what seems like a short time, my friends. To all you Gen X and Millennials who, like me, love this earth and feel compelled to protect her against those who would exploit her to their own personal gain, not to mention selfishly put her ability to provide life to future generations in jeopardy, you are to be applauded.  And to all of you Boomers my age who learned the language of environmentalism and harnessed its power -- and did so on the fly -- who lovingly passed on your respect for nature to your sons and daughters, and who, in a very real way, made this remarkable annual celebration possible in the first place, what can I say?  Except, thank you. And Happy Earth Day!"}, {"title": "Every Day Is Earth Day on a Farm", "text": "Today is Earth Day. A day to celebrate this planet we call home. But it's more than just a planet, and it's definitely worthy of more than a single day of celebration.It's a funny world we live in -- this Earth of ours. We remind people one day a year to care for those natural resources around us, and seem to spend the majority of the rest of the year is spent either taking advantage of those resources, or condemning those that are already the most vested in its care.Yes, I am talking about agriculture. Every day -- day in, day out -- farmers around the world think about the Earth. We consider the soil and what it needs; we consider the crops that are growing and what they need; and we consider the water available and how we can protect it.But that's not what we hear about. We hear about giant farms, abuse of the land, abuse of resources -- nothing could be further from the truth.Water quality is a top priority. The water on and around our farms is the water that we use to drink every day, to water our cattle, to nurture our crops. Making sure our water is safe and protected is important to us. The water we have today is the water for our future generations as well.Providing habitat for wildlife comes naturally to farms and ranches. Through improved technology and management practices, such as buffer strips and reducing tillage, we are able to not only provide more habitat, but many farms have seen an increase in wildlife.Soil quality is also a priority. The soil provides our livelihood -- whether it is from growing crops for us to harvest, or growing grass to feed our cattle. We take measures to ensure that the soil does not erode, that soil health is as high as can be, and that we use as few chemicals as possible. The soil we have today is also the soil for our future generations.Farms recycle. Farms repurpose. Farms reuse wherever we can. That's a trait that has been around since the beginning of time. And it's one that we share with Mother Nature.Earth Day is a worthy celebration. It's great to remind people of the blessings we've been given, and the need to preserve what we have been charged to maintain. It is our duty to ensure these gifts are also available for the next generation to enjoy.But, Earth Day should not be limited to one day. It takes a lifetime of commitment to ensure that our resources are protected for our children and grandchildren. And it takes constant reminders to keep us on task, as well as being aware of our surroundings and changes in nature.I can attest that there are few people that are reminded more constantly than farmers and ranchers. There are few people that have the daily interaction and reliance upon a resource that we have so little control over. There are few people that are more in tune to what the soil needs, to what is happening to our water, to what is important for the future.Yes, Earth Day is every day -- especially on a farm.Val and her husband, Mark, farm in rural North Dakota, growing corn, soybeans, wheat and hay as well as raising cattle and four busy boys.

That's the gist of the End Polluter Welfare Act, a bill Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Representative Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) are sponsoring this Earth Day.We clearly need the help. While renewable energy struggles for temporary and comparatively tiny incentives, billions worth of permanent subsidies are gifted every year to the industries driving our climate over the cliff. For years, this has been accepted as the status quo -- and for the sake of our climate, that needs to change.Would you believe that the Department of Energy is still co-signing loans for boondoggle projects that pretend coal can be clean? Or that the Department of Transportation is still handing out grant money to oil train operators, essentially subsidizing the unsafe cars that killed 47 people in Lac Megantic, Canada? Or that Congress is still shoveling billions into the pockets of oil, gas and coal interests, ensuring that these companies remain some of the most under-taxed in our entire economy?The Sanders-Ellison bill would put an end to these giveaways and many others. The End Polluter Welfare Act takes aim at a definitive list of federal subsidies for polluting industries, targeting everything from mega-tax breaks and giveaway leasing to government R&D programs and loan guarantees. At a time when programs that protect people and the environment are being cut to the bone, it would net over $135 billion in savings over the next decade.These are just a couple of the biggest reforms the act covers:This Earth Day, climate policy hangs on a fairly simple question: How do we keep it in the ground? Between two-thirds and four-fifths of the fossil fuel reserves we already know about can never be burned. There's a lively debate on the best way to do this, from executive orders banning extraction to carbon taxation and divestment, and some combination of these solutions is probably the path forward.But one of the easiest first steps? Stanching the flow of subsidies to the industries driving the crisis. Forcing polluters to pay their fair share raises revenue for much-needed social programs, protects our air and water, and makes the cost of burning carbon a little closer to the true costs of the damage it inflicts. Keeping dirty energy in the ground means keeping polluters off of corporate welfare."}, {"title": "New York Man Plans To Swim Through Extremely Polluted Gowanus Canal On Earth Day", "text": "A New York man is taking a unique approach to clean water advocacy this Earth Day.Donning a drysuit and exposure protection gear on Wednesday, water advocate and swimmer Christopher Swain is planning to swim the entire 1.8-mile length of New York City's Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn.

For some, the answer seems to be that it proves the value of e-cigarettes.The reason most often cited is the concurrent drop in traditional cigarette use among teens: cigarette smoking dropped 25 percent, and use of cigars and pipes fell too. Across all ages, traditional smoking has decreased nationally from 21 percent in 2005 to 17 percent last year, an unprecedented drop. As the American Psychology Association puts it:\"e-cigarettes hold a lot of promise as a new way to help smokers quit or reduce conventional smoking.\"A one-time smoker who only reluctantly quit some 30 years ago, I relished the idea of a smoke with far fewer health risks to myself and those around me. After seeing lots of advertising for market leader Blu from its UK parent Imperial Tobacco, I finally bought a disposable Blu e-cigarette to try.The big surprise was how heavy it was. I had trouble holding it as gracefully as I did traditional cigarettes back in the day. With great effort, I extracted a puff, coughed, and suffered from a sore throat for some time after. I put it aside, and when a month later decided to give it another try, I discovered it seemed to have run out of steam. So I threw it away.But not without a pang. It felt too substantial to throw in household garbage, more like an electronic device than a cigarette. What harm was it doing? And could that harm be worse than throwing away a traditional cigarette?Surely not. The seemingly indestructible (and ubiquitous) cigarette filters create ghastly litter. By some estimates, cigarette butts account for 38% of litter items worldwide and up to 21% of coastal waste. Most filters are made of the plastic cellulose acetate that takes up to 10 years to degrade.But e-cigarettes could be an even dicier proposition, environmentally speaking.First, let's dispel the myth that refillable e-cigarettes are never thrown away, as e-cigarette marketers would have us believe. The life of an e-cigarette, whether disposable or refillable, is measured in weeks according to vendors.What environmental harm do they do? Few studies exist, but an anonymous contributor to the web site Totally Wicked Eliquid suggests that unless all e-smokers recycle the various parts of their smoker, the environmental damage could be far worse and longer lasting than cigarette's paper and filters. In his words:\"The wadding inside the cartridges is essentially the same as in regular cigarettes, plus the housing is metal (stainless steel) or plastic instead of paper. Then we have to add in the metal parts of dead rechargeable batteries and the metal atomizers, and we see the refuse/recyclable pile grow larger along with longer possible degradation time.\"And there is no easy way to recycle e-cigarettes. The UK site Tobacco Control reported that\"none of the (e-cigarette) products provided disposal instructions for spent cartridges containing nicotine.\"Certainly the Blu I bought had no easily discernible disposal instructions.At the same time, there are toxic heavy metals in the cartridge, chips and circuits of most e-cigarettes. A study from USC Biterbi noted that\"e-cigarettes emitted higher levels (than traditional cigarettes) of...nickel, zinc, and silver.\"Another environmental concern -- one that the CDC considers pre-eminent -- is that many discarded e-cigarettes are not fully used and still contain nicotine liquid, which pollutes the ground and water around disposal areas. Nicotine is a poison whose effects go from vomiting to seizures to death.The human dangers have been well-documented. E-cigarettes tend to explode due to overheating batteries. The New York Times cited \"soaring\" accidental nicotine poisonings, notably among children attracted to the product's bright colors and sweet flavors. Nicotine itself is not only addictive but, as reported in Scientific American, is also linked to an impaired immune system. E-cigarette vapors contain several cancer-causing substances, as well as particles of tin, chromium, nickel and other heavy metals. Secondhand e-cigarette aerosol contains at least 10 chemicals identified as carcinogens and reproductive toxins.These health dangers are made worse by lack of inspections and unmonitored suppliers from China. Isn't that just the price you pay when indulging in nicotine, a drug I too once delighted in? But it's a different story when that indulgence affects the rest of us too.Photo courtesy via Vaping360.com."}, {"title": "Make Earth Day Count", "text": "On its special day, what do you give the planet that has everything?

Last month, the International Energy Agency announced that \"global emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector stalled in 2014, marking the first time in 40 years in which there was a halt or reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas that was not tied to an economic downturn.\"The next time someone tries to tell you that we can't really do anything about climate disruption, you can inform them that we already are. We (and by \"we,\" I mean people all over the planet) are replacing fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy at a record pace. Ever since 2013, the planet has been adding more renewable energy than any other kind, and this good news about global emissions is a result. If we keep it up, this can be the turning point in limiting global warming and climate disruption.But although emissions may have been flat for the planet last year, here in the U.S. they have risen slightly in the past two years. Fortunately, they're still below our national peak in 2007. That definitely would not be the case were it not for the incredible progress we've made in retiring polluting coal-fired power plants and, at the same time, adding new renewable energy. As President Obama pointed out in his weekly address last weekend, the U.S.currently installs as much solar energy every three weeks as it did in all of 2008. We also added four times as much wind energy last year as we did in 2013.The question, then, is how do we not only maintain this momentum but also build on it? And this time, when I say \"we,\" I'm talking about each of us individually -- not just a bunch of \"decision makers\" somewhere. Simple: We must join our voices and combine our strength. Which, after all, is the whole purpose of a volunteer-driven group like the Sierra Club.

If there must be change, if the consequences have become so dire, how do we confront the vested determination, the systematic entropy, the judicial compromise and political capture of the systems for change? How do we do this? And how do we do this in time?Again and again, the argument comes down to ownership and control of natural resources as private property, to the role of government to uphold the fundamental principles, interests, and protections of the governed, to the paralysis resulting from such ideological conflict, determination, and inflexibility, and to the ability of the public to rectify a condition that has become manifestly evident, illogical, and detrimental to the collective interest, and even suicidal, given the critical exhaustion and inequality that we know ourselves and see around us.It is as simple, and as dreadfully complicated, as that.The evidence becomes clear in the rapidly growing disparity between rich and poor, north and south, developed and emerging nations. On the one hand, we see enormous wealth concentrated in closed control by totalitarian states, oligarchs and corporations, individual fortunes capable of enormous political influence, corrupt financial schemes and practice, and the most luxurious quality of life for a few, while on the other hand, we see increasing global poverty, declining health and education, economic disruption, physical dislocation, political disenfranchisement, and the most egregiously failed quality of life for so many.Who are we? What does it say about us as individuals, communities, and nations that we would allow such tyranny to stand? If water is both symbol and reality of this predicament, does that mean that we will keep whatever remains for ourselves, fight over it even to the death, deprive others of it even if it means thousands more will die by its lack and our indifference? Is that how we want to live? And if or when the collapse of our water system affects us in such a way, is that how we want ourselves, or our children, or our communities to die?This condition cannot, will not, must not stand. In our recent posts focusing on Nature's Trust, we have argued that natural resources are ours to own and to control, and that we have in the public trust document the legal foundation by which to take them back and change how they are used for the benefit of all mankind. We have argued that their value and distribution is a basic human right. We have thereby a strategy grounded in law, a fundamental principle and tool for natural resource sustainability that we have allowed to be eroded by multiple exceptions to the rule. The corporate permitted and licensees, and the governmental agencies we created to regulate and control them, have failed us, and we have lost the knowledge of our rights, even as we have lost the value of those resources to unsustainable, irresponsible consumption.In Nature's Trust and the Public Trust Doctrine, Professor Mary Christina Wood provides us a strategy by which to take back those rights: \"First, it provides tangible legal principles to guide local decision makers in environmental management and sustainable resource use. The fiduciary standards of protection, no waste, and maximization of societal value...can offer beacons of duty for recognized decision making. Second, trust principles provide legal levers by which local communities may assert ecological rights against federal and state environmental agencies...Finally, third, Nature's Trust provides a framework by which local trustees can assess and quantify their global obligations to planetary assets...\"We have three courses from which to choose: 1) we can do nothing, and accept the consequences; 2) we can engage, as so many are today, in violent revolution to protect ourselves and deprive of others of what is left; or 3) we can resolve to use the legitimate tools of law, civil engagement and disobedience, and the force of invention to combat and to change what appears presently destined to destroy us.We have turned to Nature for support and healing and improvement of our lot since the beginning of time. Why would we not trust Nature now?"}, {"title": "Don't Forget the Ocean This Earth Day", "text": "On April 22, 1970, the environmental movement was born when as many as 20 million Americans took to the streets to put the health of the planet front and center on the nation's political agenda. Inspired by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), outraged by the devastation caused by the Santa Barbara oil spill (1969) and modeled on the anti-war movement against U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D.-Wis.) came up with the idea of Earth Day.From the beginning, Earth Day was a bi-partisan effort, as Senator Nelson enlisted Rep. Pete McCloskey (R.-CA) as his co-chair. That first Earth Day led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the passage of the Clear Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. Furthermore, Earth Day served to bring together under one tent the organizations already battling particular concerns -- like industrial pollution, pesticides and toxic dumps, loss of wilderness and extinction of wildlife species -- and led to the creation of many more organizations, including, in 1972, the organization I serve, Ocean Conservancy.We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the vision and commitment of Sen. Nelson, Rep. McCloskey and the individuals and organizations that have continued to advance the environmental agenda through 44 years. Not only has Earth Day and what it stands for become mainstream in the United States, but for its twentieth anniversary in 1990, Earth Day celebrations burst forth on the global stage with participation of over 200 million people in 141 countries, leading to the first United Nations Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. It's estimated that 1 billion people around the globe will participate this year.But even with the great momentum that began with that first Earth Day celebration, one particular concern remains with me. When viewing a photo of Earth from outer space, one is struck by the abundance of waters linking one continent to another. Our ocean covers over 70 percent of the planet's surface, yet mention of the ocean is almost nonexistent in conjunction with Earth Day. If the ocean covers more than two-thirds of the planet, shouldn't it at the very least have \"equal billing?\"This year's Earth Day celebration on Washington, D.C.'s National Mall calls for action on the part of governments, individuals and businesses around the world to end extreme poverty and to address climate change. We at Ocean Conservancy applaud this effort. Each of us can -- and should -- take meaningful action to help protect the ocean waters that have been severely degraded by climate change, overfishing and pollution.A recent article in the journal Science points out that the ocean is being fouled by trash, particularly products and packaging made of plastics, and much of marine life is compromised by the pollution that ensues. Left unchecked, between five to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic will continue to enter the ocean each year, and by 2025, there could be one ton of plastic in the ocean for every three tons of fish.The situation is dire, but it is not without hope. We can solve this problem. Ocean Conservancy is working with a diverse group of stakeholders, including scientists, individuals, corporations and other NGOs to reverse the tide of dangerous and unnecessary debris entering the ocean. We call on every individual to develop an ethic of responsibility regarding the purchase and use of disposable consumer goods. We call on companies producing goods and materials, especially those that manufacture or produce plastics, to work with us to ensure their products do not end up in the ocean. And we call on governments the world over to establish effective waste collection and management systems that will help not only to stop the flow of plastics and other trash into the ocean but can also reduce flooding and health and sanitation problems associated with unmanaged waste.With this type of global action from the planet's individual, business and governmental citizenry, the ocean will be healthier and the entire Earth and its inhabitants, humans and wildlife, will benefit. On this Earth Day, let's remember that two-thirds of the planet is ocean, and that we depend on it for our food, livelihoods, recreation, culture and way of life. By doing our part to help the ocean, we help the planet -- and each other."}, {"title": "Happy Earth Day! And Happy #EarthGratitude Wave!", "text": "Since 1970, Earth has had one special day a year when we take a moment and really think about our planet -- through demonstrations, fundraisers, volunteering, river cleanups, and other means of generally bringing our environment front and center.It was Gaylord Nelson, a senator from Wisconsin, who came up with the idea of creating a \"national teach-in on the environment\" and, with a team led by environmental activist Denis Hayes, built the momentum so that on that first Earth Day, 20 million Americans took to the streets to peacefully demonstrate, protest, and call attention to our environmental problems.In many ways, we've made progress since then. In even more ways, our environmental woes have grown worse. But one thing hasn't changed: Without Earth, none of us would be here; none of us could survive.That's why I wanted to make an addition to the tradition of Earth Day and create the #EarthGratitude Wave. In the way Thanksgiving in America celebrates our connection to each other, I wanted there to be a global moment -- like a wave across the planet -- that celebrates our connection to and dependence on the earth.No need to take to the streets. No need to protest or make a poster. The only thing you need to do today to participate is to say thank you. And if you share that thank you on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter with the hashtag #EarthGratitude, that'll be even better. But it's OK if you just say it to yourself. After all, we know the power of gratitude is infinite, even though our own time on Earth is finite.We all have an opportunity to leave the earth better off, which starts with the intention to do so, and that starts with appreciating what we have.Here are 10 things not a single one of us (no matter our political beliefs, religion, or nationality) could live without that come from the earth:1. Oxygen: Much of the oxygen we breathe is produced by trees. So actually, we also need...2. Trees: Because they create air for us to breathe. And shade. Shade is nice.3. Water: Without water, we would be dry, brittle bones and dust, and the earth would be a desert.4. Soil: Without healthy soil, we couldn't grow food.5. Food: Without food, we would all starve.6. Fuel: Fuel is complicated--be it oil, coal, wood, dung, peat, sun--without it, we would be cold (unless we all moved nearer to the equator), we couldn't cook our food, and we would be limited in our travels. Fuel is good. Fuel comes from the earth (except for what comes from the sun, for which I am also very, very, very grateful).7. Rocks/wood/mud/stones for shelter: We could all go back to living in caves, but it would be tight quarters and we might not all get along. Oh, wait; even with our own homes, we don't all get along! Well, at least we stay dry in a storm.8. Fiber: Whether it's cotton, leather, polyester, or spandex (which come from earthly sources, too) we would be walking around naked and cold, and there would be no shopping or fashion business.9. Paper: While paper has recently been under attack by the tech business, there's still nothing better for sharing knowledge. Without the education that paper brings into our lives, we would have much bigger problems than what to eat. History \"officially\" began when we started writing things down. So paper's what helps keep each generation from having to start from scratch. Think about it, 1,000 years from now, an iPhone and all the data on it might be completely useless to an archeologist. However, a simple handwritten journal (if well preserved) can tell the story and solve the mysteries of our time.10. Pleasures: Let's face it, many (not all!) of life's greatest pleasures come from Earth: chocolate, oysters, coffee, your favorite alcoholic drink, cashmere, sugar and spice, and lots of things nice. Without many of our simple pleasures, life would be considerably less interesting. Let's not take a single thing for granted! Even our own stubborn brains and our ability to think, argue, create, and dream...and our tender hearts, which all crave love...all are dependent on the earth.So, thank you, Earth! I am grateful for all of it! #Earthgratitude!For more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com"}, {"title": "This Earth Day, Ditch the Microbeads for Wildlife's Sake", "text": "After a long day at work, what better way to wash away the stress than a nice, refreshing facial scrub before going to bed? A few years ago, major cosmetics and hygiene product manufacturers devised a way to make this daily ritual even more refreshing: adding tiny plastic microbeads to facial wash that would increase abrasion and, of course, exfoliation.These microbeads proved to be popular with the consumer public and soon found their way into hand soap and even toothpaste. Microbeads appeared to be the key to a well-exfoliated and more invigorating future.Microbeads, the tiny plastics found in beauty products and toothpaste, harm the environment. (Photo by Chip Weiskotten, ©WCS)Unfortunately, those tiny colorful microbeads in your hand soap, facial cleanser and toothpaste are causing major damage to our natural ecosystems and the wildlife that inhabit them.The problem stems from their small size and the enduring nature of polyethylene or polypropylene plastics. Microbeads are designed to be rinsed down the drain along with the soap suds after use, but our municipal water treatment facilities are not equipped to filter such small pollutants out of the water. Thus, after serving their exfoliating purpose, the microbeads flow unimpeded into our streams, lakes and rivers.This sounds like a minor issue, but because plastics biodegrade so slowly, the microbeads remain in those waters virtually forever. And the chemicals contained in the plastic are proving harmful to marine life.Once these pollutants are out in the environment, they make their way into the food chain. To fish and other aquatic creatures, the plastic particles look alluringly like food morsels. Because the microbeads contain chemicals from manufacturing as well as \"hydrophobic pollutants\" from the water that collect on its surfaces, including DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), they are highly toxic to living organisms.The chemicals in those plastics remain in the small fish and amphibians until they are eaten by a larger animal, transferring the pollutants to their new host. In the end, humans may even end up ingesting these particles and associated toxins.Research shows that the tiny particles are creating a big problem. A study from the University of Wisconsin (Superior) found that the Great Lakes contain up to 1.7 million plastic particles per square mile. A report released by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that microbeads were found in the outflow of 25 of 34 wastewater treatment plants studied.Fish sometimes eat microbeads. The chemicals in those plastics could be passed on to humans, according to scientists. (Photo by Julie Larsen Maher, ©WCS)In response to the findings in the Great Lakes, the state of Illinois was the first to ban the sale of cosmetics containing microbeads in 2014. This year, New Jersey followed suit and similar efforts are underway in New York, California and Ohio. Congressman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) has also introduced a bill in Congress to ban the manufacture and sale of products that include microbeads nationally.But we can move this process along by simply choosing to go without microbeads. This Earth Day, you can do your part by trading in your microbead-filled soaps and toothpaste and making sure to buy personal care products that are healthy for both people and wildlife. It's an easy way to make a difference.The personal care product industry has at least recognized the issue. Companies including L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble have signaled that they will move away from microbeads in their products.In the end, the ultimate demise of microbeads should not affect the exfoliation of America too much. There are natural alternatives to plastic that use ingredients like oatmeal to increase abrasion. This is a problem that should be easy to solve. And when we are able to wash our faces before bed without endangering wildlife, it will feel all the more refreshing."}, {"title": "Drought-Resistant? The Future of the California Denim Industry", "text": "There are several troubling new realities emerging from the California drought crisis: We could soon be living in a world where Cinco de Mayo is celebrated without guacamole, where we have to substitute a generic Chilean White for our favorite Napa Valley Chardonnay and where a pack of trail mix will cost $18. Even celebrities will soon be forced to grapple with the horror of choosing between their 'passion for saving the environment' and their pristine manicured lawns.These are dark and dusty times in California. The most serious drought since climate change brought an end to the Mayan Empire 1,200 years ago has left the Golden State's economy - and a large piece our nation's food supply - in jeopardy. As the state searches for answers, could an industry that has long been one of the biggest consumers of water actually become part of the solution?Blue jeans are as California as D-list celebrities and billion dollar start-ups. First introduced to the world during the California gold rush by Levi Strauss in San Francisco, blue jeans became a symbol of Westward expansion, manifest destiny and pure Americana.150 years later, jeans are not only the world's uniform, they also have the potential to once again be a symbol of the cutting edge, this time in saving the environment. Currently jeans (and the larger fashion industry), are a large burden on the precious California water reserves. But recent eco-friendly breakthroughs suggest that should the industry commit itself to new technologies, that jeans could not only be part of the solution to the current drought but could save the California denim industry in the process.For most Californians, especially those angered by Governor Brown's move to exempt farmers from mandatory water shortages, the thought that jeans, or any fashion, could be a solution to their current misery is laughable.After all, it takes around 1,800 gallons of water to grow cotton for a pair of jeans and an additional 800 gallons to wash and ready them. When you consider the fact that California is unexpectedly the nation's second largest cotton producer, that's a lot of water. A conservative estimate suggests that California's denim industry consumes 26 billion gallons per year.How can a product reliant upon a cotton textile that consumes 1/1000th of all the water in California be part of the solution?Welcome to the future. A decade ago, Blue Creations, a denim manufacturer in Carson began incorporating a new water-saving 'ozone washing' technology into their production cycle. A few years later, Levi's introduced their Waterless Denim Jeans using that same Ozone washing. During the production process, the typical jean goes through an average of 3 - 10 spin cycles in washers and dryers. To slash water use, both companies incorporated the multi-wash cycle into a single process. From there, it used this ozone processing to further reduce its water footprint by air blasting its jeans instead of washing them. The result? An average water reduction of 28% (up to 96% in some styles). After it was shown that the quality of the jeans was unchanged, the technology quickly caught on as other major denim brands such as AG Jeans realized its potential.But reducing water usage by 28% was only the start. Understanding that a water shortage could prove ruinous to the industry and that cotton was the predominant thirsty culprit, Levi's and others began working on jeans made from plastic water bottles. Today several jeans companies have replaced traditional cotton with this new recycled material (known as PET). Launched in 2013, Levi's recycled 3.5 million water bottles in its first collection amounting to half a million pairs of jeans sold. Each year since, Levi's has expanded the line and says the jeans have saved a billion gallons of water.Other retailers have taken notice as well. Nike has jumped aboard becoming a leading proponent of recycled materials in athletic wear. Singer Pharrell co-founded Bionic Yarn, a company that produces, tees, sweatshirts, bags and other products from PET plastic bottles instead of cotton. EcoAlf too makes their high tech performance outerwear from PET, coffee grinds and recycled fishing net.Of course, this is just a start. While Levi's plans to have 80% of their brand products made using the Water Less process by 2020 (up from about 25% currently), PET jeans represent a minuscule fraction of denim sales and manufacturing in the U.S. But if California's water supply lasts them long enough to make the change, the decision to shift away from cotton to eco-friendly materials might save California from itself. With less than a few years of water remaining, denim companies with have to act fast.Where would California be without its jeans? Unless the denim industry commits in full to these breakthrough technologies, that's a question that Californians and the 200,000 employed by the industry, may soon be forced to grapple with."}, {"title": "This Earth Day, Let's Celebrate the Role of Zoos and Aquariums in Conservation", "text": "Earth Day is a moment to reflect upon global efforts to protect our planet and its species from a variety of threats. For many of us, this work is taking place right in our own communities -- at the zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens that are a part of many of our lives.When we celebrate those who contribute to conservation, many times zoological parks are not a part of that discussion. In fact, these parks contribute to that effort robustly in land and seascapes across the globe through in-park conservation education, scientific field work, and breeding of species endangered in the wild.Ten juvenile Cuban crocodiles from Sweden's Skansen Aquarium will help sustain a population reduced to a mere 3,000 animals in the wild (only 10 percent of which are breeding females) due to illegal poaching, habitat loss, and hybridization with American crocodiles. (Photo by Natalia Rossi, ©WCS)On Monday, April 20, 10 Cuban crocodiles (Crocodylus rhombifer) were sent to Cuba by Sweden's Skansen Aquarium. The crocs have a storied past that began with a Cold War gift of two Cuban crocs -- a male and a female -- from Fidel Castro to Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Shatalov. The cosmonaut donated the animals to the Swedish aquarium, where they became part of a beloved exhibit and later a breeding program for this critically endangered species.The crocodiles were sent by the Skansen Aquarium to contribute additional genetic diversity to Cuba's endemic Cuban crocodile population -- reduced to a mere 3,000 animals in the wild (only 10 percent of which are breeding females) due to illegal poaching, habitat loss, and hybridization with American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) on the island.This effort reflects a much broader range of conservation actions originating in zoos and aquariums around the globe. The Lincoln Park Zoo's Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes is monitoring chimps in the Congo's Goualougo Triangle. Through its Conservation Fund, Zoo Boise is building a replica of the Gorongosa National Park to highlight the fantastic biodiversity of that protected area in central Mozambique.California's San Diego Zoo has played a leading role in the recovery of wild California condors. Elsewhere in the state, the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter Program has been studying the threatened southern sea otter since 1984 with the aim of understanding threats to the population and promoting its recovery.Projects based at WCS's Bronx Zoo have led in recent years to reintroductions of a variety of threatened species to the wild, including bog turtles and hellbenders (above), a large river-dwelling salamander species. (Photo by Julie Larsen Maher, ©WCS)Projects based at WCS's Bronx Zoo have led in recent years to reintroductions of a variety of threatened species to the wild -- from bog turtles and hellbenders (a large river-dwelling salamander species) to Puerto Rican crested toads and Kihansi spray toads -- the latter previously extinct in its native habitat in Tanzania's Kihansi Gorge.Through our nearly 12 decades, our zoos and aquariums have contributed millions of dollars in support of field conservation, including $12 million raised at the Bronx Zoo Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit that has gone directly to supporting field programs in Africa. In addition, we estimate that 400 million people have visited our zoos and aquarium; for many of them, it will be the only time they have an opportunity to connect with wildlife.Indeed, as I write on Earth Day, Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) institutions are managing more than 3,000 conservation projects distributed across 127 countries. Every one of them is starting to make a difference. Some 124 AZA members have become partners on WCS's 96 Elephants campaign to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand for elephant ivory.Some 124 AZA members have become partners in WCS's 96 Elephants campaign to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand for elephant ivory. (Photo by Julie Larsen Maher, ©WCS)Together, the zoo community is investing $160 million a year in field conservation. That makes the AZA one of the largest supporters of field conservation on the planet. With 185 million visitors worldwide, AZA institutions -- including all of the above-mentioned organizations -- are in a unique position to connect people to field conservation around the globe.Earth Day is a perfect time to visit your local zoo or aquarium. Many of the iconic species attracting the largest crowds, from tigers and elephants to gorillas and tortoises (and many of those that are lesser-known), may be struggling to maintain their existence in the wild. But it is a fair guess that the dedicated staff at your local park is working at home and in the field to protect these and other species that desperately need our support.Cristián Samper is President and CEO of WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society).

However, if we take step back, we can see that small, yet significant, actions are taking place around the world. Silent actions are transforming our way of life, and when placed together like pieces of a puzzle, demonstrate to us that we are, in fact, experiencing a paradigm shift.We see a shift from a narrowly focused definition of development to sustainable development and from the bottom line to the triple bottom line. It isn't just nonprofit organizations taking on environmental and social issues, we are seeing collaboration across disciplines and across stakeholder groups that leverage expertise and resources. The availability of data and an elevated demand for transparency is refining systems already in place, and new IT platforms and financing mechanisms are facilitating opportunities to innovate. This is an exciting time to look around and take note. Here are some examples of how we are beginning to think and do things a bit differently:New UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).As the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) are set to expire in 2015, countries agreed in 2012 on developing a set of succeeding goals for the world that would focus on sustainable development. The SDGs are different than their preceding MDGs, as they include various specific environmental goals, in addition to goals to reducing poverty and inequality. These goals include \"ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns,\" \"taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,\" \"conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\" and \"protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.\"Societal climate demands and government responses.Dutch citizens are taking their government to court on climate change inaction, and Chinese citizens are shining the light on air pollution through individual initiatives like the \"Under the Dome\" documentary, while President Obama is now making climate change action his legacy. Although international negotiations have lagged, regional and bilateral agreements (including one between China and the U.S., the two largest emitters) are happening and provide momentum for talks in Paris at the end of the year. More countries are launching national level climate policies including those that utilize the power of the markets, specifically cap-and-trade systems or carbon tax. Society is asking for change and government responses are evolving in a way that would have been hard to believe just a decade ago (for instance, the U.S. was one of the only countries that didn't ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol).Mainstreaming of the sharing economy.The way that people interact with each other and utilize resources are both changing. Shared housing (Airbnb), cars (Zipcar, Lyft, Uber) and workspaces (Impact HUB, WeWork) are just some of the relatively new initiatives supporting a sharing economy. These initiatives aren't confined to developed countries; Airbnb has listings in 190 countries, including Cuba, Nepal and Myanmar. IDDRI, a think tank, produced a great study that puts some numbers to the environmental benefits of the sharing economy in France. The sharing economy has already redefined the possibilities of how people can work together in win-win scenarios and use resources more efficiently.Alternative definitions of progress and profit.The gross domestic product (GDP), which measures economic productivity, has come to be equated with overall economic well-being, although the indicator fails to incorporate the dependence of the economy on human capital and natural resources. The Social Progress Index (SPI) is an alternative to GDP that uses a smart, holistic approach to measure a country's well-being. It takes into account other variables besides production and consumption such as ecosystem viability, personal rights and water/sanitation. Business practices are also transforming: B Corporations provide a framework for individual companies to think long-term by factoring in social and environmental considerations into the way they do business.Slimming of the gender gap in science class performance.A recent OECD report on gender equality in education has illustrated that throughout the OECD countries, school-aged girls are performing as well as boys in science classes. Also, according to the National Girls Collaborative Project, girls in the U.S. are taking high level math and science courses at similar rates as boys in K-12 education; the percentage of girls taking precalculus, algebra II and advanced biology is actually higher than the percentage of boys taking these courses. Although a gender gap in higher education and professions still exists in STEM fields, the fact that school-aged girls are participating and performing well in these classes demonstrates a shift towards closing the gap.Going local and sustainable (with certification systems to help).Farmer's markets, farm-to-table and slow/local food movements are on the rise like never before. And for good reason -- how cool is it to meet the people that grow your vegetables and see on a restaurant menu where your meat or eggs are from? \"Organic,\" \"Fair Trade Certified,\" \"Free Range,\" \"Cage Free,\" are all labels that help people make informed decisions. Unfortunately, we do still live in a world where these options aren't universally accessible, and where eating healthier, locally or from companies with elevated social and environmental standards can be more expensive. But, as more weight is put on such standards and consumers choose to support these options, prices will most likely go down.Millennial values.Surveys and studies show that Millennials want something different in life than previous generations. Their job, consumerism and lifestyle expectations reflect that they support companies and leaders that hold values similar to their own, i.e., social and economic equality, environmental sustainability and accountability. Millennials in the emerging markets of China, Russia, India and Brazil, where they make up a large percent of the population, feel responsible for \"leaving the world in better shape for future generations\" and a majority of these Millennials also felt that \"there's a need to balance out the inequalities of the world\", according to a survey by JWTIntelligence. In another survey, Millennials around the world prioritized \"spending time with family\" and \"living a long and healthy life\" over \"being wealthy.\"All about the start-ups.Small, flexible companies with big ideas continue to emerge and are quickly moving from the idea-stage to the market. With a focus on mobility, cost and the ability to leverage open-source resources and data, old problems are being approached in new ways. Hackathons bring people with tech skills together to take on challenging projects, while venture capital companies and accelerators, such as Clean Tech Open, are there for support. Tech startups aren't limited to Silicon Valley either; the power of IT is being harnessed to propel sustainability all around the world, including African startups that provide off-grid power to rural areas and prevent blackouts, Chilean allGreenup, that created an app to track and reward prizes for individual activities to promote sustainability, and Israeli start-ups that are driving clean energy and energy independence.Instead of resorting to a cynical stance towards Earth Day this year, look around to see the movement that is sneaking up on us and transitioning not only our attitudes, but also our global economy, towards a more holistic system."}, {"title": "The Second Coming of Solar", "text": "For nearly half a century, homeowners and utilities have mounted solar panels on rooftops and in massive generation projects in the desert. Much of that was only made economical because of tax breaks and subsidies, such as California's Solar Initiative (the \"CSI\" or Million Solar Roof Initiative, as it is often called) and the federal Investment Tax Credit, which paid for as much as 50 percent of the costs. But solar is no longer a charity case, having grown up to outcompete conventional energy generation in many ways -- which means there is a second wave of sun-powered opportunities coming that smart investors will want to ride.Not only has the cost of solar panels dropped from $150/watt in 1970 to 60 cents/watt today, but the industry that was jumpstarted by the early incentive programs also resulted in a dramatic drop in the \"balance of system\" costs (design, installation, electrical connections, etc). The installed cost of solar in 2007, when the CSI began, was nearly $10/watt of generating capacity. Today it's down to just over $5/watt for residential and about $4/watt for utility scale projects.Expressed another way, the average cost in the U.S. of generating energy from the sun is about $130 per megawatt hour compared to coal fired generation at $147 and conventional natural gas generation at $128. Solar, installed where the energy is used, is also more efficient than large centralized generation where electrons must travel many miles over transmission lines, losing over 6 percent of the energy along the way, meaning the effect of every megawatt of solar is greater to the nation's energy supply than conventional systems.Since 2007, Californians installed nearly 2,000 megawatts of solar, equal to two nuclear power plants (which turned out to be a very good thing for the state's energy grid when leaks in the San Onofre nuclear power plant forced it to shut down in 2013), creating jobs even in the recent recession. For example, in 2007 OCR Roofing in Sacramento, California employed over 100 people in traditional roofing jobs. The recession hit OCR and the entire housing industry hard, but instead of laying off workers as others did, OCR trained its staff to install solar on rooftops and actually grew the business, so that in 2009, Peterson Dean bought the company and became the largest privately owned solar and roofing company in the nation. Today, in California alone, there are over 1800 businesses serving various parts of the solar supply chain employing over 50,000 workers, clearly a rapidly growing industry.But perhaps the biggest trend that points to a second wave for solar is the way that projects are financed. For decades, a homeowner faced an upfront cost of $20,000 or more and a payback from savings on energy bills of a decade. Solar City and companies like it have changed that model to be more like buying a car. You can still pay for the whole thing at once, but now you can lease the system and pay as you go instead, locking in a fixed rate for your energy over time that is far lower than normal utility rates.Some Solar City customers are adding battery backup systems that keeps a home or business operating during blackouts and will one day allow them to drop off the grid altogether. In places with time variant pricing, batteries can store cheap grid energy at night and dispatch it back to the utility during the day at a profit, while keeping the lights and air conditioner running on the solar power coming from the rooftop.Which brings me to another driver for solar 2.0 -- rising electricity rates. The drought in the western U.S. means fewer kilowatts generated by our once mighty hydroelectric dams and reservoirs. To make up the difference, utilities build fossil-fueled \"peaker\" plants that are more expensive to operate because they're only used when demand is highest (imagine if you owned a car, but had to buy another one to drive only when the weather was hot!). Nor are these trends limited to North America. The drought in Brazil is impacting their hydropower too and, coupled with new net metering laws (allowing the sale of excess solar energy to the local utility) their nascent solar industry is poised for rapid California-style growth.Wind, biomass, geothermal and waste-to-energy plants are also enjoying an upswing in demand, especially as utilities work to comply with state laws that require a growing percentage of power to come from such renewables. But solar is the only clean energy source that just about anyone can install and manage for themselves. That's why the sun will be shining even brighter on investors who see the opportunity and catch the next solar powered wave."}, {"title": "A Big Culprit In California's Drought Starts With 'A' -- And It's Not Almonds", "text": "California's water-intensive almond industry has faced mounting criticism during the drought, especially after Gov. Jerry Brown announced that the state's first mandatory water cutbacks wouldn't apply to farmers. But  several deep looks into where the agriculture industry's water goes point to alfalfa, not almonds, as the drought-stricken state's biggest water guzzler, according to the latest data from the state Department of Water Resources, which groups almonds and pistachios together in its evaluations.Alfalfa is raised almost exclusively to feed livestock. California provides more than 80 percent of the world's almonds and just 2 percent of the world's beef. But growing enough alfalfa to feed an animal for its lifetime -- and enough water for the animal to drink -- is a more water-demanding process than raising the nuts. A 2012 study on global water footprints published in the journal Ecosystems found that beef requires more water  than any other agricultural product.Livestock production can be relocated outside the drought zone -- and many cattle ranchers have moved. Almonds, however, can only be grown on a vast scale in California, their producers say.“They really don’t grow well anywhere else in the world,” Richard Waycott, CEO of the California Almond Board, told Wired.Although California cattle production has been moving elsewhere, Gizmodo notes, the state's alfalfa sales have grown drastically because farmers are selling it to Asia, according to a report from the University of California Cooperative Extension.Graphic via GristGrowing almonds does require lots of water, with a single nut needing a gallon, Mother Jones points out. And the almond industry's growth from a $1.2 billion market in 2002 to a $4.8 billion market in 2012 has certainly put more pressure on water supplies. Unlike annual crops, almond orchards can't be left to fallow during drought.Smaller almond growers have been critical of  big almond investors looking to profit from the world's skyrocketing demand, planting in areas too dry for the nuts, The Associated Press reported.Still, protein-packed almonds pay off. Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik noted that fruits and nuts account for 45 percent of California's total agriculture revenue, but consume only 34 percent of agricultural water. Fruits and nuts are the only agriculture category that has a higher share of revenue than percentage of water used.\"For farmers, [almonds are] one of the highest-value commodities,\" Ellen Hanak, director of the Water Policy Center of the Public Policy Institute of California, told Hiltzik. \"The value of the water used on almonds is higher than on most crops.\"Graphics by Alissa Scheller."}, {"title": "Let's Make It Earth and Prosperity Day", "text": "Earth Day has made a long, strange trip from its beginnings in 1970.The first Earth Day was an outgrowth of the counterculture of the 1960s, triggered by an oil spill off the California coast and brought to life by a Democratic senator and a Republican congressman as a series of \"teach-ins\" on the environment. The scope was national, but the focus was largely local: Millions headed to U.S. parks, universities and city streets to raise awareness about the pollution of air and water, the destruction of wild places and the loss of wildlife that inhabited them.This same era of social upheaval saw the birth of another movement: The push to end extreme poverty. As the United States worked to bring more prosperity to its neediest through laws, known collectively as the War on Poverty, the United Nations and global financial institutions, including the World Bank, worked to aid the world's poorest.Since then, these two crucial drives -- to alleviate poverty and protect the environment -- have moved forward on parallel tracks. That needs to change, and this year's Earth Day highlights a new direction: Its theme is global citizenship, with a goal of economic growth and sustainability.The idea of linking these two agendas isn't new, but the urgency is.The turn of the 21st century saw the crafting of the Millennium Development Goals, a set of targets meant to alleviate extreme poverty in the developing world. They mentioned environmental issues, but the environment was an afterthought -- a goal with no real connection to the rest of the anti-poverty agenda. Development projects generally aimed, at most, at minimizing environmental impact.Meanwhile, the scientific community, including the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has provided increasingly stark evidence that the climate is changing and that human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels, are a key driver of that change. Beyond-sophisticated computer models, a number of trends tell the tale: 2014 was the hottest year globally in the modern record. The first three months of 2015 were also the hottest January, February and March on record. Arctic sea ice, another indicator of a warming planet, was at its lowest March extent ever, according to the U.S. National Climatic Data Center.While the global community has moved forward, it is not yet doing enough to meet the challenge. Global heat-trapping emissions continue to rise, ratcheting up the impact of a changing climate on countries least able to respond to it. The world is heading toward a new climate agreement in 2015, and it will take that and more to prevent the planet from heating up beyond two degrees C (3.6 degrees F) over pre-industrial levels.The problem with the development community and the environmental community going their own ways is that neither one of these giant problems can be solved without solving the other.There are hopeful signs that these two communities recognize their agendas are inextricably linked. International negotiators are working on a new set of development goals that aim to lift the poorest out of poverty while sustaining a healthy environment. These Sustainable Development Goals are expected to be agreed upon in September and support a global climate agreement in December in Paris. The World Bank and many other development banks are positioning themselves to tackle global environmental sustainability challenges.Perhaps Earth Day is the right time to ask some tough questions about how these agendas can move from commitments to concrete action.Let's ask the development community whether it is collectively willing to take the actions needed to tackle climate change, recognizing that if it doesn't, greater poverty could be the result. To finance and planning ministers, those keen to promote growth to reduce poverty and economic inequality, are they fully cognizant of the challenges posed by an unsustainable world? And are they willing to embrace policies equal to this challenge?Let's ask environmentalists if they have fully taken into account the plight of the world's poorest people, and made sure that environmental policies can help improve, not harm, their livelihoods? For example, do their plans to conserve biodiversity also support and improve human lives? Have they been truly honest about the negative impact some low-carbon solutions could have in the short-run on poor people? The New Climate Economy report sheds light on this topic showing that countries at all income levels can build lasting economic growth while reducing the risk of climate change -- if they act now, based on the most accurate data.When tens of thousands gathered on the National Mall on April 18 in a pre-Earth Day concert and rally, there were pop stars and speeches on a brilliant spring day, all aimed at building momentum for environmental sustainability and economic growth that work together. It was a far cry from the movement that began in the tie-dyed days when the environment was a new term and fixing it required protecting a local stream or picking up litter along a highway.The rest of 2015 offers the world a great challenge and a greater opportunity to join the environmental and economic growth agendas. Let's look for a clear-eyed realization that you can't tackle poverty and spur economic growth without protecting the environment, and you can't protect the environment without finding ways to make the economy grow while improving people's lives.Happy Earth and Prosperity Day."}, {"title": "The NSA's Earth Day Mascot Will Scare You Into Recycling", "text": "Americans throw a lot of trash away -- about 4.4 pounds per person every day. But the National Security Agency has a simple solution for our planet-killing ways: scare us into submission.The agency rolled out a new Earth Day mascot named \"Dunk\" this week. The living recycling bin looks a little like a blue Spongebob Squarepants with traumatized eyes, and it's been called \"creepy,\" \"disturbing\" and \"terrifying.\" Here's what he looks like:Despite the mascot's look somewhat unusual look, the NSA actually had a good reason to create Dunk. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that around 75 percent of all waste is recyclable, but less than a third is actually recycled. States like Florida have taken this pathetic statistic to heart, pledging to recycle or compost three-fourths of all trash by 2020, but others are lagging behind. In 2012, the latest year measured by the EPA, Americans generated about 251 million tons of solid waste.The NSA partnered with Maryland schools ahead of Earth Day to encourage STEM programs to cut down on their waste. An eight-minute video about the NSA's recycling efforts asks students to perform a trash audit in their classrooms, and cites a 25-year-old program at the agency that helps send more than 13 million pounds of garbage to recycling facilities every year. Maryland's recycling rates have hovered around 45 percent for the past few years.“When you see firsthand the trash that is generated in your school, we hope you’ll become more interested in reducing waste both at school and at home,” Dunk says in the video.So you may be a little terrified, but use that fear to help the planet.H/T Gizmodo"}, {"title": "Earth Day is Great.

Can one person really make a difference? I've asked this question myself. It can seem intimidating, even pointless sometimes. But the reality is, even the smallest decision, when implemented over and over again, can lead to a larger impact. Earth Day is an opportunity to start new habits that we can bring to the Every Day.I work at 1% for the Planet, and through our network, businesses across the globe commit to donating 1 percent of sales annually to nonprofits focusing on a range of environmental issues from food and water to land, species, and climate change.

The idea is to help Americans eat right, while informing nutrition standards for food assistance programs such as school meals. The \"Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\" (DGAC) has spent the past two years reviewing research and holding public hearings. The process is rigorous and the committee is not exactly radical.But when the DGAC's final report was issued at the end of February, the meat lobby went ballistic. That's because the committee made the not-so-surprising finding that eating too much red meat and processed meat can be bad for you. How bad? Numerous scientific studies have shown that red meat and processed meat increases the risk for colorectal cancer and other cancers, as well as for heart disease and diabetes.That's why the advisory committee recommends a diet \"lower in red and processed meats\". This would replace the current confusing (but meat lobby-friendly) message to \"choose lean meats.\" Americans deserve straight talk about how to eat right and this change, as minor as it seems, would represent a significant step forward by the federal government.Also, and for the first time, the DGAC considered the environmental impacts of our food choices, and came to the not-very-surprising conclusion that eating less meat and more plant-based foods is not only good for our health, but also supports a more sustainable food supply.No wonder the meat lobby got their friends in Congress to write letters to the government agencies in charge of the guidelines, calling for \"sound science.\" That's the meat lobby's euphemism for placing profits above public health.Don't let them win.You can submit your own comments supporting the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's recommendations to \"lower red meat and processed meats\" in the final guidelines, as well as a shift to more plant-based foods in general. Your message can be brief.

President Obama laid out the climate threat in his 2015 Earth Day message in the weekly address:\"The world's top climate scientists are warning us that a changing climate already affects the air our kids breathe,\" the president said. \"Last week, the surgeon general and I spoke with public experts about how climate change is already affecting patients across the country. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.\"Yet for all these facts, scientists proposing common-sense regulation of pollutants are rebuffed by corporate forces pushing to demoralize, defund, and ultimately destroy the bipartisan record of reform.Polluted politics allow Republican leaders and presidential contenders to take the \"I'm not a scientist\" approach so brilliantly skewered by Americans United for Change in their Webby-nominated #NotAScientist video: The Republican claims are laughable -- but the GOP budget cuts seeking to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy are deadly serious.Congressional Republicans have threatened to roll back the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts as well as EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gasses that cause climate change -- like carbon dioxide, mercury and methane, and protect U.S. waters from pollution.The Republicans' polluted policies are aided and abetted by polluted politics. From the Koch Brothers to Karl Rove's super PACs, oil and gas money is saturating politics like never before. Billions of dollars of corporate money have been belched into negative ads from the Republican side to fight those who support green politics. Not only are actual scientists demonized as radicals but corrosive initiatives are \"greenwashed\" into innocuous sounding initiatives. Remember, when polluters fund \"green\" initiatives, \"healthy skies\" mean the opposite. Sadly, millions of the individual actions by citizens to recycle, compost, reduce smog, drive hybrids, or go solar can be undercut by one greenwashed rule or regulation allowing unfettered \"voluntary\" actions by polluters despite known health and safety risks. This is wrong. We must insist on environmental policies that reinforce not undercut our environmental ethics.It doesn't have to be this way. As House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi often says: \"our Founders pledged their lives, their liberty and their sacred honor to build a democracy: a government of the many, not a government of the money.\"A government of the many would put public health over polluter profits and the voices of the people over the mouthpieces of polluters.A government of the many would ensure that an aspiring scientist can work to save lives knowing that her efforts will be peer reviewed not politically censored.A government of the many would push forward not roll back bipartisan climate leadership at home and abroad. A government of the many would secure the common good over corporate greed.A government of the many would not need an arms race of dueling SuperPACs (I use the term dueling advisedly considering the oil and gas interests' hundreds of millions spent in political ads and $141.4 million shelled out for lobbying compared to climate hawks' $100 million) in 2014 to define the issues -- candidates could do that for themselves.A government of the many would not outsource democracy to a handful of the wealthiest Americans but would instead inspire voters who are currently staying home in droves to come out and speak for ourselves and empower our representatives to speak for themselves.So potent is this cause that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton announced Citizens United reform as one of the key pillars of her 2016 campaign. A few Republicans may even join her. While no campaign will unilaterally disarm - you have to win in order to govern - a pledge to restore \"a government of the many\" is critical to the effort.What can we the people do to help?We build on our bipartisan coalitions between evangelicals and secular humanists, environmentalists and hunters to promote a conservationist message about clean energy. We identify the money as the message -- disclosing and exposing the donors as being in their own corporate interest not the people's. We advance Citizens United Reform movements to affirm that in fact only people not corporations are \"we the people.\"We begin in the spirit of Earth Day 2015's \"It's Our Turn to Lead\" theme with two steps:First, to repair our planet, join the efforts to protect bipartisan environmental health and safety reforms. The League of Women Voters has an Earth Day petition urging support for the work of the EPA to fight climate change, protect public health and grow our economy.Second, to reclaim our democracy, push to reduce the role of money in politics. Sign the petition of Citizens Against Citizens United and urge your friends to do the same.A healthier world requires a healthier American democracy.

Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\" - Margaret MeadMost people don't understand the plight of Earth and all living things. They go about their daily lives without so much as a care about the world around them. But that myopia has led us to the situation we are in today, which is dire. Burying our heads in the sand is no longer an option. We must face reality. Now.Our natural resources are finite, not endless. We depend on nature to supply us with fresh water, but as the climate warms, we cannot rely on melting snow that never fell. The atmosphere and air we breathe is under constant threat from pollution and other byproducts we humans create in our endless quest for a lifestyle filled with modern conveniences. The delicate balance of biodiversity that holds our ecosystems in check is precipitously hanging on the edge of the cliff, with only a few claws gripping the edge. These are such an overwhelming problems that most people don't know what to do.Changing of the world is not easy. We must start by changing our own personal behavior. We must accept the notion we can be happy with fewer material possessions, and success is not gauged by financial wealth but by the quality of the relationships we share with other people, animals and nature. Only then will the Earth's situation begin to improve.To facilitate this major shift in paradigm, we need everyone to buy in, including our governments and businesses. As leaders driving our society forward, they will need to be at the forefront of implementing this change, and they need to do so rapidly. We must demonstrate our desire for this change by voting in elections for the people who understand Earth's problems and are committed to solving them. We must spend our dollars with the companies who make products in an ethical, sustainable manner.In Namibia, the conservation programs we administer through Cheetah Conservation Fund integrate people's needs and livelihoods with the needs of the land and the environment in which they live. We believe that by looking at the community as a whole and carefully addressing the needs of all living creatures, we can maintain the delicate balance of biodiversity and conserve the ecosystem for generations to come.To celebrate Earth Day, I encourage you to engage others around you in discussion about our basic human values and the definition of happiness. I believe you will find that many more people than expected will agree that less is more, and that true happiness is not found in a new car or the latest technological gadget, but in the connections we have to the living creatures whose lives are supported by our planet. Even if they do not agree, you will have challenged their way of thinking and perhaps planted the seed of behavior change that will take root and one day bloom. This is a great way of showing respect for the Earth on April 22, 2015. By banding together on this day with this mission in mind, a small group of thoughtful, committed people can indeed change the world.From the perspective of Founder and Executive Director of Cheetah Conservation Fund -- by engaging in these discussions, you will also be helping ensure the cheetah and other endangered species have a place on Earth both today, and in the future.Happy Earth Day!"}, {"title": "Earth Day: A Two-step Strategy Makes a Sustainable Difference", "text": "Sustainability is top of mind as this week we mark Earth Day and Arbor Day, tributes aimed at raising respect for the environment. That makes this the perfect moment to note a new Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) report that says, \"Brands that place packaging\" into commerce must take more responsibility for its life cycle impact.Packaging as time-sensitive news? It may sound like a boring topic, but without packaging, more food would be wasted. Granted, food waste is already at critical levels, with more than 30 percent of food in the U.S. being wasted annually, according to National Geographic. But packaging plays a positive role in this equation. It protects food from early spoilage and helps extend its life by keeping it safe from contaminants and other external threats, notes an expert from Ohio State University. Nevertheless, we must continue to work together proactively to reduce waste, food waste and packaging waste.Packaging Is Likely To IncreaseHere is the crux of the issue: As we surge toward a mostly urban world population of more than 8 billion by 2030, according to strategy consultancy Roland Berger, the middle class will more than double to almost 5 billion, notes Reuters. More people with more spending power buy more products, which puts more packaging in the waste stream.A Two-step Strategy Can Change The EquationIn an ideal world, we would have fully sustainable packaging that is completely renewable and 100% recyclable with zero carbon footprint, and everyone would recycle all their waste. That scenario doesn't exist yet. But adopting a two-step approach of using packaging that is more sustainable and being conscientious about recycling packaging can help start to change the waste equation.One challenge lies in motivating businesses to embrace these practices given current realities. Although the global packaging market is projected to reach $975 billion by 2018, according to packaging consultancy Smithers Pira, only $244 billion of that expenditure will come from packaging with better environmental profiles, notes award-winning, green-packaging consultancy PulpWorks. This means only 25 percent of global packaging would meet today's criteria for sustainable packaging.Sustainable packaging, as it is defined today by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, embraces a broad array of characteristics that make it beneficial, safe and healthy for individuals and communities throughout its life cycle. These include: • increased use of recycled and/or renewable materials; • reduced material use, an issue as the world's renewable resources reach their limits, notes Geographical magazine; and • improved recycling and waste recovery rates thanks to design and compositionAnd all of the above should help with the waste equation in some way. Although we must make certain that packages can be recycled, ensuring we avoid waste during the design and manufacture of packages is critical. For example, packages that are made from sustainable and renewable materials--those that can be replenished over time--are lightweight, and therefore use a minimal amount of them help reduce waste of valuable natural resources.Recycling is a well-known practice to divert waste from landfills. However, it remains underutilized by consumers and businesses in the U.S. In fact, America \"has one of the lowest overall recycling rates of any developed nation. We recycle only half the packaging we use,\" says NRDC Executive Director Peter Lehner. Part of the problem is some packaging is difficult or impossible to recycle. Another concern lies in the U.S.'s underdeveloped recycling infrastructure; many communities don't have curbside programs for collecting and recycling their post-consumer packaging, notes Lehner.In response to recycling concerns, the carton packaging manufacturers Tetra Pak, Elopak, Evergreen and SIG Combibloc came together to found the Carton Council in 2009 to increase carton recycling in the U.S. Besides ensuring end markets and sorting infrastructure for carton recycling are in place, education is a large part of this effort since it is equally important to motivate consumers to use recycling bins. Today, 54 percent of American households are able to recycle cartons--a number we hope continues to increase.Now Is The Time For ChangeAccording to PulpWorks, the drive to make packaging more sustainable and recyclable will continue to grow in importance and is predicted to become the No. 1 global challenge facing companies--even more than costs--by 2023. And it is particularly important to Millennials, who \"view taking care of themselves and the environment as one and the same,\" notes a Brand Amplitude study.  As more companies connect environmental awareness with their bottom lines, and feel the heat of consumer opinion, those that embrace more sustainable packaging and play an active role in driving recycling will help achieve a lasting impact on the environment. The good news is that options for more sustainable packaging and opportunities for collaboration to drive recycling already exist, so we can start today."}, {"title": "Adrian Grenier Wants You to Get Angry About the Environment", "text": "Adrian Grenier wants you to get angry -- for all the right reasons; the actor has taken on his biggest role yet as an environmental activist. In the spirit of Earth Day, Grenier talked to us about his pet peeves when it comes to environmentally unfriendly habits and how he wants people to fight for their right to live in a healthy environment.What sparked your passion for the environment? You're one of the most well-known celebrity activists for the environment.  My passion for the environment comes from a human side, not my celebrity side. I care about people and I want everyone to have the human right to have a clean environment to live in a healthy environment to co-exist with. When businesses or other people are destroying or polluting the environment, it's an offense and I think it goes against our civil liberties.What's your pet peeve in terms of environmentally unfriendly practices that you see people doing more often than they probably realize?Using plastic bags are totally unnecessary and it's quite frustrating. It's also when people throw cigarette butts on the ground. It seems like such a minor, small thing but it goes into our water drainage systems and into the oceans and there are lots of chemicals and toxins. It seems innocent, but it's really not. It's one of the biggest human polluters and it's completely avoidable.What can people do daily to make their lives more sustainable?The options are fortunately great. Firstly, just get involved. Make the choice to be more engaged with what's happening. I've never believed in creating a list of to-dos because I always imagine the more you know, the more involved you get and the more you can actually be effective in helping. If you have a list, it's almost as if you check it off and you're done, but it's more of a mentality and a lifestyle and a decision to care.There's one thing I just recently learned -- and I've been doing this a long time -- and I just learned about this ratio with regards to fish. The reality is, specifically with shrimp, for example, there's 10 times the amount of bycatch to every pound of shrimp. [Editor's note: Though the amount of bycatch varies and can reach nearly 50 times the amount of shrimp caught, the global total is approximately 5.7 times bycatch for shrimp, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.]That's 10 pounds of indiscriminate and wasteful bycatch of other wildlife which is ultimately discarded and thrown back into the ocean dead, so whenever you have shrimp at dinner, you're not just responsible for the death of the shrimp, which at least you're eating for sustenance and their lives are not necessarily in vain, but you are actually also responsible for 10 times as many fish that die completely unnecessarily. This is a tragedy and it's all in the name of profits and cheap food. You can imagine all you can eat shrimp and the proposition there.I'm a very moderate environmentalist, believe it or not. I know that no one person can solve the problems of the planet. We really need to work together. That's why I try to do a lot of awareness work and try to get people into the conversation. There was a time when I thought I could fight everyone and do everything myself and I couldn't. It made me very sad and feeling helpless, but through a community of people all working together for the same goal, we can achieve great things.I really do believe we need to start with strong legislation and voting our conscience and voting for the environment and holding our politicians accountable to carry out these laws against people who violate them. There are some great laws that protect the environment and if we enforce the ones that exist, we can do a great job at least protecting the oceans from many illegal fisheries that are negatively affecting the ocean. In 20 years, we may not even have fish. We've fished 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean. That's insane. We need to get angry and put a lot of pressure on government.What was the pivotal moment for you that got you to get involved?Every day is another pivotal moment. When you're watching and have your eyes opened and ears and heart open, it's incredible how many reasons there are every day if you just look to why you should care and why you should be involved and try to find better ways of living on this planet. It can be daunting and upsetting, but it's ultimately exciting and inspiring because we have the opportunity to build a better world and we can imagine a place where we live in harmony with not just each other but also mother nature.What do you think is the most pressing issue in regards to our planet?I think it's the oceans. We need to really put a lot of focus on the oceans because a lot of people don't live on the oceans or live near the oceans and absolutely aren't living under the oceans, so a lot of this stuff seems absolutely not a sight that's even real, yet the effects are going to be very real and they're going to affect all of us so we need to be aware and connect with the oceans and be involved in helping them.Are you hopeful about people's attitude toward the environment?I'm very optimistic. Yes, I'm an optimist for sure. We've come a long way in society and civilization, so I feel like we can do great things, but I'm not resting on that hope and optimism. We have to actually do the work.Read Metro's Earth Day interview with Ian Somerhalder here."}, {"title": "Improved Efficiency Can Create 274K Jobs, Save $37 Billion", "text": "Few places teach us more about our world than the Florida Everglades, where water, sunlight, land and life mix to create the magnificent diversity in the natural systems we depend on to survive.All of that is threatened by climate change, in a way that mirrors the wider danger we face from the central environmental challenge of our time.Rising sea levels are turning freshwater marshland into saltwater coves in coastal parts of the Everglades like Cape Sable. Saltwater intruding into the porous limestone underneath the Everglades threatens fresh drinking-water supplies for seven million Floridians. And drought puts a crimp in the seasonal rains that renew fresh-water supplies each year, even as rising temperatures increase demand for its use.Those early-warning signs of climate change will be on display today when President Obama journeys to the Everglades for an Earth Day speech about the growing dangers of climate change.Rising seas, drought and extreme temperatures are just part of the package of peril we face unless we cut the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate chaos.Obama's Clean Power Plan can strike a real blow against the central environmental challenge of our time, by helping to clean up the dirty power plants that account for 40 percent of the nation's carbon footprint.Under the plan, we can cut power-plant carbon pollution 26 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030, when compared with 2005 levels. We can do even better than that, but what matters most is that we get started now.The Environmental Protection Agency, charged with implementing the plan, has laid out clear carbon-reduction targets that reflect each state's specific energy mix.What's critical now is for states to decide how to reach those goals, while power companies determine the most cost-effective way to hit the targets.Some may opt to promote energy efficiency, so families and businesses can do more with less. An NRDC analysis finds we can create more than 274,000 jobs, while helping households and businesses save more than $37 billion a year on their electric bills, by improving efficiency.Other power companies may, for instance, tune up aging generating capacity to reduce their carbon footprint, get more power from the wind and sun, or any combination of all these ideas.The important thing is that we get the job done.Last year was the hottest since record-keeping began in 1880. The 16 hottest years have all occurred since 1997. And the first quarter of this year was the hottest ever.We can't wait any longer to act. The stakes are too high for that. That's the message from the Everglades this Earth Day -- and we hear it loud and clear.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment. The series is putting a spotlight on initiatives and solutions that are actually making a difference -- whether in the battle against climate change, or tackling pollution or other environmental challenges.

As far as food goes, it urges us to go meatless on Mondays, but encourages environment-damaging dairy and eggs even then. The Earth Day site offers a classroom plan for 8th grade teachers that has students calculate the environmental impact of eating 100 cheeseburgers a year. The students don't compare cheeseburgers to bean burgers (although I do below). Worse, they are told to keep eating beef burgers! The teacher's guide says:Remember to discuss with students that this activity is not meant to make them stop eating hamburgers. Instead, it's meant to draw attention to how choices we make everyday impact the environment.Attention to our impact is not enough: flip the paradigmFor that matter, other steps the Earth Day site suggests are trivial. Reduce junk mail? But our approach to eating has a big effect. The report from the United Nations, Livestock's Long Shadow, says 18 percent of our greenhouse gases come from raising animals for food. Over 8 percent of the water we use also goes to raising animals. Who do you think eats all that alfalfa that's sucking up the water in California?I am currently reading The Sixth Extinction and am more convinced than ever that we need to change our abuse of the planet dramatically right now. Meatless Monday was a great start, but it's time to flip the paradigm. Eat meat and other animal products only one day a week or better yet not at all.According the Environmental Working Group's Meat-Eater's Guide to Climate Change and Health:If you eat one less burger a week, it's like taking your car off the road for 320 miles or line-drying your clothes half the time. If your four-person family skips meat and cheese one day a week, it's like taking your car off the road for five weeks - or reducing everyone's daily showers by 3 minutes.That means 33 four-ounce servings of beans have the same mileage as 1 four-ounce serving of beef!Carbon footprint: 1 cheeseburger = 2.75 bean burgersWhen I did the suggested classroom exercise and then extrapolated the carbon footprint of a bean burger using the EWG's figures above, I found that a cheeseburger has about 2.75 times the carbon footprint of a bean burger. That's with the same bread, lettuce, pickles, and even the freeze-dried onions from the classroom plan. I'd use local spring onions, lettuce, and pickles, which would cut the energy used in transportation and storage further. Homemade bean burgers are delicious and easy to make, too.My Low-Fat Bean Burgers for Earth Day and Every Day These bean burgers satisfy when you want something tasty on a bun to go with the ketchup, mustard, and onions. Top them with salsa and guacamole for a Tex-Mex twist. You can also crumble the burgers to use in tacos or on pizza.Because fat-free bean burgers freeze and reheat well, you can make a batch or two on a cooler day to enjoy when it's too hot to move or when you have company who prefers a lean, green option. These bean burgers are vegan, gluten free, and high in fiber as well as being free of added fat and cholesterol. I minimize the packaging and cost by cooking my own dried beans. If you use canned beans, rinse them well.Get the full directions and more pictures on my Cook for Good website. You'll also find many other organic vegan recipes that make it easy to eat like it's Earth Day every day."}, {"title": "Why Some Profit-Hungry Corporations Hate Earth Day", "text": "April 22, 1970, the first Earth Day, represented a surge of protests and activism that pushed our government to respond to \"We the People\" and protect our common interest over special interest groups.  The government formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a unified Congress -- something rarely seen today -- passed countless acts to safeguard our air and water; defend consumer product safety, pesticide control, and more. And as the Watergate Scandal played out, politicians toughened electoral laws like restricting campaign spending. But by end of the 1970s, slick pro-business operatives had distorted the victories of environmental allies and anti-corruption reformers.  With the help of a tobacco industry lobbyist and soon-to-be Justice Lewis Powell, corporations turned their profit-hungry rancor into an ideological fight with spin-doctor Powell calling reformers Communists in a famous memo. Supporters of pollution regulation became welfare-mongering Commies who wanted to attack the American free enterprise system. If you believed in equal opportunity to clean air, Powell's acolytes would accuse you of hating freedom -- brushing past our country's historic efforts towards striking a balance between freedom and equality.  Corporations recognized they needed to obtain political power to really start hacking away at the \"public\" part of our public servants' role to protect the environment. And they did so with the help of the Supreme Court. Justice Powell, who by 1976 sat on the Supreme Court, pushed forward the doctrine of \"money equating speech\" in the Buckley v. Valeo ruling and later wrote a decision that said corporate donations in state ballot initiatives were protected under the first amendment as political speech.  This is how corporations that profited from clogging lungs and manufacturing leaded gasoline, which seeps into people's bloodstreams, found their moral stride. They smeared the champions of effective government, and out of Powell's legal blueprints came today's Supreme-Court-approved corporate takeover of Washington with unrestricted corporate spending in elections.  But today, millions of Americans are starting to see that big money in politics is the biggest roadblock to a fair and free government. And the campaign finance reform movement has really begun to takeoff. The Washington Post's Matea Gold headlined her front-page article this week, \"Big money in politics emerges as a rising issue in 2016 campaign.\"  Over 30,000 people have joined the grassroots campaign, StampStampede.org, to further build momentum by legally rubber stamping their cash with anti-corruption messages like \"Not to be used for bribing politicians.\" It's a petition on steroids -- the average stamped dollar is seen over 800 times, while the traditional petition tends to land on one person's desk. Activists are marching in the streets, bird-dogging presidential hopefuls, and contacting their legislators to demand our government prioritize \"We the People\" over a small percentage of well-heeled individuals and groups.  While Earth Day may signal the start of the modern environmentalist movement, activists have been fighting for air pollution restrictions since the 1920s. This day is a reminder that change takes time and work, and decades of commoditized political influence can only be undone by \"We the People\" through a constitutional amendment that states, \"Money is not free speech -- and corporations are not people.\""}, {"title": "Striking a Deal to Save the World's Forests", "text": "Tucked away in the Himalayas you'll find Bhutan -- one of the smallest countries in the world, but blessed with an abundance of natural treasures and beauty. It's a fairy-tale landscape. Endless forests and mountains home to 700 species of birds; a network of 10 protected areas, mainly lush forests where Royal Bengal tigers and their cubs roam freely; rivers that support livelihoods for some if its 750,000 people (and that are part of a larger network across several countries that provides freshwater for at least one-fifth of the Earth's population).The country may be small, but their commitment to conservation is bigger than most. Protecting the environment is one of the four pillars of Bhutan's Gross National Happiness philosophy. As mandated in its constitution, Bhutan preserves (at all times) at least 60 percent of its land under forest cover.But the modern world is transforming this tiny ecological and cultural gem.WWF's 2014 Living Planet Report, a biennial progress report of our planet's overall environmental health, reported a more than 60 percent decline in the essential services provided by nature (freshwater production, carbon sequestration, forest growth). All indicators related to our mission -- from biodiversity to climate change to natural-resource scarcity -- trend in the wrong direction and affect every country in the world, including Bhutan. In fact, Bhutan has changed more in the last 50 years than the previous 500. Rapid modernization has brought its share of difficulties for Bhutan's government. The country's natural resources face unprecedented threats, despite the political will and conservation milestones.Bhutan, like others around the world, works to find the right balance between fostering economic development and conserving its landscape and natural resources. The government recognizes the intrinsic value of its natural infrastructure, most particularly its forests, to the future of the country, whether it's retaining intact watersheds that fuel the country's hydropower, or the distinctive ecotourism model that makes it unique in the world. Bhutan's protected-areas system now conserves 51% of the country. Without ongoing financing for management of its forests, Bhutan stands to lose that natural infrastructure and the economic pillars that depend upon its forests remaining pristine.The government just made a bold move to protect its forests. Forever.Working with WWF and others, Bhutan now leads an effort to create a financial-reserve fund to ensure its natural ecosystems will be protected in perpetuity. Taken straight from Wall Street's financial playbook, Bhutan, along with the private sector, corporate and multi-lateral partners, plans to invest in its conservation future using an innovative and transformational financial plan we call Project Finance for Permanence.It's a financial model that relies on a multi-party, single closing, where all funders bring their money to the table at once in an all-or-nothing closing. Funds aren't distributed until the entire fundraising-commitment goal has been reached and other agreed-upon conditions have been met. If the consortium fails to reach the total funding goal, nobody pays.The financial approach begins with a performance-based conservation plan with a targeted set of goals and milestones. All details are ironed out before a single dollar is invested. It's an up-front guarantee for donors that something real is going to happen. They can rest assured that they're leaving something permanent behind for future generations. In the case of Bhutan, the government will increase its spending until it fully assumes the cost of managing its protected areas.A global project-finance-permanence approach promises a much greater impact in a shorter amount of time. More importantly, it delivers conservation results that match the scale of the threats we face. We know this works. It's been successfully deployed in Brazil, Costa Rica and British Columbia.In May 2014, the Brazilian government, WWF and others, created a $215 million fund to permanently protect 150 million acres of the Brazilian Amazon. When Brazil announced what they had done at the World Congress on Biodiversity in Korea this past year, scores of countries told us they wanted the same.In addition to working with Bhutan, we're now working with the government of Peru, the Moore Foundation and others, to permanently financially protect that country's network of protected areas.Project Finance for Permanence is one of the greatest innovations of our time to secure permanent funding for our precious and vulnerable landscapes. It holds governments accountable to their long-term conservation commitments. It moves away from year-by-year transactions which are often not sufficient to fully fund conservation initiatives. And it enables governments to assume the long-term costs upon the project's completion.We need to find solutions that are as big as the conservation challenges we face. Securing long-term financial security for national-park systems takes a big step in the right direction.This post is part of a Huffington Post What's Working series on the environment.

Let's Join Together and Save the Honeybee!", "text": "Forty-five years ago, the first Earth Day spawned great progress for our air, water and natural areas. The day activated millions of Americans, brought together political leaders of all stripes, and led to the passage of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other bedrock environmental laws. Today, the annual day of action for the environment still inspires more than 1 billion people across the globe.This Earth Day while celebrating our big accomplishments, we also need to think about something small: the honeybee. Though less than an inch long, the tiny honeybee has major implications for our food supply. In addition to providing us with honey and aiding the beauty of our gardens, honeybees are responsible for pollinating an estimated 71 percent of the world's most widely consumed food crops, including almonds, squash, apples, avocados and more.Image: Flickr User: Fried Dough - Creative CommonsUnfortunately, despite decades of environmental progress, today our food supply and our gardens are in trouble. Bees are dying by the millions. U.S. bee populations have reached historic lows, and we're losing nearly a third of our bee colonies each year -- a rate that more than triples what was once considered normal.Scientists point to a complex web of factors, including climate change and habitat destruction, to explain the massive collapse of bee colonies here and across the world. But a certain class of insecticides has emerged as a clear culprit. Sharing the same chemical properties as nicotine, neonicotinoids are neurotoxins that can kill bees directly. In addition, these chemicals can disorient them and make it harder for them to get back to their hives. And they can create long-term health and reproductive problems for bee populations.Image: Waugsberg / Wikimedia Creative CommonsMore than 30 lab studies have shown that these pesticides are a danger to bees. Yet nearly three-quarters of U.S. farms are doused with neonics each year, and up to half of garden plants currently sold in retailers Walmart, Home Depot, and Lowes have been pre-treated with the harmful chemicals.Slowly, that's beginning to change. The state of Oregon just enacted a limited ban on four types of neonics. Major garden-supply retailers Lowes recently announced it will phase out the use of neonics in its pesticides and garden plants. And earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a modest step forward when it announced it would likely ban new uses of the pesticide.But more must be done. And Earth Day is a perfect day for action.To reverse today's alarming honeybee decline, let's all call for governments and corporations to ban neonics. And if you're planting a garden this spring, you also can help save the bees in your in own backyard. Don't use pesticides or plants and seeds treated with them. And whether your garden spans a flower box or your entire yard, include plants that bees love, such as native wildflowers, flowering herbs, and berries.This Earth Day, let's certainly celebrate our big accomplishments. But don't forget to think of the little honeybee too. Support efforts to ban neonics, plant a bee-friendly garden, and protect honeybees for the summer and years to come so that on future Earth Days, along with celebrating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act we can celebrate the revival of the honeybees."}, {"title": "A Planetary Perspective", "text": "We're on a planet.We're on a planet that breathes, pulsing with water and soil and love.We're on a planet that cradles life without demand, turn after turn.We're on a planet that is ripe with gifts.We're on a planet that is running out: out of water, out of air, out of time.\"We're on a planet, and we are planetary.\" Guy Reid tells me. Reid is the director of the documentary Planetary, a visually stunning cinematic journey that takes its audience to space and back.The film insists that we are more than individual humans inhabiting a rock spinning through the galaxy.It insists that we are one; inextricably linked by the stardust in our veins, a collective consciousness dependent upon the cooperation of its parts, earth to sky, mountain to sea.It insists that this collective is a single organism, simultaneously of the planet and of the cosmos: in a word, planetary.Its insistence delivers.Planetary was born from the seeds of collaboration. The film was funded through Kickstarter in 2012, and its viral success on that platform reflects the appeal of its message. The short film Overview, a 19 minute prologue to Planetary and cornerstone of the campaign, amassed 1 million views by the end of its first day on Kickstarter. Without any press. At the campaign's close, Overview had 7 million views and Planetary had 1,400 backers.Clearly, something hooked people. It sure hooked me.I don't remember how I arrived at it, but I do remember that I watched Overview three times in a row. I was stunned by how it made me feel. Many films can bring tears to one's eyes, but not many films can bring tears to one's heart.For the first time I not only saw the fragility our planet, I felt it.That feeling is precisely what connects people to Planetary.\"We'd articulated something that people had always felt. Something that they'd always understood: that the earth is beautiful and fragile and precious, and that we are all connected to it,\" says Steve Watts Kennedy, producer, writer and editor of Planetary.\"That's not a philosophical position, it's a fact,\" he says. \"We just wanted to share that idea. And I think that's why people have shared the film so much.\"No one is better positioned to talk about the fragility of our planet than an astronaut. Viewing the earth as a tiny blue dot while floating amid the stars is an experience most humans will never have. Planetary uses the unique perspective of astronauts to illustrate the earth's vulnerability in a way that is as extraordinary as it is simple.Ron Garan is one of them. A retired NASA astronaut, Garan has traveled 71,075,867 miles in 2,842 orbits of our planet during more than 178 days in space.Seeing the planet for months at a time from space was an unprecedented vantage point for Garan. He spent most of his free time aboard his first mission with his face plastered to the window, looking back at earth.\"I launched into space on my first mission with the belief that we have all the technology and resources necessary to fix the problems facing our planet,\" Garan says, \"...and I came to the conclusion that the primary reason we still face so many critical issues lies in our inability to effectively collaborate on a global scale.\"Wanting to use his unique perspective to inspire change, Garan wrote a book called The Orbital Perspective as a first step, which Planetary draws upon.\"Planetary is also a step in that direction,\" he says. \"We have a collaborative nature as a human species. We've lost that a little bit, and we need to get back to it.\"The theme of human collaboration is a cornerstone of the film, and the idea is not unique to modern space-travelers. Planetary features tribal elders from various cultures who discuss the importance of seeing ourselves as together rather than separate.It is vital to our continued existence. It always has been.\"I left space with this call to action not to accept the current status quo on our planet, to spread this idea that we can change things, we can change the trajectory of our global society,\" says Garan.\"We have the power to reduce the suffering that exists on our planet. We are in a position now,\" Garan insists, \"where we have to collaborate to save our lives.\"It's that very message which comes across so clearly in the film, and touches people in a profound way through words, imagery and sound.\"The thing about astronauts,\" director Guy Reid suggests, \"is you can't argue with that view from space. You can't argue that the planet isn't one system. There's power in the fact that you're not even making an argument, you're just sharing a perspective.\"Planetary is the brainchild of Guy Reid and Steve Watts Kennedy, lifelong friends who conceived the idea for the project as 15 year old kids sitting together on a park bench in Bristol, England; a city known more for its contribution to underground dance music than cosmic philosophy. Inspired to action by a book called The Global Brain Awakens by English physicist Peter Russell, Reid and Kennedy say they purchased dozens of copies from a secondhand shop and gave them away to friends.\"No one read them,\" Kennedy laughs. The guys decided a film might be more enticing.In 2010 Reid and Kennedy, along with Planetary's director of photography Christopher Ferstad, formed Planetary Collective. The Collective is a creative organization \"dedicated to worldview interruption.\" It uses art and technology as tools to change humanity's perspective not only of the planet, but of itself. Planetary was born from the collaborative efforts of the Collective, which connects with creatives from all walks of life who embody the ethos it represents.So, now what? I ask them. The film leaves us with an awakened feeling that's hard to ignore, but the question of where to go from here remains.Reid states simply, that it's time to reconsider.\"That feeling, it allows you to reconsider,\" he says. He points out that the etymology of the word itself is fascinating: consider is from the Latin root words cum and sidera, which literally means, with the stars.A film may not singlehandedly alter the course of human action, but if it allows us to reconsider our choices, to reconsider our connection to this planet, perhaps we'll move toward togetherness.Perhaps we'll remember that we are already with the stars.** Planetary is set for worldwide release on Earth Day in theaters and on Vimeo on Demand.

Beginning in 2010, in its Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon warned that while climate change \"alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.\"This was followed up in 2014, when the Pentagon once again warned that the effects of climate change are \"threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions - conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\"Finally, this year, a groundbreaking study concluded that the Zero Hour had come. Climate change, indeed, contributed to conditions that hastened the rise of extremism, in the form of ISIS, in Syria.From the Scientific American article covering the study:\"Drying and drought in Syria from 2006 to 2011--the worst on record there--destroyed agriculture, causing many farm families to migrate to cities. The influx added to social stresses already created by refugees pouring in from the war in Iraq, explains Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who co-authored the study. The drought also pushed up food prices, aggravating poverty. \"We're not saying the drought caused the war,\" Seager said. \"We're saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict. And a drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human-driven drying of that region.\"It isn't that tough to imagine other potential hot spots. We already have documented evidence of increased migration from Pakistanis, who are moving from ground that has become less fertile due to climate change. The 2014 QDR found that, \"the pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.\" Indeed. What happens when areas of Pakistan continue to dry up? Already home to terrorist activity, resource shortages and tensions with India could hasten the growth of terror networks. Think it sounds like some environmentalist scare tactic?It's already happening:\"Extremist groups, of which there is no dearth in Pakistan, have also weighed in on the matter, using it as an opportunity to garner support for their movement. Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the militant group, Lakshar-e-Taiba--the organization behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks--has unequivocally blamed India for Pakistan's water crunch, accusing its government of committing \"water terrorism.\" By evoking an issue that is sensitive to millions of Pakistanis, Saeed's rhetoric demonstrates the potential of militant groups to exploit this issue.\"As someone who has served in the Iraq war, and has had to help fight terrorists there, I can tell you unequivocally, this is not a path we want to go down. We have the best military in the world, but as we saw, it became strained by fighting two wars at once. I have seen what three, four, and five deployments have done to our force structure, and readiness, and it is not good. If terror networks accelerate their growth, aided by climate change, our military may reach its breaking point, trying to contain the spread of terrorism and upheaval it causes. This doesn't even take into account all of the humanitarian aid our military would have to provide to the millions who would be suffering.And, with every bit of terrorist growth, America would become more at risk of attack.Still, we have another choice. To slow the pace of climate change, with an eye towards stopping it, in the long run. That will mean serious, drastic action. It will mean expanding the use of carbon-free forms of energy, from wind and solar, to better hybrid and electric vehicles, and protecting the Renewable Fuel Standard, used in our current fuel supply, which lessens the amount of money that flows to terrorist groups, who shoot at our troops. It will not be easy. And it will not be cheap.But think of it this way. When we find out someone is sponsoring terrorism, we act. We freeze funds. We sanction them. And, rightly or wrongly, we sometimes even strike at them with drones. We act, and we act decisively. Why wouldn't we act the same way against this foe?Today, on Earth Day, let's continue to protect ourselves, and ask our politicians to vote for policies that protect us.

As long as the corporate leadership has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the investments of their stockholders, they have no choice but to make profits their \"bottom line.\" True, they can sometimes use token environmental steps to assuage the consciences of some of their investors, customers or clients, but only to the extent that those can be shown to contribute to their old bottom line of money and power. Individually, many people in these corporations are very decent human beings, and some go home from work and contribute to environmental causes. But they know they will lose their jobs if they don't promote the old bottom line. And to do that, many of those corporations will have to extract resources from the earth in the cheapest possible way, engage in environmentally destructive processes in extracting, refining, and producing their goods, moving their operations to other corners of the globe where environmental restrictions are less constraining and/or workers' pay easier to restrict to low levels, safety conditions less rigorously enforced. In the process, air, water, and ground land will be increasingly polluted and we and our children and grandchildren will pay the consequences. Sadly, many of the very people who care most about these issues will nevertheless provide the funding for candidates in 2016 who are too timid to address these issues, or too misguided, but instead will insist that \"growth\" is the golden calf which must be worshipped (as though the earth were a bottomless cookie jar and one could take without restraint or worry about future generations).But there is a solution to all this. Partly it involves a new consciousness that is already developing in which we come to see the earth not primarily as a \"resource\" to use for human benefit, but as a sacred source of life that deserves to be responded to with respect, love, awe, wonder and radical amazement, and come to see ourselves as part of the earth and able to feel and mourn the assaults on it in ways similar (not exactly the same, but close) to the ways we would experience an Islamic State ISIL or Boku Haram fundamentalist terrorist hacking off one of our limbs. When we can feel that pain, we will stop eating cows and other forms of meat and allowing forests to be cut down so that cows or other animals can be grown for consumption. We will join efforts to get our governmental bodies, universities, religious and civic institutions, and anywhere we have investments or savings accounts to disinvest in corporations with dubious environmental practices, and we will refuse to buy their services or products.But that can't be enough. If most oil companies are among the worst polluters, you still have to get to work and there are no mass transportation options, you may feel bad but you'll continue to buy the oil from one polluter or another. If organic food is only available at higher prices than the more polluted foods, but your children are hungry and you have been one of the tens of millions of Americna workers whose wages have not grown significantly plus now you have to buy various electronics to keep your children from being seen as bizarre if they don't own what \"everyone else\" is giving their kids, you'll sacrifice a little on organic foods and eat ones that may or may not in the long run cause a variety of health problems.Moreover, the 1% of the richest people in the advanced industrial countries have so much more disposable income than almost everyone else that the economic marketplace will respond far more to their interests than the interests of tens of millions of others. The consumer marketplace doesn't respond on the basis of one consumer one vote, but rather one dollar one vote. And the top 1% owns more of those dollars than the 50% of Americans earning below the median income level.A first step is to promote a New Bottom Line, so that every corporation, government policy, our legal system, health care system, educational system, and every other major system is judged efficient, rational and productive to the extent that they maximize love and caring, environmental sustainability and responsibility, ethical behavior and generosity, enhance our capacities to treat other human beings not merely instrumentally to achieve fulfillment our own personal needs but as sacred beings, and our capacities to transcend a narrow utilitarian or instrumental approach to nature and instead respond to the Earth and to the universe with awe, wonder and radical amazement at the grandeur and preciousness of all that is (of which we each are an important part). This New Bottom Line is a way of making whatever \"new story\" or \"new consciousness\" become a reality in our daily lives. But to make that happen, we need to translate this New Bottom Line into specific programs.That's why we at Tikkun and the interfaith (but also secular-humanist and atheist-welcoming) Network of Spiritual Progressives have developed two key programs that can make a major difference: The ESRA and the Global Marshall Plan.The ESRAThe ESRA (Environmental and Social Responsibility Amendment to the US Constitution) has the following planks:1. It bans all private money from state and federal elections and permits only public funding, thereby eliminating the huge advantage that the super-rich have to shape the Congress, the presidency, and the various state legislatures. This is a far more powerful step than allowing the Congress to set limits on money donations by overturning \"Citizens' United\" decision of the Supreme Court. ESRA also does make clear that corporations are not \"persons\" with rights that are granted to human beings in the Constitution and that money is not a form of speech protected by the Constitution.2. It requires the wealthier corporations (those with incomes of over $50 million/yr--but excluding all the small businesses) get a new corporate charter once every five years which will only be granted to corporations that can prove a satisfactory history of environmental behavior and social responsibility--to a panel of ordinary citizens who will also hear the testimony of people from around the world who have had their lives impacted by the behavior of the corporation being reviewed. The system of \"regulatory agencies\" doesn't work--the regulated corporations have succeeded in getting their own leaders, lobbyists or other loyalists, appointed to these agencies by presidents of both major parties--so the ESRA extends to ordinary citizens (with environmental experts as consultants) the ability to decide the fate of corporations just as our legal system now gives those citizens the right to decide the fate of fellow citizens facing crimes that might even lead to a death sentence. The ESRA specifies a set of areas that the panel must consider, but it can also bring in other environmentally relevant considerations. This part of the ESRA applies to all corporations selling goods or services in the US (whether based here or not) as well as US corporations operating only outside the US, and it provides a massive incentive to corporations to change their corporate behavior (because with the ESRA, the environmentally sensitive people within corporations will be able to insist to their corporate leadership and to investors that they risk losing their license to function and hence the investments of their stock holders totally unless they dramatically change their practices to be dramatically and demonstrably less destructive to the environment).3. It requires every school from k-to graduate or professional levels to teach environmental practices, latest information, skills both in working with and protecting Nature but also in empathic communication, caring for everyone on the planet, and learning how to organize and use democratic and nonviolent methods for protecting the earth and humanity's future.4. It overturns any treaty or trade agreement (including the currently secretly negotiated TPP that Obama and the Republicans in Congress have sought to give \"fast track\" approval) which can be shown to be destructive to the wellbeing of the environment or to working people or is judged by a court to stand in conflict with the intent or specifics of the ESRA. It also requires corporations which seek to move assets or operations out of the US to provide reparations and compensation to the people of the area in which it previously had been operating. And all terms of the ESRA apply equally to any firms to which these larger firms subcontract.Though it is written more like legislation than like previous constitutional amendments, a necessity given the propensity of the corporate-oriented Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional Congressional legislation and past Supreme Court decisions that limit corporate political and economic power, the Constitution does NOT specify what form an amendment can or cannot take. And while the Congress in the next few years (probably until post 2020 elections and the subsequent reapportionment and redrawing of electoral districts that might then be possible) is unlikely to pass this amendment, it may become easier for our movement to win support of State Legislatures which could call a Constitutional Convention to consider this and related potential amendments.The Domestic and Global Marshall PlanI wish I could say that this would be enough, but it needs another piece. No matter how effective this will be in the U.S., as long as people around the world are facing starvation or extremes of poverty, they will have a massive incentive to cut down the forests and sell their minerals and produce in environmentally destructive ways to sell their products in the international capitalist marketplace. So it becomes a major environmental measure to eliminate global poverty, homelessness, inadequate education and inadequate health care--so that people do not have to choose between the short term survival interests of their families on the one hand and the long term environmental safety of their children on the other. Hence the need for the Domestic and Global Marshall Plan (download the full 32-page brochure at www.tikkun.org/gmp).The Domestic and Global Marshall Plan (GMP) calls upon the US to take the leadership by example in convincing all the top 20 industrial powers to dedicate 1-2% of their gdp each year for the next twenty to eliminate (not reduce or ameliorate, as the Millenium goals and other UN summits aim at) poverty, homelessness, hunger, inadequate education, inadequate health care, and to repair the environmental damage caused by 150 years of irresponsible forms of industrialization pursued by self-described capitalist, socialist and communist societies.The plan is too detailed to lay out fully here, which is why I am urging you to read it at www.tikkun.org/gmp. But its key elements avoid the past failures of aid programs. It ensures that monies will go to working people and poor people in localities, not to national elites of political or economic power or to US corporations using the money to adance their own interests. It overturns all trade arrangements that have led to impoverishment of local farmers around the world to the benefit of the advanced industrial countries, particularly the U.S. It eliminates all loans from US and other banks and private agencies to poor developing countries. It creates local and international governing bodies composed of social change activists and cultural and spiritual leaders in the relevant recipient countries. It encourages and seeks to develop an understanding that homeland security is best served by a spirit of generosity (embodied in this GMP) rather than by military, economic, political or cultural domination. And much more. If implemented as described, it would end the immigration crisis faced by the US and Europe, because people would no longer have to risk their lives to get to the advanced industrial countries as their only way to get income sufficient to provide for their families without having to sell their children into prostitution or to engage in the international drug trade.Congressman Keith Ellison of Minneapolis has introduced a House Resolution to support this proposed GMP.What you can do is to build support for the ESRA and GMP in every possible place where you interact with others. You can seek to get them endorsed by your civic or religious organization, the social change organization to which you are affiliated, your union or professional organization, your universities and local school districts, the local branch of the political party to which you belong, your city council, state legislature, and representatives to Congress. And you can join our organization, the Network of Spiritual Progressives and work with us on a concerted campaign to save the environment.

But in Washington, she's found herself the target of numerous attacks from conservatives.\"For me, the environment has never been a partisan issue,\" McCarthy told The Huffington Post. \"I deal with science and facts. And I try to make the most reasonable decisions I can, so that the environment can be recognized as really part and parcel of the foundation of a growing economy.\"\"I have never had any difficulty working for either a Republican or a Democrat, as long as they allow me to do my job, as long as we can keep politics out of it and real policy involvement in it,\" she said. \"I think that we do a pretty good job here at EPA in trying to stay out of the politics and stay in our lane, which is to really speak for the American public and protect their right to clean air and clean water and healthy land.\"But McCarthy's agency is often the subject of attacks from the right. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pledged to do whatever he can \"to get the EPA reined in.\" Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul has called the EPA \"abusive and power-hungry,\" arguing that the agency has \"done more harm than good.\" During the 2014 election, Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst said she'd like to shut down the EPA entirely.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently joked that he's glad he doesn't have McCarthy's job. \"I wake up every morning, I say my prayers and I'm thankful that I'm not the EPA administrator,\" he told a House committee.McCarthy shrugged off the attacks. \"I’m happy that EPA is doing its job,\" she said. \"I am honored to be able to defend the decisions of the agency and speak on its behalf.\"\"As long as we do the job that Congress gave us, with the authorities that Congress gave us, and we do it as well as we can within the law and science, we do it as transparently as we can, I will be able to stand up and be very proud of our efforts,\" she continued. \"We’re doing the work we’re supposed to do.

But in the past year, we've also seen a surge in awareness of our own dependence on our planet's living ecosystems -- an awareness that may, just may, spark the kind of action needed to get us out of this mess.By Steve Zwick and Ann Espuelas This post first appeared on The AnthropoZine. Click here to view the original.22 April 2015 | Two days after posting what may be the first rap song about ecosystem services, spoken-word artist Prince Ea has drawn nearly 25 million visitors to the video of his song \"Sorry\", which begins as a hypothetical apology to future generations but mutates into a call to action inspired by visits to forest carbon projects in Africa: Kenya's Kasigau Wildlife Corridor Project  and the Democratic Republic of Congo's Mai Ndombe Forest Conservation Project.\"Trees are amazing,\" he says. \"We literally breathe the air they are creating. They clean up our pollution, our carbon. They store and purify water. They give us medicine that cures our diseases, food that feeds us, which is why I'm so sorry to tell you that we burned them down.\"To save them, he adds, \"We must...realize that we are not apart from nature; we are a part of nature, and to betray nature is to betray us. To save nature is to save us.\"After the ode to ecosystem services ends, Ea implores his fans to \"balance the amount of pollution that you yourself give off\" by purchasing offsets through the Stand for Trees program, which aggregates forest-carbon offsets from across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Judging by his Facebook page, people are getting the message. \"You nail it once again,\" wrote James Cleave of London. \"Thank you. I've donated.\"Purists will argue that offsets aren't really \"donations\"; they're \"payments for ecosystem services\" (a subtle but important distinction that underlines the value of nature, rather than the goodness of the giver), but it's still reassuring to see an entertainer reaching out to a mainstream audience with a challenging message that goes beyond the usual bromides and broadsides we're accustomed to. Can it be that the innovative financing mechanisms pioneered in the 1970s are also finally beginning to resonate among the larger community?Here's a few reasons why the answer may be \"yes\".Water conservation and management. In Peru, the Ministry of Environment has been working in partnership with Ecosystem Marketplace publisher Forest Trends to develop the Watershed Services Incubator, which promotes cost-effective methods to maintain watershed services and keep the water flowing in Lima, one of the world's largest desert cities. The program works with Lima's water utility, SUNASS, implementing highly innovative solutions to the dire problem of sustaining our water supply.Protecting the forests that store carbon - with finance, not fences. The financing mechanism called REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) supports the protection of \"ecosystem services\" (living forests, for example, which suck carbon out of our atmosphere). One such recent REDD success story comes from the Madre de Dios region of Peru, where the Tambopata REDD Project aims to support 1,100 farmers on sustainable cocoa production and protect a biodiverse national reserve, with help from a $7 million investment by Althelia Climate Fund.Supporting the stewards of the forests. A consortium of nine environmental and indigenous organizations called AIME (Accelerating Inclusion and Mitigating Emissions) tackles some of the thornier parts of climate change - and offers real hope. Indigenous people and other local communities control about 33 percent of forest tenure in Latin America. Their stewardship of these swaths of trees - which absorb the carbon emissions of our planet - is a vital tool in the fight against climate change. AIME is exploring the possibility of harnessing indigenous Life Plans to secure carbon finance for indigenous people and embedding indigenous conservation efforts in jurisdictional programs supported by global carbon finance.Supply chains and sustainability. Our demand for palm oil, soybeans, and beef is driving illegal deforestation around the world, but more and more companies are promising to deliver \"deforestation-free\" products. Supply-Change.org lets you see which companies are keeping their promises and which are not.Promotion of non-timber products from the forest. One way to keep forests intact is to make sure they're worth more alive than dead. That's what REDD aims to achieve, but we can also promote demand for sustainably-harvested non-timber forest products. The communities of indigenous people working to conserve their forests and generate alternative sources of income are a key part of controlling climate change, and such trade provides vital support for these communities.Biodiversity protection. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, agriculture impacts over 8,000 threatened species globally. The forestry sector impacts just under 8,000. A recent study looks at how to promote a solution called a \"four-step mitigation hierarchy\" to implement biodiversity protection in these sectors. The strategy seeks first to avoid impacts, then to minimize those impacts that are deemed unavoidable, then to restore the areas impacted, and finally to offset damages by restoring comparably habitat nearby.Earth Day remains relevant. This week, President Obama will celebrate Earth Day by heading to the Florida Everglades to talk about his administration's commitment to climate change mitigation. Brian Deese, senior advisor to the president, said, \"We're far beyond a debate about climate change's existence. We're focused on mitigating its very real effects here at home.\"Real solutions do exist, and maybe this will be the year we start paying attention to them."}]
