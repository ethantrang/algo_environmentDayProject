It's a hot-button issue this election season. Lots of politicians think that government has gotten too big and powerful and needs to be cut down to size. Others see government as an agent of good and argue for more governmental power. Apparently nowhere is the latter sentiment more alive than in the halls of the North Carolina Legislature. Most politicians work to legislate the laws of society; in North Carolina some politicians hope to legislate the laws of nature. If that ain't governmental power, I don't know what is.The story begins with sea-level rise along the North Carolina coast.Sea-Level Rise and North CarolinaThe greatest threat that climate change poses to North Carolina could very well be sea-level rise. Some 2,250 square miles of the state's broad, low-lying coastal plain (or twice the land mass of Rhode Island) lie at an elevation of just five feet (1.5 meter) or less above sea level. Much of both the Outer Banks and the coastal plain sandwiched between the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds lie at one meter or less. (See elevation map.)With sea level on the rise, the already tenuous system of bridges and roads linking the state's famed barrier islands to the mainland becomes even more imperiled and costly to maintain. Ultimately, sea-level rise could sound the death knell for much of the state's economic investments along the coast.In recognition of these facts, the North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission asked a science panel to study the problem and make recommendations. With plenty of caveats about uncertainties and such, the panel recommended [pdf] that \"a rise of 1 meter (39 inches) be adopted as the amount of anticipated rise by 2100, for policy development and planning purposes.\" (A summary of the panel's work and its reception by the State Legislature can be found here. Full report here [pdf].)The Battle Is Joined, Sea Level ... EnjoinedIt turns out that a projected sea-level rise of about one meter over the next 90 years or so is just plain unacceptable to certain North Carolinian factions. One such group, calling itself the NC-20 (for the 20 coastal counties its members supposedly hail from), is being driven, some have speculated, by coastal developers who fear that state and local policies based on such a rise in sea level would put the kibosh on their plans to build new condos, subdivisions, hotels, and the like.According to the group's website, NC-20 \"concentrate[s] primarily on actions to prevent regulation and rule making not based on science, to establish or maintain fairness in State funding (e.g. DOT), and to oppose predatory pricing in the areas of homeowners and dwelling insurance.\"Apparently, even though the findings of the panel were based on science, they crossed the line of acceptability for NC-20 and so the group decided to work to quash the science panel's report. Such efforts are proudly described in an NC-20 report [pdf] entitled \"Sea Level Rise: The Story from Beginning to End.\" It trumpets the group's \"substantial victory with over-zealous State bureaucrats who were attempting to impose a 39\" sea level rise planning mandate on all NC 20 counties.\"According to NC-20, once the dust settled, the Coastal Resources Commission dismissed the science panel's findings. As best as I can tell, this is not literally true but pretty close. The commission has not actually dismissed the science panel's report, per se. It has simply directed one of its committees to prepare a planning document based on the report but without any mention of accelerating sea-level rise.State Legislature Gets Into ActSo impressed with the ability of NC-20 to put an end to sea-level rise single-handedly, the North Carolina Senate decided to go one step further and legislate it away.Should this legislation come to fruition, North Carolina would be planning for a sea-level rise of about one foot rather than the scientifically projected three feet by the end of the century. That leaves a whole lot of water unaccounted for. And it could leave whole communities up coastal creeks paying for roads and bridges that no longer make sense to maintain in the face of rising seas.As of this writing, the jury's still out on the sea-level bill's fate. All this time I've been worrying about what will happen to my kids as a result of climate change. It was clear to me that we needed some really innovative, out-of-the-box solutions. Turns out we can just legislate it away. Big government to the rescue."}, {"title": "More Solar, Not Less", "text": "If you listen only to the propaganda machine of the Koch Brothers, the power companies and the \"clean coal\" industry, solar power is only desirable to a white rich ex-hippie with a Malibu beach house.Their latest tactic is to paint local clean energy, such as rooftop solar, as an elitist energy source that low-income Californians and people of color are subsidizing.Pitting the interests of low-income ratepayers and people of color in California against the solar industry and clean energy future is wrong and won't work. Ask the Texas oil companies that tried to pass Proposition 23 in 2010, which would have repealed the state's pioneering clean energy law, AB 32. Voters of color and residents from low-income communities overwhelmingly rejected that proposition because they understood that California's climate policies were good for their health and the economy.A 2011 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 79% of Asians, 83% of Blacks and 88% Latinos think that climate change is a serious threat to the economy and their quality of life. That same poll found that people of color believe more strongly than the general population that it is necessary to take steps immediately to counter the effects of climate change. People of color are the strongest supporters of a clean energy and climate change fighting agenda in California.When it's done right, low-income Californians and people of color have more to gain from the widespread adoption of local clean energy than anyone else. The more solar power that comes online, the faster we will be able to turn off the dirtiest power plants -- \"peaker\" plants -- which are the most polluting, least efficient and most expensive source of power we have.?Most \"peaker\" plants are located in our poorest communities. If there are subsidies that need to end, it's the subsidies to dirty energy producers and the heavy price poor Californians pay with their health as a result of last century's pollution based power system.Today, local clean energy like solar is making strong inroads in lower and middle-income communities. Innovative financing programs are changing the demographics of solar customers in California. According to the PV Solar Report, nearly two thirds of California home solar installations in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were in zip codes with median annual household incomes between $40,000 and $85,000 and not in the wealthiest areas of the state?Oakland-based Solar Mosaic is using creative, crowd-sourced financing to spread the benefits even further. Ultimately what is needed are incentives, which assure the availability of local clean energy in California's lowest income communities.Central to the move towards localized clean energy is a little-known policy called \"net metering.\" This policy, pioneered in California and now copied by 43 other states, is a simple billing arrangement that ensures solar customers receive fair credit for the electricity their systems generate. It operates like rollover minutes on a cell phone. When the customer doesn't use all the power from their rooftop solar panels, the extra energy is sent back onto the electric grid for the benefit of other customers. In turn, the solar customer owner gets credit on their electric bill. Today, there are over 100,000 rooftop solar energy systems in California and net metering is the policy responsible for 99% of them.The savings to regular folks is significant, which is why the utilities are so worried about this threat to their monopoly.With the Public Utilities Commission poised to boost the net metering program later this month, utilities are trying to make an end-run to halt their action in the Legislature. Lawmakers would be wise to reject that bill and support policies that expand clean energy for low and middle-income communities. One such bill is the \"Solar For All\" legislation introduced by Assemblymember Fong that provides further incentives for renewable energy in low-income communities.We have an opportunity to build a clean energy system that is good for all of California's residents, businesses and the planet. But to do so we need bold, holistic and comprehensive strategies that wean us off fossil fuels. The utilities' opposition to local clean energy, and in this case, to net metering, sends us in the wrong direction: backwards.Van Jones is author of the New York Times bestseller, The Green Collar Economy and Rebuild the Dream.

It might be smaller than you would imagine.The image above, from the USGS, shows all the world's water -- from bodies of water, glaciers, soil, water vapor and even living things -- in a sphere with a diameter of 860 miles. The volume of the sphere would equal 332.5 million cubic miles.The USGS explains that the sphere only appears small in relation to the entire Earth -- the diameter of the sphere is a bit larger than the distance between Salt Lake City and Topeka, Kansas.They notes that, according to one estimate, nearly 97 percent of Earth's water can be found in oceans, seas and bays while less than one percent can be found as freshwater in lakes, rivers or the ground.British researchers recently mapped the quantity and potential yield of all of Africa's groundwater, which may help improve access to clean water for the continent's residents. Scientists from the British Geological Survey and University College London estimate that Africa's groundwater totals over 158,000 cubic miles.The research comes as experts warn that increasing water scarcity is likely to contribute to political instability in Africa and elsewhere. John Kufuor, a former president of Ghana and current head of the Sanitation and Water for All partnership, told Bloomberg, \"People migrate to find water anywhere if there\u2019s a scarcity situation.

While representatives from the U.S. and eight other Pacific Rim countries met behind closed doors for the 12th round of negotiations for a massive new free trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, I was barred from negotiating sessions. I have never seen a single word of the draft TPP. And while roughly 600 corporate and 30-odd non-corporate trade advisers do have access to the text, federal law prohibits them from discussing specific contents of the TPP.The Sierra Club is deeply concerned about the environmental implications of the TPP. We understand and appreciate that U.S. negotiators are pushing for strong and enforceable standards in the environment chapter of the agreement, including binding language that would address environmental challenges such as illegal logging and overfishing. As these provisions are core to the work of the Sierra Club, we should be satisfied, right? Well, since the text is being kept from the public, we don't actually know the status or details of these proposals. And there are many other parts of the TPP that could directly undermine these very efforts to strengthen environmental protection while also putting the U.S. economy and workers at risk.Why is this \"21st century trade agreement,\" with such purported benefits, being hidden so jealously from the American public? Let's take a look at what they're hiding:1. Unfettered rights to corporations. Every indication is that the TPP will include provisions that give corporations the right to sue a government for unlimited cash compensation -- in private and not-transparent tribunals -- over any law or regulation that a corporation argues is hurting its expected future profits. Corporations have been quick to take advantage of such rights and have profited from them. Nearly $700 million in tax-payer dollars have been paid to corporations already, and about $12 billion in claims are pending. Tragically, dozens of cases attack common-sense environmental laws and regulations, such as regulations to protect communities and the environment from harmful chemicals or mining practices.   2. Increase in dirty fracking. The TPP may allow for significantly increased exports of liquefied natural gas without the careful study or adequate protections necessary to safeguard the American public. This would mean an increase of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the dirty and violent process that dislodges gas deposits from shale rock formations. It would also likely cause an increase in natural gas and electricity prices, impacting consumers, manufacturers, workers, and increasing the use of dirty coal power.3. Rollback of consumer rights. Just recently the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled against U.S. dolphin-safe tuna labels. The WTO found that these labels, which allow consumers to choose to buy tuna that was caught without using dolphin-killing fishing practices, discriminated against Mexican tuna fishers. The TPP, we understand, has provisions that would leave the door wide open to such outlandish cases which not only threaten our environment, but consumers' right to know and our government's right to regulate.4. Threats to American workers. While free trade agreements are often sold as job-creators, the evidence simply doesn't stack up. For example, the Economic Policy Institute has found that nearly 700,000 U.S. jobs were lost as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The TPP would likely give foreign corporations greater rights than domestic ones, providing an incentive for U.S. corporations to leave home and set up shop abroad. The TPP would also severely limit the U.S. government's ability to set policies that would boost our domestic economy, such as giving preference to American goods or American workers in government contracts.Many other areas of our everyday life, including access to affordable medicines, food safety, and internet freedom would also quite certainly be limited under the guide of \"free trade\" in the TPP. And if I've got any of this wrong, I invite someone to prove me wrong.

Good ones draw people in with their inspired plates and atmosphere-performance art meets flavor. While deliciousness at a restaurant is first and foremost, more patrons are now also making decisions about where to eat based on the values behind the food-like social justice for the workers, healthy growing practices, and support for local economies.Last week in an interview with the New York Times, chefs Thomas Keller -- who has received many awards for his creative approach to food at restaurants French Laundry and the Bouchon empire -- and Andoni Luis Aduriz, of the restaurant Mugaritz in Spain, took the Damien Hirst approach to feeding people: It's about the experience and whatever it takes to create radical and inspiring food is more important than the potential impact on the environment. \"With the relatively small number of people I feed, is it really my responsibility to worry about carbon footprint?\" remarked Keller.Both chefs admitted that they buy local when they can, but didn't want to focus on that as a practice. According to Aduriz, \"To align yourself entirely with the idea of sustainability makes chefs complacent and limited.\"The good food movement would beg to differ. The proliferation of farm-to-table restaurants, farmers' markets and small food businesses, and the increased visibility of food policy issues in the media all speak to a sea change under way.Keller and Aduriz seem like dinosaurs when you compare them to younger chefs like Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, for example, who is proving that taking a local, values-driven approach to food can be inspiring, delicious and award-worthy. All three chefs' restaurants are featured on the \"World's 50 Best Restaurants\" list, but Noma is number one.While the list is not at the heart of discussions around food, the chefs that appear there do wield an influence far beyond the people they feed day in and day out at their restaurants. As the article in the Times points out, \"While their restaurants may be accessible only to the world's 0.1 percent, chefs at top restaurants influence the entire global food community with the way they think, write, tweet, and talk about food -- not just the way they cook it.\"This is not the first time Keller has made the case for quality above values. Only now, it sounds even staler than the day-old bread at Bouchon Bakery.Food preparation can be a creative pursuit, but at the end of the day, chefs are just feeding people. They create an experience of flavor, but the results end up in someone's stomach. And in requiring an agricultural product for their creations, a chef is reliant on nature's whims in a way that most artists are not. This is why the locavore movement is not a trend easily dismissed, but part of a greater paradigm shift around how we view and value resources.While reactions to the Times story continued on Twitter, scientists, advocates and food policy media gathered last week at the Monterey Bay Aquarium for the annual Sustainable Foods Institute, part of Cooking for Solutions. The purpose of the event, according to aquarium Executive Director Julie Packard, is to explore \"how the food choices we make affect the health of our soil, water, and oceans.\"In contrast to the antiquated remarks put forth by Keller and Aduriz, James Beard Award winner and owner and chef of the restaurant Dressing Room in Westport, CT, Michel Nischan, was present to be honored as Chef of the Year. He is also known for his work as President and CEO of Wholesome Wave, an organization that seeks to increase access to healthy food. They have had huge success to date through doubling the value of SNAP-food stamps-used at farmers' markets, resulting in $1 million more spent on produce in 2010.While not every chef feels inspired to use his celebrity and time to start an organization to help people who would probably never set foot in their restaurant, Nischan couldn't be more in line with the food Zeitgeist. A growing number of chefs are now taking part in the evolving conversation on how we value food.Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli of the restaurant Butter in New York City remarked last week on a panel focused on food waste that, \"Chefs can convince people to eat things that they don't know about or normally prize.\" She was eager for people to eat sardines and other forage fish, saying, \"Let's just stop eating tuna for 300 years.\"As a presentation at Cooking for Solutions by Jonathan Foley, Director of the Institute of the Environment at the University of Minnesota, demonstrated, chefs ignore the sustainability of their sources at their own peril.\"We're running out of everything,\" said Foley. \"Agriculture uses up a planet's worth of land, a planet's worth of water and agriculture is the single biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. If you want to solve climate change you absolutely have to address agriculture and its emissions. It's huge.\"Fixing this issue will require us to look beyond the next plate. Many great artists have produced world-renowned work within constraints. Similarly, chefs face a problem of resource scarcity that demands their creativity.Originally published on Civil Eats."}, {"title": "Field Notes on Food Justice: Why Your Local Grocery Store Makes Farmworkers Poor", "text": "\"Fresh and Fair from Florida\"...Five words that would look so beautiful stamped on your next tomato purchase.Five words that would signify a revolution in agricultural working conditions.Five words that today remain tantalizingly just out of reach, even with two decades of tireless organizing by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) and our allies and, most recently, several years of unprecedented victories. With the victories, of course, has come increased recognition of the CIW and its work. One such honor that we are most proud of, and humbled by, is being recognized as the first-ever Food Justice Winner for this year's Natural Resources Defense Council's Growing Green Awards.But more importantly, these recent victories have begun to shine a spotlight on the value and meaning of fair food, and on the workers without whose who labor and input that term has no meaning, and on the CIW's Fair Food Program, implemented this season on over 90 percent of Florida's tomato fields. We now know that the day when we can certify Florida tomatoes as the fairest in the world is not far off, and the Fair Food Program is mapping the path for getting there.Let's back up a bit and share a little about the CIW and the environment in which its members toil before we get to what lies ahead.The CIW is a worker-led human rights organization based in the farmworker community of Immokalee, the heart of Florida's (and the nation's) $600 million fresh tomato industry.The CIW and its more than 5,000 members spearhead the Campaign for Fair Food, the national collaboration of consumers and workers designed to harness the purchasing power of the country's largest food retail corporations to improve the lives of the farmworkers who harvest the tomatoes they sell. To date, ten retail food corporations have signed binding agreements to participate in the Fair Food Program, including McDonalds, Subway, Burger King, Sodexo, Aramark, Compass Group, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's.According to the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange (FTGE), \"Florida produces virtually all the fresh-market, field-grown tomatoes in the U.S. from October through June each year, and accounts for about 50 percent of all fresh tomatoes produced domestically.\"Farm labor remains among the worst-paid, least-protected jobs in the country. Farmworkers face a daunting combination of back-breaking, hot, dangerous labor with sub-poverty wages (according to the USDOL, farmworkers earn between $10,000-$12,000 per year), few or no benefits or fundamental labor rights (farmworkers are excluded from the right to overtime pay and to bargain collectively, for example), no job security and a high rate of labor rights abuse (sexual harassment and systemic minimum wage violations remain prevalent in the industry). \"Home\" is too often a dilapidated two-bedroom trailer, well past any rational expiration date, that is shared with numerous other workers.CIW's Campaign for Fair Food begins from this simple premise: If we can diagnose what makes farmworkers poor -- the forces that result in farmworker exploitation -- then we can redirect those forces in ways that reduce farmworker poverty. In Immokalee, we realized years ago that the volume purchasing practices of today's retail food giants, massive multi-billion dollar companies that didn't exist a generation ago, create a tremendous downward pressure on produce prices at the farm level. That downward pressure is passed on to farmworkers -- the weakest link in the food supply chain -- in the form of ever lower wages.In other words, your local grocery store makes farmworkers poor. But not just your store, all the food industry giants, from Kroger to Stop & Shop, Publix to Safeway, that enhance their profits year after year from pricing policies that drive farmworker poverty and exploitation.In the words of a Swahili proverb, \"when the elephants fight, the grass suffers.\" It isn't that the retail chains set out to impoverish farmworkers. It's just that in the regular course of competing against each other for market dominance, they fight for the lowest prices possible from their suppliers, and our nation's two to three million farmworkers ultimately pay the price.But if the market is the problem, then the market can also be the solution. The Fair Food Program seeks to reverse the process that now exploits farmworkers, by requiring buyers to send pennies per pound of tomato purchases back down the supply chain to increase farmworker wages and to leverage their overwhelming purchasing power to demand more modern working conditions from their Florida suppliers.Of course, changing the market also means changing the demands consumers make on the retail chains. By creating a new demand for the fair treatment of farmworkers, consumers and the CIW have moved participating buyers to commit to purchasing only from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct, the most progressive code of conduct in the produce industry today. This has changed the market incentives facing growers at the bottom of the supply chain, which in turn elevates the day-to-day working environment of farmworkers in the fields.The theory of change behind the Campaign for Fair Food has been shown to work. With protests that began a decade ago in front of Taco Bell's headquarters outside Los Angeles, California, the CIW has managed to change wages and working conditions in the fields outside of Immokalee, Florida.And so, after twenty years of organizing, today we have a strong national network of consumers pressuring retail food corporations to support the Fair Food principles, a growing mass of buyers committed to the Fair Food Program, over 90 percent of Florida tomato growers signed on to the Fair Food Code of Conduct, and an organized, mobilized work force ready to do its part to enforce the new standards. We're strides closer to labeling tomatoes with those five beautiful words -- \"Fresh and Fair from Florida.\"However, for two key reasons, it is still not quite time to start ordering those labels.First, the degree of change that we are able to make in the fields is directly dependent on the number of retail giants participating in the Fair Food Program. More participating buyers means more change, in both wages and working conditions. The penny-per-pound bonus that workers are receiving on their weekly paychecks today depends on the number of pounds purchased under our Fair Food Agreements; every pound the participating buyers purchase is accompanied by a surcharge that goes to increase workers wages, but there are many more companies out there -- Publix, Kroger, Stop & Shop, and Giant among them -- who are still buying their Florida tomatoes the old way, \"no questions asked.\" To realize the full potential of the wage increase promised by the Fair Food Program, all the major buyers must do their part.Second, the hard work of implementing the Fair Food Code of Conduct takes time. Codes of conduct, if not enforced, are nothing more than words on paper. That fact is not lost on the corporations that use their supplier codes of conduct as cost-free tools for damage control when faced with accusations of abuse in their supply chains. But enforcement of a code of conduct is expensive, hard, time-consuming work. That is why so few corporations are interested in doing it and why so few social auditing enterprises are able to effectively monitor.Of course, the Fair Food Code of Conduct is just a set of standards, too, although one developed by farmworkers themselves, in conjunction with buyers and growers, that improves farmworkers wages and working conditions well beyond the current requirements of law. The critical difference in the Fair Food Program, however, is that the CIW, a worker-led organization, is a constant presence doing whatever it takes to enforce the code. And it takes a lot. The day-to-day, field-to-field, worker-to-worker job of implementing the CIW's agreements has just begun. Years of neglect have left behind a stubborn residue of bad farm bosses, abusive labor practices, fear and mistrust in Florida agriculture that must be scrubbed away before any kind of credible claim of fairness is possible.But the cleansing process is well underway. Through the Fair Food Program, the CIW has put together all the tools necessary to strip away the abuses of the past. Today, the Fair Food Standards Council, a third-party monitoring organization, is up and running, auditing the farms where the Code of Conduct is in effect, tracking the penny-per-pound payments from buyers to growers to workers, and investigating and resolving complaints as they come in from over 30,000 workers across the industry. Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct will ultimately cost a grower the business of all the participating buyers, as that is an element of the Fair Food Agreement that each buyer has signed with the CIW.At the same time, the CIW is crisscrossing the state to do worker-to-worker education, on the farm and on the clock, to ensure that the workers themselves understand not only their rights under the program, but also that they, as the ever-present eyes and ears in the fields, are an indispensible part of its ultimate success.All of this takes time, hard work, and collective commitment. And as the saying goes in Spanish, it is not something done \"de la noche a la manana\" (overnight). Winning NRDC's Food Justice Award will hopefully help take the Campaign for Fair Food and the Fair Food Program to the next level, so that we can turn the dream of branding a truly fair tomato into a reality.Your support for more humane working conditions for farmworkers in Florida's fields and beyond is more important than ever; both today, in taking action to convince more retail food corporations to support the Fair Food principles, and tomorrow, in supporting these principles when a labeled, certified fair tomato finally makes it to your local grocery store."}, {"title": "U.S. Navy Green Energy Plans Threatened By Republican Biofuel Ban", "text": "From Earth Techling's Pete Danko:The U.S. military\u2019s embrace of alternative energy seems to drive a segment of the public crazy \u2013 witness the many vituperative comments to this story about a hybrid ground combat vehicle under development by the Army.

Instead, they\u2019re focused on the alt fuels, the heart of the Great Green Fleet effort, under which the Navy seeks to deploy a fleet powered entirely by alternative fuels by 2016 on its way to reaching 50 percent alternative energy use overall by 2020.South San Francisco-based Solazyme, which ferments algae to produce oil that can be refined into fuel, is one of two big players in the Navy\u2019s biofuels program. The other is Louisiana-based Dynamic Fuels, a Tyson Foods-Syntroleum joint venture that makes its fuel from used cooking oil and non-food-grade animal fats. Last December the Navy said it will pay $12 million to purchase a total of 450,000 gallons of biofuels from the companies to help power a carrier group during big maritime exercises this summer.The biofuels do come at a hefty cost. Based on the $12 million purchase price for 450,000 gallons, the Navy is paying north of $26 per gallon for the biofuel \u2013 more than eight times the approximately $3 per gallon that petroleum-based jet fuel is going for these days.

Her time is stretched thin between work and her kids' soccer games -- and navigating the array of toxic chemicals that fill her family's world.\"I do my best, but it's just not easy to know which mattress to buy, or how far from flame retardants you can get, or what food wrapped in plastic packaging is okay,\" she said.On Tuesday, Nienstedt and her 11-year-old daughter, Tyler Cheyenne, joined about 200 other moms and children as part of the National Stroller Brigade in Washington, D.C. Their mission: convince Congress to retire the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act and replace it with the proposed Safe Chemicals Act, which currently awaits a Senate vote.The swap would essentially shift the burden of proof for chemical safety from the current assumption that a chemical is safe until proven toxic -- generally after it has already spent years on the market -- to a requirement for industry to prove that a chemical is safe prior to placing it on store shelves.\"To me, the idea of testing chemicals before they are allowed to be used is common sense. We should have had that in place decades ago,\" Nienstedt said.Evidence has been mounting that exposure to environmental chemicals, particularly while in the womb and during early childhood, can lead to health problems throughout life -- possibly even into future generations.Just this Monday, a study was published suggesting that nearly a quarter of U.S. teens now have diabetes or pre-diabetes. That's up from 9 percent a decade ago. While there might be other possible contributions to the rise, recent research hints at the potential role of exposures to bisphenol-A and phthalates.Autism, cancer, obesity and asthma are also on the list of conditions thought to be both increasingly common among children and associated with kids touching, eating or breathing toxic chemicals.The new act, introduced by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) in April 2011, would regulate both new chemicals coming on to the market as well as the existing inventory of chemicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would be tasked with first addressing chemicals already suspected to be toxic and those that are particularly pervasive, regardless of what's known about them to date.\"The stroller brigade is carrying an important message to Congress that we're not going to stand by and let our kids continue to be exposed to chemicals that make them sick,\" Lautenberg, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health, said in a statement. \"Concerned moms are the best weapons we have in this fight. With their help, I will keep advancing the Safe Chemicals Act to reform our broken toxic chemical laws and provide a healthier future for our families.\"Representatives of industry, however, don't think that Lautenberg's proposal is the best means to modernize the country's regulation of chemicals. \"We will continue to work with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to create a feasible science-based solution that will give consumers confidence that chemicals are being used safely and foster innovation and job creation in the U.S.,\" the American Chemistry Council, a lobbying group, said in a statement in response to Tuesday's event.Receiving perhaps the most attention lately are flame retardants. Over the last couple of weeks, the Chicago Tribune has exposed the deceptive campaigns of Big Tobacco and chemical manufacturers that led to the proliferation of this known carcinogen in couches, chairs, nursing pillows and strollers, among other products. In a recent study, toxic flame retardants were found in 80 percent of tested products for babies and children. The most common: chlorinated Tris, which was actually banned from children's pajamas in the 1970s due to toxicity concerns.\"Somehow chemicals phased out of kid's pajamas wound their way into everything else that we hold up close to baby,\" Andy Igrejas, director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, told The Huffington Post.\"The current system amounts to an honor system,\" Igrejas said. \"Chemicals get on the market without any health or safety data. And once on the market it can be used for anything, even without disclosing that chemical's presence in a product.\"Bottom line, there can be no honor system when we've shown companies have no honor,\" he added.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found traces of 212 industrial chemicals in the blood and urine of Americans. Several of these chemicals are known to cause cancer, birth defects and other health problems.Children's health advocates fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg, given that only 200 of the 80,000 chemicals available for industry use have been tested for any toxic threats. Tracey Woodruff, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said she thinks the chemical industry should have the same kinds of laws as the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to toxic chemicals. \"We don't think it's strange to ask for the safety information of a drug before it's prescribed,\" she said.\"We want to tell Congress to stop waiting to protect children from toxic chemical exposures,\" added Maureen Swanson, a mom from Pittsburgh who participated in the brigade and directs the Healthy Children Project for the Learning Disabilities Association of America. \"We've waited too long already.\"With her second child, Mariah, she says that she is much more conscious of possible exposures. \"I don't use plastics in cooking and I buy locally grown and organic produce, to the extent that I can,\" she said.But like Nienstedt, Swanson said she is frustrated by the lack of information, and therefore control, over exposures. \"Labels don't tell you what chemicals are in a product,\" she said. \"Furniture that has flame retardants is almost impossible to avoid.\"The proposed law would also make this information more transparent for consumers.\"Parents take a lot of responsibility for keeping their kids safe,\" Swanson said. \"But we can't do it alone.\""}, {"title": "'Harry Potter' Fans Abandoning Pet Owls Following End Of Series", "text": "Animal sanctuaries in England are caring for hundreds of pet owls that were abandoned by their owners in the past year, a disturbing trend rescuers believe is linked to the end of the \"Harry Potter\" series.\"Harry Potter\" fans enchanted with the boy wizard's owl sidekick Hedwig drove up demand for the birds during book and movie releases, the Mirror reports. But now that all book installments and film adaptations have been released, many owners are abandoning their pet owls into the wild, where they are unprepared to care for themselves.\"Before the films were out I had six owls, now it's 100. It\u2019s all down to \u00adHarry Potter,\" Pam Toothill, a rescue workers at the Owlcenter sanctuary in Corwen, North Wales, told the paper. \"People saw \u00adHarry\u2019s owl in the movies and thought how cute and cuddly they looked. Now they are bored and fed-up with all the work involved looking after an owl.\"Toothill said that in order to properly to care for owls, owners need to purchase a 20-ft. aviary, which can easily cost more than $1,000. Unfortunately, many unprepared pet owners have kept birds in apartments with limited space -- one owl Toothill rescued had been living in a man's bedroom.\"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling has pleaded with fans to sponsor an owl that needs help rather than trying to take one in as a pet, according to the Suffolk Owl Sanctuary.\"If anybody has been influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house, I would like to take this opportunity to say as forcefully as I can, 'you are wrong,'\" Rowling said.But if past cases of fan-fueled animal crazes are any indication, people are often undeterred by such advice. When Disney released the live-action film '101 Dalmatians' in 1996, animals rights advocates worked tirelessly to educate prospective pet owners about the breed in order to prevent disastrous adoptions.Unfortunately, the film's popularity fueled thousands of Dalmatian puppy adoptions that owners later regretted, and shelters were soon overflowing with unwanted dogs, The New York Times reported in 1997.Years earlier, thousands of pet turtles met a similar fate after fans of the animated \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" TV series grew tired of their newly-adopted pets, according to Change.org. Many dumped their turtles in ponds or lakes, where they began to reproduce and outcompete indigenous species of turtles for food.Pat Morrison, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that L.A.-area animal shelters see a rise in pet abandonments whenever a popular animal movie is released. The movie \"Babe\" spurred unwise pig adoptions, and the movies \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" and \"Marmaduke\" caused similar upswings in failed adoptions for Chihuahas and Great Danes.\"Every time a cute-dog or cute-cat movie comes out, 5% of the box office take \u2013- gross, not net; I have lived here long enough to know about Hollywood accounting \u2013- should go to animal shelters to take care of these bought-and-abandoned \"fad dogs,\" Morrison wrote."}, {"title": "The Bottom Line: A Short Season for Big Fish", "text": "This year's purse-seine fishing for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean Sea kicked off this week, but don't blink or you might miss it.On Tuesday, May 15, large commercial purse-seine vessels with massive nets set out to catch literally tons of tuna by encircling entire schools of breeding bluefin. The season officially ends June 15, but if the recent past is any indicator, the season will close sooner than that. After years of overfishing and a decline in the bluefin population, catch limits were finally set at scientifically recommended levels in 2010. These new limits are good for the bluefin, because they are much lower than those previously set. As a result, in the past two years, several countries have met their quotas before the end of the monthlong season, catching all of their allocated tuna in just one or two weeks.Although the season may last less than a month, this is no small-scale fishery. In the coming weeks, millions of pounds of bluefin will be captured by purse-seine boats, which will be worth millions of dollars on the global market. The majority of these fish will be transferred to cages in the sea, known as ranches, around the Mediterranean, where they will be fed and fattened until they are ready to be sold. Proper operation and control of such a large and valuable fishery depends on having an accurate, real-time count of the fish that are caught and transferred to ranches so officials can ensure that quotas are not exceeded during the frantic rush to fish.Fortunately, this is the last year that bluefin catches will be tracked by an outdated paper-based system. In November 2011, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the group of 74 countries that manages bluefin fishing in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean, committed to developing and implementing an electronic tracking system that will address many of the deficiencies of the current method. The electronic bluefin catch documentation program will allow fishermen to enter their catches in a central database in real time on the Internet so that authorities can get an up-to-the-minute accounting of the catch and close the fishery before official limits are exceeded. The electronic tracing also will help reduce fraud and will deter illegal fishing by requiring verification along each step of the supply chain, from sea to plate.Several governments have volunteered to test the new system this fall, including the European Union, Japan, and Turkey, before it is fully implemented throughout the fishery in May 2013. This is a good start, but to ensure a robust testing environment with geographic and gear diversity, more countries need to commit to be a part of this pilot program. In particular, the United States should volunteer to test the system on the western population of bluefin in the Gulf of Mexico.It is an important time for bluefin. With the Mediterranean purse-seine fishing season already under way, a tracking system being tested this fall, and new annual quotas being set at the next ICCAT meeting in November, there is an opportunity to finally address some of the decades-old failures of bluefin tuna management. Current fishing quotas must not be increased until enforcement and monitoring are strengthened, the science behind bluefin stock assessments is improved, and there is evidence of improvement in the species' status. In future posts, I'll be sure to update you on the latest news and happenings and also to let you know what you can do to help guarantee a sustainable future for bluefin on both sides of the Atlantic."}, {"title": "Corexit Maker Nalco Gets Louisiana Credits For Plant", "text": "This article was published in The Louisiana Weekly in the May 21, 2012 edition.Nalco Company, the maker of Corexit used to disperse oil from the BP spill, is using Louisiana state credits to build an $18.7 million polymer facility at its Garyville plant -- 35 miles upriver from New Orleans. Critics of that early May announcement wonder why the state continues to subsidize petrochemical plants and why Illinois-based Nalco is being given incentives when cleanup workers in Louisiana are suffering from Corexit sprayed in mid-2010 and later.The dry-polymer unit will be part of Nalco's 42-year-old complex, making water-treatment chemicals, in St. John the Baptist Parish. The parish's biggest industry is its ten petrochemical plants and oil refineries. Nalco, a unit of Minnesota-based Ecolab, expects to add 22 jobs to its Garyville staff of 235 and to create the equivalent of 167 temporary construction jobs. Louisiana Economic Development officials said as an incentive, Nalco will use the state's Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs incentive programs.Ground was broken last fall and the unit should be finished late this year. Nalco is awarding all ten of the project's construction contracts to Louisiana companies but that doesn't mean the workers they hire will necessarily be state residents. The new 300,000-square-foot facility will expand the complex, which is already Nalco's biggest plant, to one million square feet.Customers for Nalco's dry polymers are expected to include plants along the river owned by other companies who need the products for water treatment.Last week, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Stephen Moret said \"the state's Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs provide incentives that are available to any company meeting the eligibility criteria.\" Under the tax exemption program, no property taxes have to be paid on improvements -- new facilities and equipment -- for 10 years. And the quality jobs program gives Nalco an annual, 5-to-6-percent rebate on eligible, new payroll for 10 years.\"The actual value of these incentives for Nalco will depend on their final capital investment and payroll numbers,\" Moret said.What's wrong with the state helping Nalco? A lot, said Daniel Becnel, Jr., a long-time resident of St. John the Baptist Parish and an attorney representing BP spill victims. For starters, petrochemical plants don't need subsidies and credits to locate in Southeast Louisiana. \"They want to be here because of navigation and infrastructure and since few other states or communities will let them in,\" he said.From his office in Reserve, La., Becnel said \"we've got the river, entry to the Gulf, a full rail network, along with cheap natural gas, land and labor, and very little cold weather. Our pollution laws aren't strictly enforced.\"Becnel continued \"this used to be plantation country but agriculture is disappearing and the land here sells very cheaply.\" Antebellum mansions coexist with plants along the river. \"The river suits these plants because they need water for steam and cooling,\" he said. Marathon Petroleum Co. is seeking a state permit now to expand crude oil output at its Garyville refinery.Many states shun petrochemical plants -- especially near urban areas -- because they release toxic chemicals into the air, and can catch fire and pollute water. \"New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, California and most states don't want these plants,\" Becnel said.Meanwhile, droves of people were exposed to BP's oil and Nalco's Corexit in 2010, based on an estimated 90,000 cleanup workers and 105,000 Gulf Coast residents eligible to participate in the medical portion of the likely, $8.7 billion settlement against BP. Settlement documents have been fied in U.S. District Court in New Orleans.In early April, Daniel Becnel objected to a motion by plaintiff attorneys in the BP settlement to dismiss Nalco from that litigation.Becnel, who has already settled claims against BP for thousands of fishermen, seafood companies and property owners, also represents 3,500 cleanup workers. He filed a class action suit on April 17, seeking damages from BP and Nalco for cleanup workers who suffer medical problems. The case is Jarod Elrod et al. v. BP Exploration & Production Inc. et al, and Becnel intends to try it in court.After local cleanup workers suffered from exposure to dispersants, should Corexit's maker be subsidized by the state? Coastal advocate Sherri Foytlin, the wife of an oil worker and mother of six, said \"Nalco has shown no social responsibility to cleanup workers. It took a lawsuit from Earthjustice to find out what was in the Corexit sprayed on the water, the coast and on us.\" She lives in Rayne, an oil workers' town in Acadia Parish.A year after environmental law firm Earthjustice sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in mid-2010, the feds released the components of Corexit 9500 and Corexit 9527--produced by Nalco and used in the BP spill. Dispersants, which break oil into droplets and move them from the sea surface and into the water column, also contain chemicals linked to cancer and other illnesses, Foytlin noted. Cleanup workers, coastal residents and marine life were all hurt by Corexit, she said.But Foytlin said \"there's a big ravine, a big gap in understanding among the leaders in Baton Rouge about the threats that south Louisiana residents face from chemicals and from petrochemical plants. State Senator Crowe has tried to raise awareness about the dangers of Corexit in the Louisiana legislature but the lobbyists are in charge and they win the day.\" In May of last year, a Louisiana Senate committee approved Slidell legislator A.G. Crowe's proposal to ban dispersants to fight spills in Louisiana waters -- which extend three miles into the Gulf. Little has happened with the bill, however, and Foytlin predicts \"oil companies will continue to use dispersants in spills here.\"BP used 1.9 million gallons of Corexit to remove at least some of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude the gushed from its Macondo well in 2010. The capped well is 52 miles southeast of Venice, La.The amount of Corexit spraying and its underwater use in BP's spill were unprecedented. And that's even though years before the spill, in 2001, the EPA and Swedish scientists had evidence that Corexit mixed with oil was much more toxic to aquatic life than oil itself. The UK, where BP is headquartered, banned Corexit in 1998.In June 2010, with the BP spill in progresss, Louisiana oystermen sued Nalco and BP -- accusing them of permanently altering the seabed and food chain.The spill is the latest chapter in Louisiana's dependence on industries that threaten human health, critics say. \"Many of us here in St. John the Baptist Parish are ill because of all these plants and refineries,\" Becnel said. \"But I stay because I've always lived here.\"As for Nalco's Garyville plant, it seems to have cleaned up its act after violations nine and ten years ago. In March 2007, Nalco paid the Louisiana Dept. of Environmental Quality $50,000 in a settlement over improper storage in 2002 and 2003 of materials, including hazardous waste, and over an illegal wastewater discharge in 2003, according to Tim Beckstrom, DEQ spokesman. \"No major concerns have been noted at the facility since,\" he said last week.In a misstep blamed on the nation's weak economy in 2009, Nalco's Garyville plant was stuck with surplus, finished products with expired shelf lives, and sent them to landfill, Ecolab spokesman Roman Blahoski said last week. The DEQ said Nalco had to send acrylic polymer to a class I landfill in Sorrento, La. from 2008 to 2009.More recently, the Garyville plant's record includes safety and pollution-prevention awards from the Louisiana Chemical Association and the DEQ.Nonetheless, many south Louisiana residents want to see fresh thinking about industry from lawmakers. \"Other Southern states give tax credits and subsidies but they attract big factories that, for instance, make cars and employ thousands of workers,\" Becnel said. Hyundai in 2005 opened an Alabama plant that has 2,000 employees and is hiring 900 more now. Toyota opened a Blue Spring, Miss. plant last year, creating 1,500 jobs.  A drive through Louisiana's River Parishes to view plantations and trace ancestors can be jarring because of the many plants and refineries plunked down in that country setting. Petro-chemical facilities exist near Louisiana's beaches, too.Foytlin said \"the state should try to attract clean, sustainable industries, and could outfit hundreds of old oil rigs in the Gulf with wind turbines, or could use turbines to create energy from river currents. But instead we're living in cancer clusters. I attribute it to an extreme lack of vision among the leaders in Baton Rouge.\"If you're wondering where Corexit is made, Nalco said last week it isn't manufactured in Garyville and wouldn't reveal where it is produced."}, {"title": "How to Sell an Electric Car", "text": "Imagine you could buy an electric car for the same price as an equivalent internal combustion model. Along with the car came a six-year recharging package, which for $150/month guaranteed you unlimited charging privileges and driving. (If you drive an average 15,000 miles each year, and get 25 true MPG in your gas model, this recharging contract is equivalent to gasoline at $3/gallon!)In innovative industries this would not be a revolutionary business model -- it's how you buy a cell phone. The service contract pays for the bells and whistles on your new Droid or iPhone. Cell companies know that customers care most about upfront costs, and mostly don't like to lease -- so, in effect, the service contract is a proxy lease. The recharging package I just suggested for an electric vehicle is, in effect, a lease on the batteries which make the EV more expensive up-front.But in the slow and sluggish world of cars, where even setting fixed prices for a new car has been a bridge too far, this kind of financial innovation is proving a hard sell. That's dangerous for American leadership in EV's and for the climate.Overall, the world's biggest challenge in moving clean energy solutions is simple: they cost more up front, but cost less to operate over time because the fuel is free or very cheap. Energy efficiency solutions actually offer negative operating costs. But consumers, as opposed to businesses, have a high preference for products which are cheap at the front end. Consumers almost never come close even to taking life-cycle costs into account. One way to get them to do so is to limit their choices by requiring manufacturers to meet minimal efficiency requirements -- but that still leaves the dilemma that whenever there is a choice, consumers will migrate to the cheapest option at the point of purchase, not over the life-cycle of the product. So we can easily remain stuck with polluting, climate destroying dangerous fossil fuels -- even when clean energy would be cheaper -- because of consumer's focus on purchase price.This is particularly true of electric vehicles, where selling lots of them is the key to getting their price down. It's not going to happen, at least in the US, fast enough, without some additional market push. (In fact, at present production volumes auto companies couldn't actually afford the deal I propose at the start today -- it would take more like a $200/month recharging contract, equivalent of gas at $4/gallon. But if they were selling 50,000 of an EV model my $150/month-$3/gallon deal is within reach.)If American automakers don't start linking business model innovations to the technical creativity that underlies a Chevy Volt or the new Ford Focus EV, there is a real risk that in spite of the US technological leadership, we could lose the electric vehicle race. That's because the US faces some significant competitive disadvantages in electrification compared to, say, France. France has much more expensive gasoline ($8 gallon). Its nighttime electricity rates are unbelievably cheap, because its over-reliance on 24-hour nuclear power leaves it with surplus 2AM electrons -- lots of them. And a larger proportion of French driving is at short distances where EV range is not an issue. One cannot conceive the new French administration of Francois Hollande finding it ideologically offensive to arrange a partnership between the largely state-owned  Electricite de France and a French auto company, even if the French government had to provide -- shock! -- loan guarantees or other financial support to jump-start a massive increase in the French EV market. (In fact, his conservative predecessor, Nicholas Sarkozy, made a $550 million down payment on such a partnership four years ago.)A veteran leader in the environmental movement, Carl Pope is the former executive director and chairman of the Sierra Club. Mr. Pope is co-author -- along with Paul Rauber -- of Strategic Ignorance: Why the Bush Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a Century of Environmental Progress, which the New York Review of Books called \"a splendidly fierce book.\""}, {"title": "The Environment Is Dead: Long Live Mother Nature", "text": "\"Environmentalism has failed\" is a statement that deserves attention. It comes from famed environmentalist David Suzuki marking 50 years since Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, widely regarded as having sparked the environmental movement.Suzuki's May 2, 2012 blog (The Huffington Post, rabble.ca) on the fundamental failure of environmentalism is ominous. The world faces not only environmental calamities such as deforestation, coral reef depletion, and freshwater shortages, it is also mired in economic crises and harsh political realities. Despite the promise of \"Arab Springs\" and the global Occupy movement, we are increasingly in planetary peril. Throughout his life, David Suzuki has been a leading educator on planetary health; his conclusion about the environmental movement's failure must be agonizing. Perhaps that's why his blog offered no new way forward.What now?As a longtime troubadour and ecology advocate, in word and song I've celebrated this bountiful planet and our place in the family of all life. Besides my eco-awareness songs for kids beginning with \"Baby Beluga\" in 1980, ten years later I also recorded an ecology album, Evergreen Everblue. I've worked with kids of all ages, attended environmental conferences, and met with leading campaigners such as climatologist James Hansen and Green Party leader and MP Elizabeth May, as well as with eminent thinkers across a number of disciplines. I feel a responsibility to briefly address the key questions this sobering moment holds.What caused the failure?Primary among the many factors that can be cited is the growth of corporate concentration, power and dominance. This in part may explain the gridlock among nations when it comes to concerted eco-progress. Perhaps it's also been a failure of imagination and language.The environmental movement failed to change the way we look at the world and our place in it. Even after the 1970 NASA portrait of Earth from space, we didn't learn to feel our interconnectedness and belonging on this planet, third from the sun.Nature became \"the environment\": a reductionist term devoid of relationship. The grandeur of Gaia thus reduced and objectified separated us from our Earth Mother. And environmentalism itself became divisive. While environmentalists struggled mightily to save this species/habitat and protect that, activist hubris pitted \"environmentalists\" against those who were not.Environmental challenges were hard to ignore. In 1989 in Vancouver I heard Stephen Lewis say that if China and India were to use coal to fuel their exploding economies in the 1990s, what the rest of the world did in carbon reduction wouldn't matter. He was right. Ten years later, United Nations Environment Programme's GEO 2000 Report decried not only a lack of overall progress in environmental protection but also the loss of ground in the 1990s, which UNEP had dubbed \"the turnaround decade.\" That news pained me as much as discovering in 1989 that St. Lawrence River belugas were riddled with toxins at levels found in hazardous waste sites. Or learning in the mid '90s that human breast milk was contaminated with trace amounts of PCBs and dioxins, among the most of lethal poisons. Belugas and breast milk were new canaries in the coal mine.A word about language: in the press release for GEO 2000, the landmark UNEP report described as \"the most authoritative assessment ever of the environmental crisis facing humanity in the new millennium,\" the fragmented language is in direct contradiction to the report's stated aim of integration, synthesis:...full scale emergencies now exist in a number of fields. \"The environment remains largely outside the mainstream of everyday human consciousness and is still considered an add-on to the fabric of life, says GEO 2000. Furthermore, \"Despite successes on various fronts, time for a rational, well-planned transition to a sustainable system is running out fast,\" says Klaus T\u00f6pfer, UNEP's Executive Director. \"In some areas, it has already run out. In others, new problems are emerging which compound already difficult situations. [italics mine.]The failure of words is as simple as it is stunning. To make the very point that \"the environment\" remains separate from everyday life, why use that same barren term? That environmentalists still make that linguistic faux pas, seemingly oblivious to the irony, is truly baffling.Small wonder that what has not changed is precisely what must change: \"everyday human consciousness.\"What do environmental organizations and their supporters do now?Well staffed large membership eco-NGO's are institutions in their own right, with a culture, modus operandi, and funding strategies with which they compete for tightly contested funds. In a way, they too constitute a status quo. Do they re-invent themselves now? For example, does the David Suzuki Foundation (to which I was a founding donor) close up shop or retool its aims and operations? Will Suzuki reduce globe-trotting, reuse his fame portals, and recycle global success stories into a rich compost of new ideas?Sustainable advocacy is an art. Like artists, advocates must grow or stagnate. Environmentalism's failure is bound to spur new thinking and action. Online organizations such as 350.org already display an impressive global reach and response.It's a time for daring. Funders and supporters are seeking out transformation agents and catalytic ideas. They might look to those with bold visions for societal transformation. Organizationally, \"less is more\" may be the way ahead. Increasingly, people and groups are enjoying a partnering synergy made easy by social media.What Will We Say to Children and Youth?This is the hardest question to answer. The three R's won't be abandoned; kids will learn about them and nag their parents. But it's a different kind of environmental education that needs to begin and ramp up at all grade levels. One with connect-the-dots clarity between, say, advertising, consumption habits, pollution and global warming. The young tend to be well informed, although we can understand the impulse to turn away from overwhelming global crises. Yet a great many stay engaged, in all manner of worthwhile pursuits.As Earth advocates go, children and youth are among the most inspiring. Their words move you to the core. We'll need to encourage and amplify their voices, and to support their right to be heard. We need to hear from them. And listen.What's to be learned? Where's the next strategic direction?Is there a financial bailout for our big beautiful planet? Can we say our biosphere is too big to fail? Despite over 20 years of climate stabilization campaigns, in the year 2010 annual greenhouse gas emissions were the highest ever recorded.Humanity is in a survival crisis -- a crisis of identity, conscience and spirit. Who are we as an evolving species? Do we really care more about money than our children? Or is a collective spirit stirring millions to rally for more just and equitable societies?We need a lexicon for reframing global issues into a connected whole, a unifying lens \"for seeing the world anew\": a language of waves, not particles. One that connects and inspires, uplifts everyday life. Can \"sustainability,\" a current buzz word in business and in education, catch on as a moral code of conduct -- in a mainstream movement with children at its heart? Can this be how a shift in consciousness sparks a deep empathy for the present generation and for generations to come?Students, teachers, families, corporate executives, and media need a thorough grounding in restorative sustainability: an intergenerational triple-bottom-line economy (\"bionomy\") that fosters social and environmental well-being. Long term rewards must replace growth-obsessed bottom-line fixation. Without economic maturity, we're still on the new Titanic.Situation critical: the movement to protect and restore Earth's living splendour needs rebranding. Welcome to the post-environment age. Possibilities abound.We all remember advertising jingles from our youth. If jingles are that potent in selling things, why not use music to move ideas -- sustainability -- in populist language? For a massive movement to win the hearts and minds of billions? Or at least those of a huge critical mass?Every society's treasure is its young. Since children are multinational and have the most to gain or lose from our response to environmentalism's failure, we can embrace \"a culture of respect\" for the world's children and their planetary home. Respecting Earth and Child can offer a universal ethic for honouring all of life. Earth-friendly equals Child-friendly, and we all win.Daniel Nocera's synthetic leaf for storing solar energy is among the eco-tech miracles needing support and accelerated pathways to market. Also worth noting is a recent U.S. drive for \"atmospheric trust legislation\" by which governments might rise to meet their \"public trust\" obligation to youth and future generations. These represent glimpses of new ways of seeing possibility and connection.   There is no alternative to a thorough detoxification of the air, water and lands we inhabit. The longer we put this off, the harder it gets for restorative sustainability to take hold. The Gulf oil spill and Fukushima mega-disasters brought little transparency we could trust, and at enormous cost both economic and in public health. In the U.S., the military is the greatest polluter, and there are hundreds of toxic waste sites that need attention. Worldwide, breast milk carries trace levels of PCBs and Dioxins. Only sustainability is a positive vision broad enough to address all of these threats, whose uniquely vulnerable victims are children.The needed shift in consciousness may yet win the day.

St. John's Regional Medical Center was destroyed during the storm, and a new facility named Mercy Hospital Joplin is being rebuilt several blocks from where the original clinic once stood.Security camera footage doesn't show anyone present in the waiting room at the time of the storm, but the video does capture the tumultuous moments the winds come sweeping into the area, lifting everything into the air.On Tuesday, Joplin residents marked the anniversary of the fatal storm by honoring those who died, as well as those who survived and helped during recovery efforts.In order to aid the hospital's expansion, United Arab Emirates Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba recently announced the nation would be donating $5 million for a pediatric section and neonatal intensive care unit, according to the Associated Press.And on Monday, President Barack Obama spoke at Joplin High School's graduation. After the school's building was completely demolished by the tornado, students were relocated to temporary locations across town for the new academic year.\"You will not be defined by the difficulties you face, but how you respond \u2013 with strength, and grace, and a commitment to others,\" Obama said during his address to the senior class.A new high school is expected to open in 2014, the Associated Press reports."}, {"title": "NPR Takes a Deeper Look Into Fracking Boom", "text": "Last week, National Public Radio (NPR) took a deeper look into the natural gas boom in the U.S. The special series, The Fracking Boom: Missing Answers, questions what the gas boom is doing to the air and water in communities where fracking has become a household name.The NPR series explores the question \"Are these wells creating harmful pollutants?\" and dives deep to identify issues caused from the more than 200,000 wells drilled in the U.S. in just under a decade.On May 14, Christopher Joyce's report, With Gas Boom, Pennsylvania Fears New Toxic Legacy, honed in on the impacts of drilling in the Pennsylvania Marcellus formation, including the unexpected nuisance of truck traffic, what to do with the toxic wastewater from fracking, water contamination from spills at well sites and groundwater contamination. With more than 5,000 new wells drilled in Pennsylvania since 2008, residents are deeply concerned about this \"new toxic legacy,\" and the impact fracking has on human health and the environment.On May 15, Rob Stein's report, Sick From Fracking? Doctors, Patients Seek Answers, identified the concerns of residents living near fracking sites and their fear of the unknown impacts natural gas drilling will have on the health of their community. From gusts of fumes occupying their airways and buildings to mysterious health-related symptoms, doctors and residents living in fracking war zones expound on their concerns.Also on May 15, Elizabeth Shogren's report, Close Encounters' With Gas Well Pollution, exposed the concerns in Silt, Colorado, where natural gas drilling well pads have taken over the landscape. Here again, concerns for the community's health are revealed as residents experience \"itchy eyes, scratchy throats and getting sick to their stomachs.\" In this extensive report, it becomes clear that it's time to connect the dots and officially identify the true impacts of hydraulic fracturing on communities before more people are put into harms way.On May 16, Jon Hamilton's report, Medical Records Could Yield Answers on Fracking, explored the health impacts on residents living above the Marcellus Shale formation in northern Pennsylvania that could help resolve the national debate on whether fracking is making people sick. The report begins with a disturbing image of William Reigle, a Pennsylvania resident with fibrosis who is concerned that a nearby fracking well may be aggravating his disease, while he sits in a doctor's office with his nose pinched and blows into a tube testing his airway capacity. The piece focuses on the importance of letting the facts tell the story by evaluating detailed health histories of hundreds of thousands of people living near these fracking sites.Also on May 16, Jon Hamilton's report, Town's Effort to Link Fracking and Illness Falls Short, revealed that scientists are not convinced that the evidence collected blaming health problems on fracking -- from nosebleeds to cancer -- is the cause. However, it's very clear that the small town of Dish, Texas -- population 225 and 35 miles north of Fort Worth -- has not been the same since it became the epicenter of the fracking boom.On May 17, Elizabeth Shogren's report, Fracking's Methane Trail: A Detective Story, followed the work of Gaby Petron, an air pollution investigator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). When Petron saw high levels of methane in readings from a NOAA observation tower north of Denver, she had to determine why there was an increase and where it came from. The results of her observations, which were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, suggest that methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is leaking at at least twice the rate reported by the industry. The report makes clear that \"scientists need to play a much bigger role in measuring air pollution from natural gas production -- at well sites and compressor stations, and over entire gas fields.\"Also on May 17, Susan Phillips's report, Pennsylvania Doctors Worry Over Fracking 'Gag Rule,' explained the new law in Pennsylvania that \"grants physicians access to information about trade-secret chemicals used in natural gas drilling... But the new law also says that doctors can't tell anyone else--not even other doctors -- what's in those formulas. It's being called the 'doctor gag rule.'\" The piece details a case study in which a boy living near natural gas drilling activity is experiencing nosebleeds, liver damage and has a strange skin lesion. Dr. Amy Pare explains that in order to determine what is causing the problems with her patient, it's critical to know exactly what he has been exposed to. Having access to that information through this new law is great, but it's unclear if doctors can legally share this information with their patients and public health officials.After reading and listening to this well-researched NPR series on the U.S. fracking boom, it's very clear to me that referring to natural gas as a cheap, homegrown solution to our nation's energy crisis is absurd. The promise of economic recovery, job growth and community wealth is an illusion that the fossil fuel industry's propaganda machine is selling to the American people. Sacrificing human health and the environment in the name of corporate profits is criminal. We need to educate our fellow Americans about the risks associated with continued use of fossil fuels and support policies that will transition our nation to relying on cleaner, renewable sources of energy.

To talk to him is to encounter an energy and intensity that seem to spring from a divine source, and indeed, he sees his current efforts to put climate change back on the agenda of evangelicals during the 2012 U.S. presidential elections as part of his Christian duty. An evangelical minister for over 30 years, Cizik has been deeply criticized by the GOP and his faith-based community for supporting green climate initiatives. He is nevertheless deeply committed to getting his fellow constituents on his side.Cizik claims that Republicans have had a dismal at best record on any global warming issue. \"They are going to have to defend their inaction. Climate disruptions are occurring. Those living on the edges, those in poverty, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Climate change is a phenomenon of biblical proportions, and its first victims will be those who can least afford to face more suffering.\"He adds that despite what the \"denialists\" are saying, \"They only have to look out of their kitchen windows to see the climate changing.\"Some recent studies suggest climate change could cost the US gulf coast around 300 billion by 2030 due to rising sea levels and natural disasters. However, the conservatives don't seem to be swinging in Cizik's direction. \"We know for example from opinion polls that since about 2006, the percentages of voters who are climate deniers has grown from approximately 3 percent to approximately 12 percent. The efforts by the denialists are well funded. They are concerted and consistent.\"And yet, according to Cizik, as our country enters the next phase in this historic election season, concern about the state of \"God's\" earth will be a key issue that will draw many believers into the Democratic camp. And with just one month to go before the RIO + 20, a UN world summit on sustainability, Cizik believes there is an urgent need to put environmental concerns at the center of the US Presidential election and to secure the political will needed from governments in order to promote sustainable energy policies.In 2008, just ahead of the presidential election between John McCain and Barack Obama, I interviewed Cizik, who was then serving as vice president for governmental affairs at the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE). The NAE represents some 30 million evangelicals across the United States.Back then, I asked him whether there was really any possibility of eroding what seemed like the unwavering loyalty of evangelicals for the Republican party, especially given the widespread view among them that climate change is a hoax. Cizik vehemently asserted that there was, underscoring that as many as 40 percent of Christian evangelicals in the United States were up for grabs during election 2008 due to their dissatisfaction with the party's environmental policies.One in four evangelicals ended up casting their ballots in favor of Obama.That same year, Cizik was added to TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people. He was also forced to resign from the NAE due to his staunch criticism of global climate change deniers. Cizik's termination led to a national uproar within the movement, and over one hundred top evangelical leaders formulated a \"New Evangelical\" pro-environmental agenda.I caught up with Cizik a few weeks ago. He is now serving as president of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good -- a faith-based organization which seeks to promote a fairly progressive agenda, with a focus on immigration reform, environmental protection, and religious tolerance. I asked Cizik what he thought about the latest talks on climate on the Hill and whether his group's notion of creation care -- that we as God's creation must be good stewards of the earth -- might help to sway the opinion of evangelicals in favor of the Democratic party.\"What I say to folks, and it is speculative of course, even so, not being a prophet or the son of a prophet, we do have some basis for suggesting the same percentages are up for grabs again,\" said Cizik referring to the 40% of evangelicals who do not consistently support the Republican party.Cizik was one of 300 signatories to the call to action by the Evangelical Climate Initiative (ECI). The ECI is composed of senior level evangelicals who firmly believe in the United States' role in preventing global climate change. The group states: \"Our deep commitment to Jesus Christ and his commands to love our neighbors, care for 'the least of these,' and be proper stewards of His creation compels us to act. Indeed, many of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that climate change is a real problem and that it ought to matter to us as Christians.\"The call to action is based on four claims: that climate change is the result of human activities, that the poor will be the hardest hit by this change, that Christian moral conviction demand urgent action, and that government, businesses, churches, and individuals all have a role to play in addressing climate change.As Cizik explains, evangelical notions of sin and judgment play an important role in the way they perceive the world. Evangelicals are mandated to do no harm and thus he believes that by working to prevent climate change, he is serving \"God's\" call. \"The preachers job is to say what needs to be said. It is guilt and shame upon us as a people because of climate change. We are going to experience economic pains like never before.\"Cizik and his team have divvied up the evangelical community in the United States into three key voting groups: 40 percent traditionalist, 20 percent modernist, and 40 percent centrist. Cizik himself is what he calls a centrist. He voted republican in every presidential election except in 1976 when he voted for Jimmy Carter and in 2008 when he voted for Obama.He now believes some 45 percent of the growing independent vote are evangelicals and that environmental issues are important for younger, new evangelicals. He also maintains that President Obama needs to become more vocal and proactive on climate issues in order to gain their vote. \"Here is the bottom line. The democratic party would be well advised not to ignore the climate debate.\"Cizik also underscored that growing numbers of evangelicals from non-white backgrounds are more likely to be concerned with the environment than traditional evangelicals. Some statistics show that white and non-white evangelicals constitute almost one third of the population in America. \"We know for example, that in the last Presidential election the exit polls revealed that 38 percent of evangelicals broadly speaking that includes Latinos and African-Americans, voted for Obama.\"Obama is likely to attract more non-white evangelical voters in 2012. The evangelical Latino population has grown to ten million in the United States alone. And with the Republicans supporting a vehemently anti-immigration agenda, this constituency may be a significant swing vote for Obama.There is also the issue of Romney's Mormon faith which some evangelicals find alienating. \"Among those who are likely to be swing voters, the candidate's position on climate should be at the center, it's very important. And Romney has been in a variety of different places on this issue. Barack Obama has not been as much the activist that many of us had hoped he'd be on this topic, but he may yet speak out again.\"In the next few months Cizik and his \"green\" evangelicals plan to work around the clock to support their climate agenda. \"We will work tirelessly to hold both political parties accountable. That's our godly duty. Just as pro-life voters have done it, so will we. We will say 'vote for clean air, pure water, and healthy land.' Believe me, the polluters of the planet are working tirelessly for their agenda. We should be no less committed.\"Cizik firmly believes that a shift must occur among all Americans in order to move from a denialist perspective to a belief that global climate change does in fact exist and that sustainable living is the only way to rescue \"God's\" creation.\"I am not sure evangelicals will become the force for change on the issue. I am a lot more realistic than I was four years ago. But in partnership with Green Faith and the American Values Network, we've already begun our \"I Am a Good Steward\" campaign and the target states are the swing states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Our goal is to build creation care awareness, consumer alternatives, and voter turn-out in non-partisan ways.\""}, {"title": "Report: Keystone Tar Sands Pipeline Will Raise Gas Prices and Cut Oil Supplies", "text": "Despite all the industry hype over jobs and purported energy security benefits from building the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline -- benefits a Brooklyn bridge-builder could propose -- a new report shows the mammoth Canadian tar sands pipeline will cut the amount of gasoline produced in the U.S. and jack up gas prices for American drivers, especially in Midwestern, Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states.That\u2019s right, the dirty oil pipeline from Canada will not only threaten North America\u2019s greatest drinking water sources like the Ogallala Aquifer, slashing through the fertile farmlands and cattle country of America\u2019s agricultural breadbasket, but it will boost the price at the pump for consumers struggling to pay for gas prices near historic highs.The report, \"Keystone XL: A Tar Sands Pipeline to Higher Oil Prices,\" lays out the facts that the oil industry doesn't want Americans to understand -- the controversial TransCanada pipeline will ding consumers at the pump and cut oil supplies whose price is now discounted in the Midwest and in the Rockies. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the report produced by NRDC, Oil Change International and ForestEthics Advocacy; :Keystone XL will take oil currently refined in the Midwest and Rockies and send it to the Gulf Coast where it can be sold on the international market. Oil supplies dedicated to the United States will decline while the Keystone XL pipeline provides the international market with access to that Canadian crude previously meant for the U.S. market. This will have a powerful impact on oil prices in the Midwest and Rockies -- increasing the price of Canadian crude by $20 to $30 a barrel in the 2012 U.S. market, while doing nothing to decrease world oil prices.The bottom line is that Gulf refineries are clamoring for crude they can turn into diesel, the most lucrative petrochemical product right now on the international market. Here's how NRDC's Anthony Swift describes it in his recent blog;Keystone XL is going divert crude oil from the Midwest, a region of the United States where refineries are designed to produce as much gasoline as possible from a barrel of oil, to the Gulf Coast of Texas, where refineries have reconfigured themselves to produce as much diesel as possible from a barrel of crude.So we're going to take oil out of Midwest refineries producing gasoline for U.S. consumers and ship it to Gulf refineries which are focused on making diesel fuel for the international market. Sound like a good deal to you?Well it doesn\u2019t to people like Texas landowner Mike Hathorn, a welder concerned about his family\u2019s property in his east Texas hill country home near Wells. That\u2019s where TransCanada wants to run its 1,700 mile Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf, straight through his family's river-fed land that he says now is threatened by a foreign corporation -- and by foreign oil.Hathorn says he's always been worried about the environmental risks the toxic tar sands brew will pose in this water-rich community. But concern over increases in gas prices is just icing on the cake to this proud Texan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit,\u201d Hathorn says in his thick Texas drawl. \u201cThis pipeline project isn\u2019t helping people out here in the U.S. any. It\u2019s just a Canadian company trying to use the U.S. as a route to get its oil out on the international market. We\u2019re the ones having to take the risk. If it\u2019s going to raise gas prices, then it\u2019s just one more reason not to build it.\u201dCheck out Mike Hathorn\u2019s video and other videos of landowners, farmers, ranchers and citizens opposed to the expansion of tar sands mining operations and pipelines at NRDC\u2019s new website Voices Against Tar Sands.Other reporters have latched onto this oil price conundrum, too. Here\u2019s Bloomberg columnist Jonathan Alter in a recent report:TransCanada\u2019s plan to jack up oil prices is hiding in plain sight. In the appendix to its application to the Canadian National Energy Board (helpfully provided to me by the Natural Resources Defense Council), the company brags that its project is \u201cexpected to realize an increase in the heavy crude price of approximately $3.00 per barrel by avoiding a discount\u201d at the U.S. Gulf Coast. The market price of heavy crudes should rise an additional $3.55 per barrel when the new pipeline \u201crelieves the oversupply situation in the Midwest.\u201dOf course, TransCanada made the claim in 2009, when the discounted price for Canadian crude was only $3 a barrel. In 2012, that discount has skyrocketed to between $20 to $40 a barrel. And that\u2019s why the tar sands industry wants Keystone XL so badly -- it means adding tens of billions of dollars to the annual price of their product, billions that would be paid by you and me.These are facts that are not widely shared by the oil industry, for obvious reasons. But reporters who dig into this come up with the same conclusions: you can\u2019t cut the price of gas Americans pay by importing more toxic tar sands oil from Canada. In fact, the reverse is true; it will boost prices we pay at the pump by creating a conduit of crude to Gulf refineries eager to turn the heavy Canadian bitumen into diesel for export -- and turn a hefty profit doing it.\u201cBig oil and big money\u201d is how Mike Hathorn explains it. And you can bet the American consumer -- and all who depend on a sustainable and healthy planet -- will be the last to benefit from the companies pushing this massive dirty tar sands oil pipeline plan."}, {"title": "Keystone XL Would Raise Gas Prices, Report Finds", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Natural Resources Defense Council on Tuesday released a report dispelling the myth that the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would lower gas prices. Rather, the opposite is true, findings show.On a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, report author and NRDC attorney Anthony Swift called the pipeline's impact on gasoline prices \"one of the most misunderstood issues surrounding the proposed Keystone XL,\" adding that when TransCanada originally proposed the pipeline, they pitched it as a way to increase the cost of oil in the United States, providing increased revenue for Canadian producers. Since then, proponents of the pipeline in the United States have pitched it as a means of decreasing U.S. gasoline prices.Swift's study examined these two conflicting claims, and findings suggest that the former is the true one. \"Our study has found that Keystone XL is likely to both decrease the amount of gasoline in U.S. refineries for domestic markets and increase the cost of producing it, leading to even higher prices at the pump,\" Swift told reporters.TransCanada did not immediately return a request for comment.The report found the pipeline will increase U.S. gasoline prices by three mechanisms, most immediately by reducing the amount of gasoline produced in the United States. The pipeline will divert crude oil from Midwestern refineries, which are designed to produce as much gasoline as possible from a barrel of oil, to Texas Gulf refineries, which are designed to produce as much diesel as possible from a barrel of oil. The result in the immediate to short term will be a decline in gasoline production and an increase in diesel, according to the report.Other findings in the report include that the pipeline will increase the price of crude oil in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains by over $20 a barrel, increasing the cost of Canadian tar sands by as much as $27 billion annually. These higher crude oil costs are expected to lead to deteriorating financial conditions in Rocky Mountain and Midwestern refineries, which could in turn result in decreased production. That's because if Midwestern refineries are forced to pay a higher price for oil, as East Coast refineries already do, they will be forced to respond by reducing their production and further decreasing U.S. gasoline supplies, according to the report.These findings come as the House and Senate are in conference to hammer out a final version of the transportation bill. A provision in the House version of the bill would approve the pipeline, overriding President Obama\u2019s rejection of the pipeline application in January, but a similar provision has not, as yet, been included in the Senate's version. The president has promised to veto any measure that includes Keystone XL approval."}, {"title": "15 Ridiculously Adorable Baby Owls", "text": "We're not sure if it's the wide eyes, fluffy down, tiny size or a combination of all three that makes baby owls so adorable, but whichever it is, it works!

If this happens, the state will lose jobs, our booming solar industry will suffer a major setback, and our progress at cutting emissions and displacing dirty energy will stop in its tracks.At issue is a proposed ruling that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is slated to consider Thursday, May 24, which would increase the number of rooftop-solar installations that qualify for \"net metering.\" Net metering is like the rollover credits on your cellphone. It enables utility customers with solar panels connected to the grid to receive full credit for all of the electricity they produce. Excess power generated during sunny daylight hours gets fed back to the grid, and the customers earn a credit that helps offset their electricity costs during the times when they're using more power than they are generating.Net metering is fair, and it's a critical part of the equation for making rooftop solar installations affordable for thousands of homeowners and small businesses. Thanks in large part to net metering, California has one gigawatt of customer-owned clean energy (over 100,000 rooftop solar systems). In addition, clean energy fed back onto the grid by net-metered systems makes it possible for California to turn off more \"peaker\" power plants -- the state's dirtiest and least-efficient -- which are typically powered by diesel or gas and sited near poor neighborhoods.Most California consumers probably take it for granted that they should receive the full value of energy they generate and put back into the grid. Why would they choose to buy or lease rooftop solar panels if they will be forced to give away a significant percentage of the power they generate to the same utility that's sending them a bill every month?But we can't take net metering for granted, because when California passed its net metering law in 1996, it included restrictions. Most alarmingly, under the current law, utilities can refuse to accept new net-metering customers altogether once the amount of power coming from those customers reaches five percent of \"aggregate customer peak demand.\"The utilities have chosen to interpret \"aggregate customer peak demand\" as meaning the highest overall system demand for energy in California history, which was on July 25, 2006 during a record heat wave that killed more than 100 people. Under that interpretation, California will reach its five percent net-metering cap at approximately 2.5 gigawatts -- which could happen as soon as early next year. The CPUC has proposed that a more sensible way to calculate \"aggregate customer peak demand\" is to add up (aggregate) the peak demand of every individual utility customer. If you calculate it that way, California will reach its net-metering cap at approximately 4.6 gigawatts of capacity. To put that in context, Governor Brown has said the state needs to reach 12 gigawatts of installed local clean energy sources such as rooftop solar panels, small wind turbines and fuel cells by 2020.Clean, renewable, locally generated energy is not a luxury for California nor, for that matter, the rest of the world. Failing to use clean energy translates to continuing to use dirty, polluting fossil fuels that threaten our health, our economy and our climate. We cannot afford to stumble when we should be running as hard as we can to take full advantage of the energy that rains down on our rooftops day after day -- most of it wasted as we burn more coal, frack for more natural gas and drill for more oil. California is a leader -- not just in the United States, but in the world. It would be shameful if utility companies in this forward-looking state succeeded in making it harder for their customers to harvest the clean solar energy of the future.The customers who want to buy or lease solar systems wouldn't be the only ones affected, either. At a time when the residential construction industry is still struggling, the boom in solar-rooftop installations has created thousands of badly needed jobs, which would be put in jeopardy.Utility companies can't have it both ways. They cannot boast about how much they love clean energy while simultaneously working to undermine it. If the utilities don't like net metering (which, clearly, they don't), then the proper response is to propose something better -- not to sabotage the current system and derail the transition to clean, locally generated power."}, {"title": "Why Arrest Paul Watson in the First Place?", "text": "The good news is that Paul Watson is out on bail in Germany, but the harassment continues. The real question to be asked is: Why arrest Paul Watson now?I think the answer to this question is a reflection on human society in general. For 30+ years many individuals and groups have worked tirelessly to make society understand the basic laws of nature. It has worked and we are now close to our goals...I can agree to disagree with many, but I can never understand the people that ignore their health for the sake of money. When you are sick you don't, but... how many coal miners have given up their health for the almighty dollar? How many individuals and corporations pollute the very communities where they raise their children? We can no longer, as humans, continue to just take. There are some wild areas left, but lets face it, they are just large zoos. The wilderness is gone.Perhaps the U.S. has more forests today than when the Europeans arrived -- a fact trumpeted by the oracle Rush Limbaugh -- but they are farmed forests, not natural forests filled with biodiversity and ruled by interdependence: two of the \"big three\" when it comes to the laws of nature. The third law is \"finite resources\"... let's not go there.Individuals such as Paul Watson are winning. Parents want clean air and water for their children and grandchildren. Corporations really \"get it\" if you believe the ads on TV. And I don't, by the way.So why do governments lock up Paul Watson now?Maybe he has become too relevant.

Maybe now is the time for those unenlightened humans who feel they are in fact more powerful than Mother Nature to strike a blow for their cause.Maybe now is the time for those in power to strike back, and what better symbol than Paul Watson? Are we going to let them? The answer from this bona fide tree hugger is: no!Watch SHARKWATER or my film and you can see at least parts of the incident in question. You might disagree with the tactics, but the facts are pretty straightforward. Guatemala asked for assistance and Paul Watson helped arrest an illegal fishing boat. In my opinion, Japan's money is implicated, and we can all debate his guilt, but nonetheless, all humans who respect the principles of nature and believe we can find a sustainable existence have to stand up and demand Paul Watson is not only released but exonerated. Heck, Costa Rica should arrest the fishermen.We will see how this all plays out, but for those interested in the environment, watch closely. There is something very wrong when a blind writer from China gets Hillary Clinton's attention and weeks of news coverage, and Paul Watson's arrest is hardly mentioned outside the Internet.

The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found a solid majority of Americans would be willing to pay more on their energy bills if they knew their money was being invested in truly renewable power sources like wind and solar. And 'more' doesn't mean pocket change. If the option was to pay an additional $35 a year or nearly three bucks monthly, a whopping 81 percent of respondents would be happy to pony up. Even at $155 per year, or an extra $12 a month, a solid majority (56 percent) of Americans would have no problem opening their wallets for clean power. (For reference, three dollars per month is just a bit more than the statewide distributed household cost of getting a moderate-sized offshore wind power farm constructed, as we've been trying to do in Maryland).That's got to come as a blow to the Solyndra-gate spin-doctors, whose endless conniptions and campaign-trail digs about the failed solar manufacturer have apparently failed to persuade American voters that the entire clean-energy industry is a massive socialistic boondoggle. Instead, it seems many Americans have managed to grasp a simple fact that has unsurprisingly through the spin-doctors' oil-greased fingers: that there's no way our domestic clean-energy industry can compete when we feed it crumbs and countries like China gorge their manufacturers on subsidies.  But that's not all the study revealed. The polling also cast some doubt upon the political necessity of embracing an \"all of the above\" energy strategy, as the Obama administration has chosen to do with increasing vigor in the run up to the 2012 election. That strategy says you can't call for boosting clean-energy development without also calling for increased production of dirty-energy sources like natural gas and nuclear. If that were unquestionably the case, poll results should have found an increased willingness to pay higher energy costs if the extra money were going toward renewables and dirty energy. But they didn't. Instead, the Harvard study found that for a variety of price levels, public support for higher energy costs either stayed about the same or declined when natural gas and nuclear were thrown into the mix.That might be food for thought for an administration looking to generate election-year enthusiasm in its liberal base. To the climate-action crowd, embracing an all-of-the-above strategy on energy is a lot like trying to say you're evolving on the issue of same sex marriage. It's lukewarm and leaves your base lukewarm. It means you want to placate everyone -- and unfortunately like gay marriage, energy and climate policy has become far too polarized an issue for such ambivalence. It's high time for President Obama's \"marriage-equality moment\" on climate and clean energy. It's time to unequivocally say \"I do\" to real solutions. As with marriage equality, the president might be pleasantly surprised to find that coming out means no love lost on the right and a surge of enthusiasm from a politically active constituency.Now if only the veep would make a slip about how much he loathes fracking and loves the thought of a carbon fee-and-dividend program."}, {"title": "Shanghai Is Sinking: How Building Up Is Bringing It Down", "text": "Shanghai\u2019s skyline glitters with sleek financial skyscrapers and glossy residential towers, but below the city\u2019s lustrous facade lies an enduring problem.

The co-sponsors of the meeting along with Heartland itself, go grants totaling almost $5.5 million from Exxon Mobil and $13.8 million from the Koch brothers foundations since the late 1990s.Their work together goes way back.

Ever since the world woke up to the climate crisis, this mob has been working to delay action by distracting the public and policy arena with misinformation.Steve Coll's new book Private Empire gives an in depth account of Exxon's front group climate denial funding effort that accelerated after the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.

Even so, the activist -- and the Humane Society -- say they were appalled by the level of depravity they ultimately documented in an undercover video that has since touched off an investigation by state officials and raised fresh questions about animal welfare on the nation's factory farms.\"When you walk in, all of these sows are showing this volume of insanity,\" the undercover filmmaker, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, said in an exclusive interview with The Huffington Post. \"They're swaying, they're biting the bars, they're listing in front of the cages and they're docked and bloody.\"The abuse depicted in the video is unequivocal, and local law enforcement, as well as state livestock officials, have launched a probe of the facility, Wyoming Premium Farms, which is owned by the Japanese meat processing giant Itoham. Industry representatives have condemned the actions depicted in the video but have argued that they are aberrations in an otherwise amply regulated and humane system that produces more than 92 million pounds of meat and poultry in the U.S. annually. According to a USDA report released in April 2012, U.S. commercial hog slaughter in 2011 totaled 110.9 million head.Doug DeRouchey, the manager of the Wyoming Premium facility, told The Huffington Post on Friday that his company was conducting its own investigation and that at least five employees have been fired. \"We're reviewing all the options right now that are available out there,\" DeRouchey said. \"There's probably going to be changes -- we don't know what.\"Pork industry representatives told The Huffington Post that the abuse shown in the video is extraordinarily rare. \"It's just like having a driver's license,\" said Paul Sundberg, vice president of science and technology for the National Pork Board, which promotes the pork industry. \"Just because somebody runs a red light, doesn't mean there's a problem with red lights.\"But animal rights advocates and other critics of the industry argue that red lights are being run far too often. They say the patchwork of state and local laws governing animal treatment at factory farms is demonstrably inadequate, and that a proliferation of similar animal-abuse videos suggest that the industry is incapable of policing itself. They also argue that what rules do exist are written so loosely that the industry is able to define, more or less for themselves, what's cruel and what's not.\"Things you would be thrown in jail for doing to a dog or cat, you can do with impunity to farm animals,\" said Paul Shapiro, the Humane Society's vice president for farm animal protection. \"Not because pigs don't suffer like dogs do, but just because the agriculture business industry has been so politically influential, it's carved out these giant loopholes to evade responsibility for complying with the basic anti-cruelty codes we have in all states.\"DOCUMENTING ABUSEAccording to the Humane Society, an anonymous tip led the organization to focus its attention on Wyoming Premium, a collection of four facilities just north of the town of Wheatland. The farm, which provides jobs for as many as 60 people earning between $9 and $13 an hour, according to DeRouchey, is a major employer in the area.The facility opened in 1995 and has occasionally tussled with local landowners over issues of odor and other complaints, but incidents of abuse have been rare, DeRouchey said.\"The first thing you'd notice is the smell of the barn,\" said the undercover Humane Society activist, who was hired in April to work in the pig breeding part of the operation. HuffPost requested that the activist provide a paystub to verify that she had worked for Wyoming Premium. \"You can smell it from the street,\" she said of the facility. \"People who were excited to have somebody new would tell me things like, 'You're going to see some fucked-up shit.'\u201dOver the course of a month, and equipped with undercover cameras, the activist documented male and female workers who appear to prod, punch and sit on a pig unable to move due to a broken leg. They can be seen flipping young piglets through the air, and sows can be seen squealing in restrictive \"gestation stalls.\"In one instance not captured on video, the Human Society said, a worker allegedly stuck an arm into a sow's anus, rather than into its uterus, causing a severe injury that went untreated for over a week.The activist says she befriended a fellow worker -- a woman around her own age -- who expressed concern about the abuse. \"I watched her apologize to some of the sows. She'd let them out during weaning. She'd walk around and treat abscesses on her own without being told to, and she was the only one that would,\" the activist said.Where she could, the filmmaker says she intervened -- giving water to a dying sow and reporting the pig with the broken leg to a barn manager -- but the majority of the abuse captured in the video is perhaps most remarkable for its offhanded administration.\"They would just kick a sow in the face to get her to turn around, and the sow would scream and run away,\" the activist told HuffPost, \"and I would just stand there and act like it was normal. And they think it is normal, because they\u2019ve just been doing it for so long,\" she said, \"or because that\u2019s just how everybody else does it, or just because that's the easiest way.\"ANOMALY OR STANDARD PRACTICE?The National Pork Board's \"Pork Quality Assurance Plus\" program is designed to educate producers on food safety and animal care, and to provide guidelines and best practices for the industry.Among other things, the PQA Plus manual describes abuse and neglect as:[A]cts outside of normally accepted production practices that intentionally cause pain and suffering including, but not limited to: 1) Intentionally applying prods to sensitive parts of the animal such as the eyes, ears, nose or rectum; 2) Malicious hitting/beating of an animal; 3) Purposeful failure to provide minimal food, water and care that results in significant harm or death to animals.If the abuse is observed, the guide suggests intervening and alerting authorities.But according to the Humane Society's Paul Shapiro, acute violence like that seen in the Wyoming Premium video is hardly unprecedented. Precise numbers to back that up are difficult to compile, though Shapiro noted that while animal rights groups only conduct an estimated five to 10 investigations each year, abuse is discovered with \"troubling frequency.\" He ticked off several recent cases of abuse uncovered at farms and plants from Vermont to California.Indeed, the rise of video documentation of farm animal abuse prompted the Center for Food Integrity, a nonprofit formed in 2007 that represents farmers and ranchers, universities, food processors, restaurants and other members of the food supply chain, to form an Animal Care Review Panel in February.Candace Croney, an associate professor of animal behavior and well-being at Purdue University and a member of the panel, said she believed the sort of rough handling seen in the Wyoming Premium Farms video was rare, though she added: \"I can't tell you this is one isolated incident, based on the fact that these videos seem to keep recurring.\"The only other video the panel has so far reviewed was taken at a pig breeding factory farm in Leland, Iowa. It showed what appeared to be the violent castration of squealing piglets, and adult sows squeezed into narrow gestation stalls -- controversial pens that prevent the pigs from turning around or even lying down properly, and in which they spend much of their adult lives. Such practices, however, are not considered extraordinary.\"As contentious as it may be, it's pretty much standard industry practice in the swine industry today,\" Croney explained. \"The handling that you saw of those animals, while it may not be warm and fuzzy, was not abusive handling of animals.\"Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, an industry group, said gestation crates help to protect pigs from weather extremes and diseases, while allowing for individualized attention to health. \"The only real measure we have of whether they're doing well in that type of system is the number of piglets they're having, and that's at an all-time high.\"DeRouchey said pigs are happier in the pens. \"There's a lot of noise going on because it's feeding time,\" he said, referring to the pigs in gestation crates seen in the video. \"Most people don't realize that's what's going on. They're all happy at the gestation stall environment: they all get fed at the same time.\"Still, restaurant and grocery chains like McDonald's, Safeway and Smithfield Foods have all begun to distance themselves from factory farms that use gestation crates. In Europe, Great Britain and Sweden have banned the practice. Denmark will phase out their use next year, and several U.S. states have outlawed the crates, including California, Arizona and Florida.More generally, oversight of animal welfare on factory farms in the U.S. is spotty. The federal Animal Welfare Act regulates the treatment of animals in research, exhibition, transportation and by dealers, but it does not extend to the treatment of farm animals. Dave Sacks, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said such AWA oversight \"would take Congress stepping in.\"There are federal laws that apply to the slaughter and transportation of farm animals, but Shapiro argued that these are inadequate and that better laws are needed to protect animals while they are being raised. \"The amount of time animals spend in a federally inspected slaughterhouse is minutes,\" he said. \"On farms it's years. For 99 percent of their lives, they have no federal protection.\"Virtually all states have animal cruelty provisions, but they often exempt what critics say are ill-defined industry standards. According to state Sen. Fred Emerich (R-Cheyenne), Wyoming passed new livestock legislation, effective July 1 of last year, \"because of considerable ambiguity over who had jurisdiction.\" The legislation also clarifies that it is illegal to commit an \"act, omission or neglect whereby the willful and malicious infliction of pain or suffering is caused, permitted or allowed to continue when there is a reasonable remedy or relief.\"The task of monitoring the welfare of animals on factory farms falls to the Wyoming Livestock Board. The board's director, Leanne Stevenson, said some of the actions depicted on the Wyoming Premium video appeared to be \"definitely beyond the realm of what are condonable practices.\"But Rebecca J. Huss, a professor of law at Valparaiso University in Indiana, says that the meat industry still enjoys a good deal of latitude in defining what is \"condonable.\"\"If enough people do it, then it's commonly accepted, even if the general population wouldn't understand or think that it's humane,\" said Huss, who served as guardian for the abused animals in the 2007 dog-fighting case against professional football player Michael Vick. She cites the common use of gestation crates as an example. \"If gestation crates are prevalent, it would take them out of the definition of cruelty, so it's an odd circular reasoning, isn't it?\"According to Emerich, there's a lot of discussion around gestation crates and he suspects the housing system \"will probably go away in years to come.\"Representatives of factory farms counter that industry norms are based on scientific studies and years of developing best strategies. \"The farmers who work with the animals every day, who make animal well-being their top priority, are best able to decide what's good for their animals, not a bureaucrat in the state capital or Washington, D.C.,\" said Warner, the NPPC spokesman.What happened at Wyoming Premium, Warner and other industry representatives say, is clearly not acceptable practice. But animal welfare advocates argue that better oversight is still needed.\"Here you have a case where it's not just the fox guarding the henhouse, the fox is actually deciding what the rules of the henhouse are going to be,\" said the Humane Society's Shapiro. \"All that's required is enough farmers to participate in the cruelty to have it exempted from the cruelty laws.\"FALLOUT ON THE FARMIn the aftermath of the video's release, DeRouchey said Wyoming Premium invited an independent auditor to tour the facility, along with the farm's veterinarian, to ensure that \"the animals that are still there are being well taken care of and there's no more issues, as far as that goes.\"Last week, he said, all remaining employees were put through the industry's quality assurance training. \"We reiterated that animal abuse is not going to be tolerated,\" he said. \"It's not necessary.\"Representatives of the farm's parent company, Itoham Foods of Japan, could not be reached for comment. DeRouchey said he was in contact with Itoham's American subsidiary, Itoham America, and that they were deliberating over next steps.The website for Wyoming Premium Farms went down shortly after the Humane Society made its video public.The Humane Society says it provided the video and additional details, which have not been made public, to the Platte County sheriff's department, which in turn requested that the Wyoming Livestock Board lead the investigation. The board will send its findings to the county attorney for review to determine if criminal charges will be filed.Asked whether the statutes that outline which agencies oversee livestock welfare needed clarifying, Stevenson of the Wyoming Livestock Board said she wasn't sure. \"That discussion is a healthy discussion to have,\" she said. \"I can't speak as far as whether the legislatures see a need for changing that, because it has been working the way we have currently been operating.\"It does work,\" she added. \"Should we fix something that's not really broken?\u201dA month before she began her undercover investigation at Wyoming Premium, the Humane Society's undercover investigator noted that Iowa had made it illegal to gain access to a farm facility under false pretenses.A handful of other states, including Kansas and North Dakota have related \"ag gag\" laws, and more are considering similar legislation.The activist says she remains undeterred, and that she plans to continue conducting undercover investigations.As for the pigs at Wyoming Premium Farms, she said: \"I hope that everything works out on behalf of those wonderful animals that are stuck in there.\""}, {"title": "National Vegetarian Week 2012: Celebrate U.K. Holiday With Pictures Of Cute Baby Animals (PHOTOS)", "text": "It's National Vegetarian Week in the U.K., and one great way to spread awareness of the impact of a meat-free lifestyle is with a slideshow of adorable baby animal photos.While factory farming leads to the mistreatment and slaughter of countless animals, it's also crucial to recognize that many other species are hunted for other reasons -- whether its their ivory or horns, or simply for sport.That's why there are also some uncommon faces included in the slideshow.

If this statement by Fatih Birol last week wasn't a dire warning, then I don't know what is: \"What I see now with existing investments for plants under construction... we are seeing the door for a 2 degree Celsius target about to be closed and closed forever.\"A global rise in temperature of 2\u00b0C is widely considered to be a threshold beyond which catastrophic climate change is likely to occur; many scientists and governments consider 1.5\u00b0 a safer bet. And we're talking here about catastrophic with a capital C -- for many communities around the world, climate change has already proved catastrophic.So how did the leaders of the G8 richest countries respond to this warning at their summit in Camp David last week?By speaking in platitudes, at best: \"Different energy sources have different inherent risks and must be developed in a safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable manner.\"So here's why the G8 missed the point. Nothing in the \"Camp David Declaration\" comes even close to moving us off the frightening trajectory which the IEA is warning about. It explicitly endorses an \"all of the above\" approach to meeting our energy needs, and foresees continued long-term investment in extracting every last drop of petroleum from the breadth and depth of the planet:\"We are committed to establishing and sharing best practices on energy production, including exploration in frontier areas and the use of technologies such as deep water drilling and hydraulic fracturing... \"On the issue of fossil fuel subsidies, the declaration merely reiterates previous commitments to phasing them out over the medium term, despite the fact that according to Birol \"we are going backwards.\" From 2010 to 2012, fossil fuel subsidies increased from $400 billion to $630 billion.If you think this is an issue of environment vs. economics, think again.

We are using 50 percent more resources than the Earth can provide, and unless we change course that number will grow very fast -- by 2030, even two planets will not be enough.\"The question is whether our elected leaders are listening to these warnings.

Don't get me wrong: I love all verbal and theological things: story, theology, politics and history, perhaps even inordinately.But I believe in places. I believe that relationships, rooted in love, transform us. And it just so happens that most lasting human relationships are formed around the table.In the Eucharist, the ordinary is made sacred. The original Eucharist tradition as recorded in the book of Acts and later Paul was a feast that united people of all incomes and races in a common purpose.The Eucharist gathers us at particular place, with a particular people, to eat particular food(s) together. While we believe theologically that Christ is present at the table with us, the Eucharist is more about what you do than what you believe.The Eucharist is about gathering community and being together. It recognizes that gathering around the table is a sacred act. Our relationships expand from the table outwards into the world, teaching us how to love one another through the lens of table hospitality: as old as time itself, but intentionally sacred.You may have guessed by now that I do not limit the Eucharist to Sunday morning. I believe that all of the foods we eat at our tables are sacred: not through their essential nature, but through the relationships that they represent: relationships between farmers and communities, relationships between food and bodies, food and the earth, and farms and our ecosystem. I believe Christ is present whenever two or more gather in his name.The table is a place where we bypass rank and privilege and create a zone where you take what you need and bring what you are able. It is a commons where we are defined in new, equal relationships with one another, ensuring that all have enough and sharing. Believers in Acts took the idea of the common table even further and held all possessions in common, caring for the widows and dispossessed from the surplus, bypassing the inequality created by the currency stamped with the deified Caesar.Our relationships are holy, and so they must be sustainable: wrought with great care for the integrity of communities and creation. Our tables are a microcosm of the way we live out our faith.We know that hospitality is a sacred duty, as are all of our relationships within our economic system. A sacred relationship is one formed in love and rooted in mutual respect. It is therefore sustainable because it respects the health and integrity of all members of the relationship. God is calling all things into sustainability and right relation. Can you hear it?Yes: this is practical. Abstract theology is safe, because it commits to nothing concrete, but theologies out of lived experiences of God present in community are dangerous because they invite the hearer to participate. Faith without works is dead.So I will tell you how we are carrying out this theology. The Quixote Center's Crabgrass Christians Initiative is organizing local church/farmer distribution relationships based loosely around the the Kentucky organization New Roots' Fresh Stop model.Our vision is to distribute in-season, local, wholesale, organic or near-organic fresh produce from churches to community and church members once every two weeks. People with higher incomes will pay more so that those with less will be able to afford it, restoring economic inequality in a small way.We will teach classes at local churches that help us understand the holiness of food and table and the inequalities in our food system. These classes are designed to empower lay people to be leaders and carry out the work of the program.In the long term, we will learn about our foods and tables by visiting farms and re-creating the local, particular relationships that have been broken by a globalized food production system that obscures the chemicals, unjust pricing systems and unsustainable practices that dominate our grocery stores.Yes, the Eucharist calls us to invest in a particular place, with particular people, in sustainable relationships. And this, my sisters and brothers, can challenge our basic assumptions about the make-up of our world by giving us a vision of what a restorative community looks like.Amen.Want to get involve?

At stake: a new global green deal that could pull our planet back from the brink of irreversible climate change.Two months ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that the world is heading towards a 6\u00b0C temperature rise by the end of this century: \"Energy-related CO2 emissions are at historic highs, we estimate that energy use and CO2 emissions would almost double by 2050.\"A 6\u00b0C temperature rise would mark the end of most life here on earth. According to Australia's Climate Change Research Centre, it would create something \"similar to the depths of the last ice age.\"The clock is ticking. The IEA says that global warming will hit the point of no return in 5 years time. And according to leading NASA climate scientist Jim Hansen, \"In the near term, things will be bad enough.\" He says that there will be widespread drought followed by floods: \"Economic losses would be incalculable. Food prices will rise to unprecedented levels. If this sounds apocalyptic, it is.\"According to a recent report from the World Wildlife Fund, there has already been a 30% decline in wildlife since 1970. \"There would be panic if the FTSE index showed a decline like this,\" says Professor Tim Blackman from the UK's Institute of Zoology. \"Nature is more important than money. Humanity can live without money, but we can't live without nature and the essential services it provides.\"And it's not too late, not yet. But, \"we need to address this with the same urgency and determination with which we tackled the systemic financial crisis,\" says David Nussbaum, CEO of WWF-UK.97% of all climate scientists now see extreme weather as a \"serious\" risk to our planet. This is not some splinter view espoused by the fringes of society, this is the mainstream. In the words of Jim Hansen: \"The science of the situation is clear -- it's time for the politics to follow.\"So, why hasn't it? According to Helen Clark, the head of the UN's development program, it's because it's too politically risky and this is a problem if one is only in power for four years.But, according to Nick Clegg, the UK's deputy prime minister, \"Some say that we have to choose between boosting growth and being green. What a load of rubbish. Going for growth means going green. The race is on to lead the world in clean energy.\"In other words, the rise of the green sector may herald the start of our next industrial revolution. And, as economist Lord Stern points out:Industrial revolutions bring some dislocation. When the electric light came in, the whalers and the candle makers had to adjust. But, there are huge opportunities; it's a story of growth; a story of innovation; and going to the pioneers.Lord Stern believes that fossil fuel subsidies need to be phased out and ploughed into the green economy instead. According to the IEA, over $400 billion was spent on the fossil fuel sector in 2010. In the same year, green energy received less than one fifth of that money.British barrister Polly Higgins adopts a similar view. She believes that the \"problem needs to be part of the solution.\" She says that we need to abolish subsidies for polluting industries; outlaw those sectors and then create financial incentives in the other direction so that those same companies can thrive in a world of clean energy. Essentially, we need to turn \"the poacher into the gamekeeper.\"Polly Higgins then takes another step forward. She believes that environmental destruction should be treated as an international peace crime just like genocide and other crimes against humanity:We need to expand our circle of concern so that it's not just human life, but all life on earth. It's not just humanity that is sacred; all life is sacred. We need to put people and planet over and above profit. We are standing at the precipice of civilization where morally it is wrong to cause this damage. And, we can close this door much like we closed the door to slavery 200 hundred years ago.She has asked the UN to accept \"ecocide\" as the 5th crime against peace and will present her case before world leaders in Rio next month: \"Ecocide is in essence the very antithesis of life. It leads to resource depletion, and where there is an escalation of resource depletion, war comes chasing behind.\"According to Sir David King, the UK's former head scientist, we are facing a century of 'resource wars.' But, as Ms Higgins points out, our global future need not be so bleak. We can put an end to this mindless destruction, and regain control of our destiny here on earth by protecting the planet that gives us home.In the words of George Bernard Shaw, \"We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility of our future.\" It's time for us to act wise, otherwise we may forsake our future. Michelangelo once said, \"I saw the angel in the marble, and carved until I set her free.\" We can all see our planetary angel and she's suffering; it's time to set her free."}, {"title": "Science in Defense of a National Treasure: EPA Releases Its Scientific Assessment of Large-Scale Mining", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a major step forward today in its review of petitions to intervene in the intensifying battle over the proposed Pebble Mine in the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska. After 15 months of study, the agency released in draft form for public comment an extensive scientific assessment of the Bristol Bay watershed undertaken to determine the potential impacts of large-scale mining on salmon and other fish populations, wildlife, development, and Alaska Native communities and culture in the region.And those impacts are devastating: The destruction of fish spawning and rearing streams; elimination of thousands of acres of wetland; reduction in the amount and quality of fish habitat due to water removal; and a whole host of other impacts, both direct and indirect. If the Pebble Mine fails, salmon and other fish species would be devastated -- forever. Even assuming no failure -- an assumption without basis in empirical fact -- the impacts on pristine salmon spawning habitat will be irreparable.The agency initiated this massive assessment in February 2011 at the specific request of nine federally-recognized tribes in the Bristol Bay region, the Bristol Bay Native Corporation (a multi-billion dollar developer and the largest land-owner in the Bristol Bay region, representing over 9,000 native shareholders), commercial and sports fishing interests, and other concerned stakeholders.At the heart of the matter is the Pebble Mine -- a giant gold and copper mine proposed to be sited at the headwaters of the Bristol Bay watershed. The countless meandering streams that make up the watershed feed one of the most productive wild salmon fisheries in the world, supporting valuable fishing and tourism-related industry, indigenous people, and a vast array of wildlife.The corporate partnership behind the Pebble Mine -- the Pebble Limited Partnership, comprising the foreign mining giants Anglo American, Northern Dynasty, and Rio Tinto -- has actively opposed EPA's work on the Watershed Assessment released today.In 2010, the Obama Administration recognized the unique importance of the region, barring offshore oil and gas exploration in Bristol Bay. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar described Bristol Bay as \"a national treasure that we must protect\" and \"too special\" to drill.In today's announcement, the EPA reiterated the importance of Bristol Bay and noted these key findings:\u2022 All five species of North American Pacific salmon are found in Bristol Bay. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. The Kvichak River produces more sockeye salmon than any other river in the world. The Nushagak River is the fourth largest producer of Chinook salmon in North America.  \u2022 Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery and other ecological resources provide at least 14,000 full and part-time jobs and is valued at about $480 million annually. \u2022 The average annual run of sockeye salmon is about 37.5 million fish. \u2022 Bristol Bay provides habitat for numerous animal species, including 35 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and 40 animal species.The EPA also examined the importance of Bristol Bay salmon in sustaining the traditional subsistence lifestyle of Alaska Native villages in the watershed.The agency's Watershed Assessment will provide local, state, and federal decision-makers with science-based information on how to best protect the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery, and the people, communities, commerce, and wildlife that depend on the salmon.NRDC joins the Alaska Natives, Bristol Bay residents, and commercial and subsistence fishermen of the region in applauding EPA's decision to conduct a thorough and scientific review. We will review and comment on the agency's Watershed Assessment during the public comment process initiated today.And we fully support any future decision by the agency -- indeed, we urge EPA -- to invoke their authority under the Clean Water Act to proactively protect the region from the inevitably devastating impacts of the Pebble Mine. The Bristol Bay watershed is a natural resource -- and a natural ecosystem unsurpassed anywhere in the world -- too important to risk."}, {"title": "Irresponsible Care: National Children's Study Faces changes That May Put Children's Health at Greater Risk", "text": "In 2000, many children's health advocates applauded Congress's decision to direct the NIH to study \"the effects of both chronic and intermittent exposures on child health and human development.\" Law-makers specified that the exposures should be biological, chemical, physical and psychosocial, and that the study should address health disparities and monitor U.S. children in all their diversity.Today, the National Children's Study is being halted due to budgetary restraints, management issues, compounded by the NIH's desire to create wholesale incentives, changes in sampling strategy that may undermine the study's scientific value.Without science that pinpoints and correlates early exposures to environmental toxins that may lead to diseases later in life, we are at a loss in determining how chemicals affect human health. Especially the health of children whose early physiological development makes them more vulnerable.Healthy Child Healthy World is part of a large coalition of nonprofits, an advocacy group, Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families which revealed on Friday that the public was mislead by the chemical industry's largest trade association stating that they engaged in phony public campaigns and manipulated science to accomplish its own regulatory agenda.All of this activity was in defense of flame retardants that the industry claims were required for household furniture and other products.Public health advocates have long pushed for stronger standards on flame retardants, and, in particular, those containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PDBEs). Several states have already taken steps to ban the use of some PBDEs, citing studies that suggest they cause harmful health effects -- especially in children.Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, sent a letter to American Chemistry Council (ACC) President Cal Dooley after a Chicago Tribune series last week exposed industry tactics.\"This is a critical moment for the American Chemistry Council,\" said Andy Igrejas, the coalition's director. \"It cannot duck this story and maintain any credibility.\"Flame retardants known as PBDE's have been proven to have harmful affects on children yet its manufacturers, Albemarle, Chemtura Corp. and ICL Industrial Products are three members of the \"Responsible Care\" program. The article revealed that the CEO of Albemarle in fact, chaired a committee that oversaw ACC's chemical safety programs.\"If the deeply unethical behavior documented in the Tribune series is considered acceptable under Responsible Care, then it is meaningless as a code of conduct,\" Igrejas said. \"If companies can violate Responsible Care with impunity, then it is also meaningless.\"The Environmental Protection Agency has sought to add a category of PBDEs to a \"chemicals of concern\" list that could lead to stronger regulations. That proposal, however, has been stalled at the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for two years.Our taxpayer dollars are not being spent wisely if chemical companies can breach codes and violate not just ethics but the health of today's children and future generations.The billions of dollars of health care costs will not begin to supplant the loss in gross national productivity as our children's children suffer from diseases that could have been prevented.In response to an article from Nature, an international weekly journal of science, May 16, 2012."}, {"title": "UN Bonn Climate Conference Delegates Say Greenhouse Gas Ambitions Lacking", "text": "* Reluctance to take on more ambitious CO2 cut targets* Pressure is on as climate risks growBy Nina ChestneyBONN, Germany, May 21 (Reuters) - Reluctance to raise ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions due to economic constraints is threatening progress towards limiting global warming, delegates at United Nations' climate talks in Germany warned on Monday.The talks in Bonn, which end on May 25, are partly to discuss ways of raising the level of ambition on cuts but the worsening eurozone crisis and battered global economy have increased reluctance to commit to more financially onerous cuts by the end of the decade, delegates told Reuters.Last year's U.N. climate talks in Durban, South Africa, agreed to develop a new protocol, legal instrument or legally binding deal by 2015 which would apply to all parties under the U.N.'s climate convention and would come into force no later than 2020.Countries had already agreed in 2010 that deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts had to be made to keep a rise in global average temperature below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century to avoid more extreme weather, glacier melts, ocean acidification and other harmful impacts.But efforts so far to cut emissions are not seen as sufficient to stop a rise beyond two degrees this century.\"The ambition gap must be closed..in Doha,\" said Sai Navoti, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, referring to talks scheduled for November-December in Qatar.\"Failing to close the gap immediately will lead to sginificant risks across various tipping points and global average temperature exceeding 3.5 degrees,\" he added.Last November, the U.N. Environment Programme issued a report showing that the gap between current emissions cut pledges and what is needed to limit global warming is wider than ever, growing from 5-9 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2010 to 6-11 gigatonnes in 2011.UNDER PRESSURECurrent pledges cover around 80 to 85 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and nine economies among the world's top 30 emitters in 2005 have not yet tabled cuts, said Justin Lee, head of Australia's climate delegation.\"The shared collective efforts are not enough to meet the two degree goal. Countries that haven't yet pledged, should.\"The European Union has said it would cut emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 from the current 20 percent if other large emitters take on equally ambitious pledges but none have yet done so and the EU is now grappling with the rapid deterioration of the euro zone economy.\"People clearly do not want to talk about raising pledges with the global recession and euro zone about to collapse under its own weight,\" said a source who requested anonymity.Less developed countries are also under pressure to define domestic measures to cut emissions through so-called Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) but progress there too is slow due to lack of finance.Such actions could include programmes to develop renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, or the uptake of electric vehicles, for example.Although the number of NAMA initiatives has grown to 52 from 30 last year, less than five have been implemented, said a report on Monday by the German ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nature Safety and consultancy Ecofys.The greenhouse gas emissions cuts from just 13 such programmes is expected to total around 23.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2020, the report showed.\"More nations should come forward with NAMAs. It is time to ask what can be done. Nothing at all is not the right answer,\" said Kaminaga Kaminaga, negotiator for the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific Ocean.People's current ways of life on those islands, which are only 2 metres above sea level, could be under threat even if seas rose a metre this century as glaciers and ice caps melt due to global warming.\"There is no higher ground and nowhere to relocate,\" Kaminaga warned.

Truthfully, I'm accepting this award on behalf of the many wonderful stakeholders I work with each day to get more farm-fresh, healthy foods in Washington, D.C. school meals. The journey from seed-to-cafeteria tray is long and complex. My role is to shepherd the process from start to finish, and help local schools actionably transform the quality of their food. But along each step of the way there are food champions working on the ground -- those are really the folks who truly deserve this award.I grew up with cows in my backyard. My uncle owns a small farm with an assortment of pigs, chickens, fruits, vegetables and berries. But I wasn't really interested in food until I spent some time abroad in France during college, and got a glimpse of how an entire country revolves around a robust culture of food. I returned home from France after college and made my way down to Washington, D.C. to look for work.I thought I'd find myself engaging in national issues, but what I found in D.C was a broken school food system in dire need of repair. D.C. Public Schools had been churning through Food & Nutrition Services directors for years, and the director in place at the time was fired months after I arrived. Most of the food was airplane style -- pre-made meals on heat-and-serve trays with few fresh or scratch-cooked options. It's always a shocker when you stop and think about how so many kids are disconnected from the local food system. You can't blame them, when processed and well-traveled alternatives are so cheap and readily available. The first orange food most D.C. kids can think of isn't carrots -- it's Flamin' Hot Cheetos.I began listening to anyone who'd share about how the school food system worked, what changes were needed, and where the biggest gaps were. Parents, teachers, school food service staff, non-profit leaders, government officials -- everyone had a story to tell about how to get more farm-fresh, healthy options in schools. But no one was connecting the dots. I was fascinated with the complex challenge at hand. My engineering mind and my public health readied me to take it on. And looking back at my degrees in Environmental Engineering and Community Health, farm to school is also a perfect confluence of my interests in sustainability, disease prevention, and youth engagement.Unfortunately this was in the fall of 2008, at the peak of the financial meltdown. While waiting tables, staying on a relative's couch, and taking on a few internships to help pay the bills, I began tackling the issue. I researched how farm to school programs across the country were taking on some of the same problems facing D.C. The loose collaboration of stakeholders interested in school food reform became known as the D.C. Farm to School Network, and I became their fearless leader. The Capital Area Food Bank took me on board as an intern and found funding from Kaiser Permanente for a full time salary for me shortly thereafter. The rest is history!The first project I tackled was coordinating D.C. Farm to School Week. In its third iteration this year, the Week has grown to the point where each fall, over 200 schools across the city feature locally-grown farm products in school meals and engage over 5,000 students in activities like chef demonstrations and farmers-in-the-classroom. I organized a series of Farm to School Workshops designed for school food service stakeholders in the District share best practices. I launched an annual spring event called Strawberries & Salad Greens -- I'll bet you can guess what that looks like.The Network's greatest accomplishment thus far has been the implementation of a local law called the Healthy Schools Act, passed in 2010. Noted as a national model of school wellness legislation, the Act is one of the first in the country to provide financial incentives to schools that serve fresh, locally-grown products, and requires schools to educate students about the importance of where their food comes from. I worked tirelessly to help craft the legislation, assure support at City Council, secure funding, and oversee the implemention of the law.What began as one person with an ear to the ground has since blossomed into a robust and widely supported organization with an invaluable commitment to creating institutional change through healthier school food systems. The full range of my work now includes coordinating buyer-grower meetings, managing staff, leading educational programs, policy advocacy, delivering technical assistance, planning special events, presenting at conferences, representing the Network in local and national coalitions, maintaining partner relations, and managing all communication (including a website, two newsletters, and social media).Where does the D.C. Farm to School Network go from here? Well, we've switched over from the Capital Area Food Bank to a new organizational home, called Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food & Agriculture. At Arcadia we've been able to grow to a staff of two, plus two part-time folks. Not only are we cultivating sustainable, innovative, and practical relationships between farmers and schools, we're also educating the next generation of consumers that's soon to hit the American economy. We're tasked with engaging schoolchildren and their families in the farm-to-table process so there's some \"buy-in\" to this whole concept. Because it's one thing to serve healthy, farm-fresh food; it's another for kids to actually eat it! Only then will we satisfy the \"triple bottom line\" of farm to school programs -- good for the local food economy, good for child health, and good for the community.In a series of blog posts to follow, you'll meet a few of the food champions working with D.C. School to Farm Network to make D.C. school food, good food, as I highlight the seed-to-tray journey at one public charter school in Washington, D.C. Even though 85 percent of the student body is considered low-income, their passionate School Food Service Director has been able to connect the dots for healthy school meals and source all sorts of local products including pasture-raised grass-fed ground beef. And the kids dig it, due to the innovative efforts of their School Wellness Coordinator and Garden Teacher who've helped build a school culture of wellness at the school centered on food.Check out this slideshow to get a peek into a day in the D.C. Farm to School world:"}, {"title": "Are Tar Sands Pipelines Positive or Negative for Women?", "text": "Although delayed, the TransCanada Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is almost a go despite community resistance from the Canadian border to Texas refineries. Politics will determine when the pipeline will launch. Proponents argue that the pipeline will reduce U.S. dependence on Middle East oil. Opponents raise environmental concerns. But the discourse, dominated by national security, jobs, and pollution, mostly ignores oil extraction and pipeline impacts on women.Exceptions include media mentioning reports of rapes and assaults near pipelines traversing North Dakota and Montana and a pro-business lobby EthicalOil.org commercial. The commercial suggests that Canadian tar sands oil is more \"ethical\" than Saudi Arabia's which, the clip implies \"funds\" women's oppression. Environmentalists quickly condemned the commercial as a PR ploy to distract attention from TransCanada's dirty oil extraction methods. The commercial also ignores the harmful gender dynamics pervading all oil industry operations. Damaging gender effects are not just an issue in Saudi Arabia but in oil producing areas around the world, including Canada. Oil extraction and pipelines everywhere not only degrade the environment, but also often precipitate increased rates of sexual violence, sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, prostitution, and human trafficking.Gender Action, a watchdog group holding International Financial Institution (IFI) investments accountable for their gender impacts, revealed IFI-financed pipelines' unaddressed harm to women abroad. Joint Gender Action-Central and Eastern Europe Bankwatch fieldwork demonstrated tragic gender impacts of the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Export Oil Pipeline, a British Petroleum (BP)-led investment with financing from the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Our report Boom Times Blues documented that BTC displaced nearly 20,000 people from their homes. Female subsistence farmers lost land and crop income while facing blatant gender discrimination in hiring schemes. According to the report, BTC led to dramatic increases in prostitution, HIV, domestic violence, sexual harassment, and stillbirths.Similarly, Gender Action's report Broken Promises spotlighted big oil-IFI investments' damaging impacts on West African women. The Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline and West African Gas Pipelines' financing consortium, including Chevron, Exxon/Mobil, the World Bank and European Investment Bank, made huge profits while failing to protect vulnerable social groups, especially women. Based on fieldwork with Friends of the Earth groups in Cameroon, Nigeria, Togo and Ghana, Broken Promises described how the pipelines destroyed women's agriculture and fishing livelihoods; increased women's poverty and dependence on men; discriminated against women in employment as men got virtually all pipeline jobs, even office positions; and sparked increased prostitution by women desperate for income.These faraway pipelines' gender impacts are not unique. Destructive gender dynamics plague the area along the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, especially around the \"boom town\" of Williston, North Dakota. Locals claim sexual violence against women has increased since the flood of pipeline workers into temporary housing that locals call \"man camps.\" This has led locals to arm themselves: \"the Sheriff's office reports that more people have applied for concealed weapons permits this (March) than in all of 2010.\" In 2009, Alberta had Canada's highest rate of domestic violence. In 2010, Fort McMurray's single women's shelter became so overcrowded that the executive director held a three-week hunger strike to draw attention to its desperate need for greater support. Local news reports cite the town as an epicenter of HIV and sexually-transmitted infection and a hotspot for syphilis, coinciding with an uptick in prostitution.While women actually work in Canada's tar sands oil industry, according to The Dominion, women in the industry report sexual harassment, unequal pay, exclusion from higher paying jobs, and homelessness because their low income cannot cover skyrocketing housing costs triggered by the influx of oil workers.The Canadian Green Party has linked poisoned food and water resulting from Canadian tar sands oil extraction to ominous reproductive disorders in local wildlife and rare abnormally high cancer rates 11 in the human population at large, particularly among the First Nations. Some of these claims have since been contested by a panel of Canadian experts in a 400-page study.For all the above reasons, the continuing U.S. debate on the pros and cons of importing Canada's tar sands oil via Keystone XL must not only consider environmental, jobs and national interest concerns, but also economic and health impacts on women and communities.Too often, oil extraction and pipelines benefit IFIs and corporations, while local communities cope with job losses and gender-based violence. Women suffer disproportionately because of their already marginalized status, gender discrimination in jobs and decision-making, and vulnerability to poverty and violence.Anybody with a stake in the status of women should oppose pipelines like Keystone XL -- and be wary of promises that pipeline proponents unfailingly break. So-called \"ethical oil\" harms women and communities too.Elaine Zuckerman is the President of Gender Action, the only organization dedicated to holding IFI investments accountable for gender impacts."}, {"title": "6 Shockingly Polluted Beaches To Avoid", "text": "Enjoy the sun, but steer clear of the sand and water.Read more on TakePart"}, {"title": "The Bike: A Well-Rounded Invention", "text": "During one of the worst snowstorms of the century, I decided to take a stroll and enjoy the streets devoid of cars. Then, to my surprise, I saw bicycle tracks in the fresh snow. I followed them all the way to the kitchen door of an Italian restaurant, where I found the bikes chained to a street lamppost.I peaked into the kitchen and there I saw four Latino cooks working hard with frontera music blasting in the background. For those brave souls, riding their bikes was the only way of getting to work in such nasty weather conditions.For hundreds of thousands of Latinos, their bikes are essential working tools -- rain or shine, snow or sleet. All too often they are their only means of transportation in cities and towns where transit either falls short or does not even get there at all, and where buying a car is completely out of the question.During this National Bike Month we all need to acknowledge the efforts of a community of cyclists who, because of necessity, and also devotion to their families and their work, this year alone will help the country save some $4.6 billion in transportation and gas costs.A study by the League of American Cyclists reveals that from 2001 to 2009, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asian Americans took up bicycling at a faster rate than other Americans, representing 21 percent of all bike trips in the U.S. in 2009.And there are powerful economic reasons justifying these numbers. The average annual operating cost of a bicycle is $308 --versus $8,220 for the average car. Low-income families on average spend up to 55 percent of their budget on transportation, while the average American household spends only 18 percent. Thanks to alternative transportation options, such as biking, those costs can be reduced substantially.Per $1 million spent, biking and walking projects create up to 14 jobs, versus only seven generated by highway projects. Even more, for every dollar invested in biking and walking projects, we reap benefits of up to $11.80. And many of these jobs are created in sectors of the economy that employ the most Latino workers.Bikes are also sources of pleasure for Hispanic kids, especially for those who know little beyond the confines of their barrios and have never had the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors.The Sierra Club's Inner City Outings Program organizes free bike hikes for Hispanic low-income youth to explore nature. During a recent hike outside El Paso, TX, a group rode their bikes along the R\u00edo Grande and every so often they stopped to admire wild plants and animals they had never seen before. One of them, a 6-year-old who crashed and was stung by a bee, said he had the happiest day of his life.But happy days are in danger. Currently, walking and biking account for 12 percent of all trips in the U.S. Yet these means of transportation receive only 1.6 percent of federal transportation spending. What we need is for our public officials, at every level, to recognize this great urgency to make our communities more bikeable and walkable. Also, transit needs to be widely available, especially for low-income communities that cannot rely on cars for transportation.After two centuries of existence, the bike still is a very well-rounded invention. It's our protections and safeguards that cannot keep up with this brilliant idea.Javier Sierra is a Sierra Club columnist.

As Wisconsinites are learning, there\u2019s money (and misery) in sand -- and if you\u2019ve got the right kind, an oil company may soon be at your doorstep.March in Wisconsin used to mean snow on the ground, temperatures so cold that farmers worried about their cows freezing to death. But as I traveled around rural townships and villages in early March to interview people about frac-sand mining, a little-known cousin of hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking,\u201d daytime temperatures soared to nearly 80 degrees -- bizarre weather that seemed to be sending a meteorological message.In this troubling spring, Wisconsin\u2019s prairies and farmland fanned out to undulating hills that cradled the land and its people. Within their embrace, the rackety calls of geese echoed from ice-free ponds, bald eagles wheeled in the sky, and deer leaped in the brush. And for the first time in my life, I heard the thrilling warble of sandhill cranes.Yet this peaceful rural landscape is swiftly becoming part of a vast assembly line in the corporate race for the last fossil fuels on the planet. The target: the sand in the land of the cranes.Five hundred million years ago, an ocean surged here, shaping a unique wealth of hills and bluffs that, under mantles of greenery and trees, are sandstone. That sandstone contains a particularly pure form of crystalline silica. Its grains, perfectly rounded, are strong enough to resist the extreme pressures of the technology called hydraulic fracturing, which pumps vast quantities of that sand, as well as water and chemicals, into ancient shale formations to force out methane and other forms of \u201cnatural gas.\u201dThat sand, which props open fractures in the shale, has to come from somewhere. Without it, the fracking industry would grind to a halt. So big multinational corporations are descending on this bucolic region to cart off its prehistoric sand, which will later be forcefully injected into the earth elsewhere across the country to produce more natural gas. Geology that has taken millions of years to form is now being transformed into part of a system, a machine, helping to drive global climate change.\u201cThe valleys will be filled\u2026 the mountains and hills made level\"Boom times for hydraulic fracturing began in 2008 when new horizontal-drilling methods transformed an industry formerly dependent on strictly vertical boring. Frac-sand mining took off in tandem with this development.\u201cIt's huge,\u201d said a U.S. Geological Survey mineral commodity specialist in 2009. \u201cI've never seen anything like it, the growth. It makes my head spin.\" That year, from all U.S. sources, frac-sand producers used or sold over 6.5 million metric tons of sand -- about what the Great Pyramid of Giza weighs. Last month, Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Senior Manager and Special Projects Coordinator Tom Woletz said corporations were hauling at least 15 million metric tons a year from the state\u2019s hills.By July 2011, between 22 and 36 frac-sand facilities in Wisconsin were either operating or approved. Seven months later, said Woletz, there were over 60 mines and 45 processing (refinement) plants in operation. \u201cBy the time your article appears, these figures will be obsolete,\u201d claims Pat Popple, who in 2008 founded the first group to oppose frac-sand mining, Concerned Chippewa Citizens (now part of The Save the Hills Alliance).Jerry Lausted, a retired teacher and also a farmer, showed me the tawny ridges of sand that delineated a strip mine near the town of Menomonie where he lives. \u201cIf we were looking from the air,\u201d he added, \u201cyou\u2019d see ponds in the bottom of the mine where they dump the industrial waste water. If you scan to the left, you\u2019ll see the hills that are going to disappear.\u201dThose hills are gigantic sponges, absorbing water, filtering it, and providing the region\u2019s aquifer with the purest water imaginable. According to Lausted, sand mining takes its toll on \u201cair quality, water quality and quantity. Recreational aspects of the community are damaged. Property values [are lowered.] But the big thing is, you\u2019re removing the hills that you can\u2019t replace. They\u2019re a huge water manufacturing factory that Mother Nature gave us, and they\u2019re gone.\u201dIt\u2019s impossible to grasp the scope of the devastation from the road, but aerial videos and photographs reveal vast, bleak sandy wastelands punctuated with waste ponds and industrial installations where Wisconsin hills once stood.When corporations apply to counties for mining permits, they must file \u201creclamation\u201d plans. But Larry Schneider, a retired metallurgist and industrial consultant with a specialized knowledge of mining, calls the reclamation process \u201can absolute farce.\u201dReclamation projects by mining corporations since the 1970s may have made mined areas \u201clook a little less than an absolute wasteland,\u201d he observes. \u201cBut did they reintroduce the biodiversity? Did they reintroduce the beauty and the ecology? No.\u201dStudies bear out his verdict. \u201cEvery year,\u201d wrote Mrinal Ghose in the Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, \u201clarge areas are continually becoming unfertile in spite of efforts to grow vegetation on the degraded mined land.\u201dAwash in promises of corporate jobs and easy money, those who lease and sell their land just shrug. \u201cThe landscape is gonna change when it\u2019s all said and done,\u201d says dairy farmer Bobby Schindler, who in 2008 leased his land in Chippewa County to a frac-sand company called Canadian Sand and Proppant. (EOG, the former Enron, has since taken over the lease.) \u201cInstead of being a hill it\u2019s gonna be a valley, but all seeded down, and you\u2019d never know there\u2019s a mine there unless you were familiar with the area.\u201dOf the mining he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s really put a boost to the area. It\u2019s impressive the amount of money that\u2019s exchanging hands.\u201d Eighty-four-year-old Letha Webster, who sold her land 100 miles south of Schindler\u2019s to another mining corporation, Unimin, says that leaving her home of 56 years is \u201cjust the price of progress.\u201dJamie and Kevin Gregar -- both 30-something native Wisconsinites and military veterans -- lived in a trailer and saved their money so that they could settle down in a pastoral paradise once Kevin returned from Iraq. In January 2011, they found a dream home near tiny Tunnel City. (The village takes its name from a nearby rail tunnel). \u201cIt\u2019s just gorgeous -- the hills, the trees, the woodland, the animals,\u201d says Jamie. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201dFive months after they moved in, she learned that neighbors had leased their land to \u201ca sand mine\u201d company. \u201cWhat\u2019s a sand mine?\u201d she asked.Less than a year later, they know all too well. The Gregars\u2019 land is now surrounded on three sides by an unsightly panorama of mining preparations. Unimin is uprooting trees, gouging out topsoil, and tearing down the nearby hills. \u201cIt looks like a disaster zone, like a bomb went off,\u201d Jamie tells me.When I mention her service to her country, her voice breaks. \u201cI am devastated. We\u2019ve done everything right. We\u2019ve done everything we were supposed to. We just wanted to raise our family in a good location and have good neighbors and to have it taken away from us for something we don\u2019t support\u2026\u201d Her voice trails off in tears.For Unimin, the village of Tunnel City in Greenfield township was a perfect target. Not only did the land contain the coveted crystalline silica; it was close to a rail spur. No need for the hundreds of diesel trucks that other corporations use to haul sand from mine sites to processing plants. No need, either, for transport from processing plants to rail junctions where hundreds of trains haul frac-sand by the millions of tons each year to fracture other once-rural landscapes. Here, instead, the entire assembly line operates in one industrial zone.There was also no need for jumping the hurdles zoning laws sometimes erect. Like many Wisconsin towns where a culture of diehard individualism sees zoning as an assault on personal freedom, Greenfield and all its municipalities, including Tunnel City, are unzoned. This allowed the corporation to make deals with individual landowners. For the 8.5 acres where Letha Webster and her husband Gene lived for 56 years, assessed in 2010 at $147,500, Unimin paid $330,000. Overall, between late May and July 2011, it paid $5.3 million for 436 acres with a market value of about $1.1 million.There was no time for public education about the potential negative possibilities of frac-sand mining: the destruction of the hills, the decline in property values, the danger of silicosis (once considered a strictly occupational lung disease) from blowing silica dust, contamination of ground water from the chemicals used in the processing plants, the blaze of lights all night long, noise from hundreds of train cars, houses shaken by blasting. Ron Koshoshek, a leading environmentalist who works with Wisconsin\u2019s powerful Towns Association to educate townships about the industry, says that \u201cfrac-sand mining will virtually end all residential development in rural townships.\u201d The result will be \u201ca large-scale net loss of tax dollars to towns, increasing taxes for those who remain.\u201dTown-Busting TacticsFrac-sand corporations count on a combination of na\u00efvet\u00e9, trust, and incomprehension in rural hamlets that previously dealt with companies no larger than Wisconsin\u2019s local sand and gravel industries. Before 2008, town boards had never handled anything beyond road maintenance and other basic municipal issues. Today, multinational corporations use their considerable resources to steamroll local councils and win sweetheart deals. That\u2019s how the residents of Tunnel City got taken to the cleaners.On July 6, 2011, a Unimin representative ran the first public forum about frac-sand mining in the village. Other heavily attended and often heated community meetings followed, but given the cascades of cash, the town board chairman\u2019s failure to take a stand against the mining corporation, and Unimin\u2019s aggressiveness, tiny Tunnel City was a David without a slingshot.Local citizens did manage to get the corporation to agree to give the town $250,000 for the first two million tons mined annually, $50,000 more than its original offer. In exchange, the township agreed that any ordinance it might pass in the future to restrict mining wouldn\u2019t apply to Unimin. Multiply the two million tons of frac-sand tonnage Unimin expects to mine annually starting in 2013 by the $300 a ton the industry makes and you\u2019ll find that the township only gets .0004 percent of what the company will gross.For the Gregars, it\u2019s been a nightmare. Unimin has refused five times to buy their land and no one else wants to live near a sand mine. What weighs most heavily on the couple is the possibility that their children will get silicosis from long-term exposure to dust from the mine sites. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our kids to be lab rats for frac-sand mining companies,\u201d says Jamie.Drew Bradley, Unimin\u2019s senior vice president of operations, waves such fears aside. \u201cI think [citizens] are blowing it out of proportion,\u201d he told a local publication. \u201cThere are plenty of silica mines sited close to communities. There have been no concerns exposed there.\u201dThat\u2019s cold comfort to the Gregars. Crystalline silica is a known carcinogen and the cause of silicosis, an irreversible, incurable disease. None of the very few rules applied to sand mining by the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) limit how much silica gets into the air outside of mines. That\u2019s the main concern of those living near the facilities.So in November 2011, Jamie Gregar and ten other citizens sent a 35-page petition to the DNR. The petitioners asked the agency to declare respirable crystalline silica a hazardous substance and to monitor it, using a public health protection level set by California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. The petition relies on studies, including one by the DNR itself, which acknowledge the risk of airborne silica from frac-sand mines for those who live nearby.The DNR denied the petition, claiming among other things that -- contrary to its own study\u2019s findings -- current standards are adequate. One of the petition\u2019s signatories, Ron Koshoshek, wasn\u2019t surprised. For 16 years he was a member of, and for nine years chaired, Wisconsin\u2019s Public Intervenor Citizens Advisory Committee. Created in 1967, its role was to intercede on behalf of the environment, should tensions grow between the DNR\u2019s two roles: environmental protector and corporate licensor. \u201cThe DNR,\u201d he says, \u201cis now a permitting agency for development and exploitation of resources.\u201dIn 2010, Cathy Stepp, a confirmed anti-environmentalist who had previously railed against the DNR, belittling it as \"anti-development, anti-transportation, and pro-garter snakes,\" was appointed to head the agency by now-embattled Governor Scott Walker who explained: \u201cI wanted someone with a chamber-of-commerce mentality.\u201dAs for Jamie Gregar, her dreams have been dashed and she\u2019s determined to leave her home. \u201cAt this point,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a price we wouldn\u2019t accept.\u201dFrac-Sand vs. FoodBrian Norberg and his family in Prairie Farm, 137 miles northwest of Tunnel City, paid the ultimate price: he died while trying to mobilize the community against Procore, a subsidiary of the multinational oil and gas corporation Sanjel. The American flag that flies in front of the Norbergs\u2019 house flanks a placard with a large, golden NORBERG, over which pheasants fly against a blue sky. It\u2019s meant to represent the 1,500 acres the family has farmed for a century.\u201cWhen you start talking about industrial mining, to us, you\u2019re violating the land,\u201d Brian\u2019s widow, Lisa, told me one March afternoon over lunch. She and other members of the family, as well as a friend, had gathered to describe Prairie Farm\u2019s battle with the frac-sanders. \u201cThe family has had a really hard time accepting the fact that what we consider a beautiful way to live could be destroyed by big industry.\u201dTheir fight against Procore started in April 2011: Sandy, a lifelong friend and neighbor, arrived with sand samples drillers had excavated from her land, and began enthusiastically describing the benefits of frac-sand mining. \u201cBrian listened for a few minutes,\u201d Lisa recalls. \u201cThen he told her [that]\u2026 she and her sand vials could get the heck -- that\u2019s a much nicer word than what he used -- off the farm. Sandy was hoping we would also be excited about jumping on the bandwagon. Brian informed her that our land would be used for the purpose God intended, farming.\u201dBrian quickly enlisted family and neighbors in an organizing effort against the company. In June 2011, Procore filed a reclamation plan -- the first step in the permitting process -- with the county\u2019s land and water conservation department. Brian rushed to the county office to request a public hearing, but returned dejected and depressed. \u201cHe felt completely defeated that he could not protect the community from them moving in and destroying our lives,\u201d recalls Lisa.He died of a heart attack less than a day later at the age of 52. The family is convinced his death was a result of the stress caused by the conflict. That stress is certainly all too real. The frac-sand companies, says family friend Donna Goodlaxson, echoing many others I interviewed for this story, \u201cgo from community to community. And one of the things they try to do is pit people in the community against each other.\u201dInstead of backing off, the Norbergs and other Prairie Farm residents continued Brian\u2019s efforts. At an August 2011 public hearing, the town\u2019s residents directly addressed Procore\u2019s representatives. \u201cWhat people had to say there was so powerful,\u201d Goodlaxson remembers. \u201cThose guys were blown out of their chairs. They weren\u2019t prepared for us.\u201d\u201cI think people insinuate that we\u2019re little farmers in a little community and everyone\u2019s an ignorant buffoon,\u201d added Sue Glaser, domestic partner of Brian\u2019s brother Wayne. \u201cThey found out in a real short time there was a lot of education behind this.\u201d\u201cAbout 80 percent of the neighborhood was not happy about the potential change to our area,\u201d Lisa adds. \u201cBut very few of us knew anything about this industry at [that] time.\u201d To that end, Wisconsin\u2019s Farmers\u2019 Union and its Towns Association organized a day-long conference in December 2011 to help people \u201cdeal with this new industry.\u201dMeanwhile, other towns, alarmed by the explosion of frac-sand mining, were beginning to pass licensing ordinances to regulate the industry. In Wisconsin, counties can challenge zoning but not licensing ordinances, which fall under town police powers. These, according to Wisconsin law, cannot be overruled by counties or the state. Becky Glass, a Prairie Farm resident and an organizer with Labor Network for Sustainability, calls Wisconsin\u2019s town police powers \u201cthe strongest tools towns have to fight or regulate frac-sand mining.\u201d Consider them so many slingshots employed against the corporate Goliaths.In April 2012, Prairie Farm\u2019s three-man board voted 2 to 1 to pass such an ordinance to regulate any future mining effort in the town. No, such moves won\u2019t stop frac-sand mining in Wisconsin, but they may at least mitigate its harm. Procore finally pulled out because of the resistance, says Glass, adding that the company has since returned with different personnel to try opening a mine near where she lives.\u201cIt takes 1.2 acres per person per year to feed every person in this country,\u201d says Lisa Norberg. \u201cAnd the little township that I live in, we have 9,000 acres that are for farm use. So if we just close our eyes and bend over and let the mining companies come in, we\u2019ll have thousands of people we can\u2019t feed.\u201dFood or frac-sand: it\u2019s a decision of vital importance across the country, but one most Americans don\u2019t even realize is being made -- largely by multinational corporations and dwindling numbers of yeoman farmers in what some in this country would call \u201cthe real America.\u201d Most of us know nothing about these choices, but if the mining corporations have their way, we will soon enough -- when we check out prices at the supermarket or grocery store. We\u2019ll know it too, as global climate change continues to turn Wisconsin winters balmy and supercharge wild weather across the country.While bucolic landscapes disappear, aquifers are fouled, and countless farms across rural Wisconsin morph into industrial wastelands, Lisa\u2019s sons continue to work the Norberg\u2019s land, just as their father once did. So does Brian\u2019s nephew, 32-year-old Matthew, who took me on a jolting ride across his fields. The next time I\u2019m in town, he assured me, we\u2019ll visit places in the hills where water feeds into springs. Yes, you can drink the water there. It\u2019s still the purest imaginable. Under the circumstances, though, no one knows for how long.Ellen Cantarow\u2019s work on Israel/Palestine has been widely published for over 30 years.

Like something out of Dumas, the passionate infighting stretched back decades. The industry effort was spearheaded by Democratic Commissioner Bill Magwood. Magwood, it turned out, had led a strikingly similar coup against his boss at the Department of Energy before taking his spot, a saga first reported by HuffPost late last year as the coup was unfolding.Magwood's ally at the time was Alex Flint, then a GOP Senate staffer who took the lead on nuclear policy. He's now the top lobbyist for the nuclear industry -- whose criticism of Jaczko coincided with Magwood's dramatic assault.Jaczko and the pro-industry commissioners clashed over his opposition to using Nevada's Yucca Mountain as a depository for nuclear waste. The commissioners further accused him of heavy-handed leadership when he put the NRC on emergency footing following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. They argued that he was pushing forward too fast with costly new safety regulations.HuffPost reported that Magwood, who spent his career moving in and out of the private sector, had done nuclear safety consulting for the company that owns the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Magwood confirmed the consulting work during Senate testimony, but said that his connections have not influenced his decision-making.Jaczko, with the help of Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), his Senate patron, Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), his former boss in the House, and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chair of the environment and public works committee, staved off the threat to his position in the face of multiple demands from the GOP that he resign. The White House, meanwhile, stood by Jaczko, with then-Chief of Staff Bill Daley suggesting the equivalent of couples counseling.But on Monday, Jaczko called it quits. \"After nearly eight years on the Commission, I am announcing my resignation as Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, effective upon the confirmation of my successor. My responsibility and commitment to safety will continue to be my paramount priority after I leave the Commission and until my successor is confirmed,\" he said.\"I thank Chairman Jaczko for always fighting for the health and safety of the American people,\" Boxer said in a statement. \"I look forward to the President\u2019s nomination of a successor that will carry the same level of concern in this post-Fukushima era.\"Reid, meanwhile, said Jaczko \"dedicated his tenure to improving the safety of nuclear energy, and his leadership during the Fukushima nuclear crisis protected millions of Americans. His work toward a safe and effective nuclear energy policy has left Nevada and the nation more secure.\"In an interview with HuffPost, Jaczko declined to endorse either of the two Democrats on the panel for re-nomination, saying that the decision would be made by others.The battle against Jaczko reveals the flip-side of corporate influence on politics. While the traditional understanding of money in politics has to do with favors and rewards, it works in reverse, too: Act against corporate interests, and become a target for personal destruction.Magwood publicly accused Jaczko of abusive behavior toward women, charges that were never backed up, and were mocked by Boxer as \"McCarthyist\" in their lack of specificity.\"This is the ugly underbelly of large corporate lobbying,\" said a former Democratic staffer, who has worked with the men at the center of both controversies and is now a corporate lobbyist himself, in December. \"It really is by any means necessary.\"Jaczko, by announcing his resignation several months after the attempted coup, has likely put an end to the attack. His term was set to expire in June 2013, and given the controversy, it wouldn't have been difficult for the GOP to bottle up his re-appointment.The move gives the White House time to appoint its own nominee. That decision will likely be left to Reid, however, who is a strident opponent of turning Yucca Mountain into a waste depository.\"I am confident whomever replaces Chairman Jaczko will share his commitment to protecting the safety of the American people over the interests of a single industry. This is an opportunity for the nuclear industry to demonstrate its commitment to public safety by supporting a Chairperson who puts the safety of American citizens first,\" Reid said.\"Greg was my trusted aide for many years and his talent in applying science to public policy was an asset to my staff and the state of Nevada,\" Reid added. \"I wish him well in his future endeavors.\"The Nuclear Energy Institute, the lobbying arm of the nuclear industry, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Jaczko's resignation.A separate former senior Democratic aide who has worked with Jaczko, Magwood and Flint said that Yucca was the impetus for the industry's opposition to the outgoing chairman. Magwood \"and the industry hate Greg because they think he was put on the commission by Reid, who's anti-Yucca, and he's gonna be a Reid stooge. And you know what? They're f*cking right,\" the former aide said. \"That's exactly why he was put on there. But that commission and that agency were complete and total captives of the nuclear industry. One and the same.\"UPDATE: 11:55 a.m. -- Other members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works weighed in on Jaczko's resignation shortly after it was announced.Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the committee's ranking member, said, \"Throughout his time at the NRC, it was abundantly clear that Chairman Jaczko used his office to undermine the NRC to the point that all four of his fellow commissioners wrote to the President to ask for assistance as a last resort. With his resignation today, the NRC can focus on its mission of safety without the distractions of Jaczko's inappropriate behavior.\"Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who also sits on the committee, praised Jaczko's efforts. \"Chairman Jaczko has served the interests of the public extremely well on the commission,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"He has a consistent voting record supporting the swift implementation of strong safety reforms.\"Sanders added, \"For his efforts to hold the nuclear industry accountable, Chairman Jaczko was subjected to repeated personal attacks made by some of his colleagues and pro-industry advocates in Congress. I am extremely disappointed he is leaving the Commission.\"CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Barbara Boxer is a senator from Massachusetts; she in fact represents California."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: The Vegucation of Marisa Miller Wolfson", "text": "The writer, director, editor of the documentary Vegucated did not descend \"from the planet Vega to convert the mere earthling.\" Marisa Miller Wolfson started out as a midwest girl with a fondness for bacon. Along the way, she became \"a professional eco-nudger\" and dedicated vegan. How? \"It didn't take much,\" Wolfson recalls. It took seeing a film about \"the horrors of industrial agriculture.\"Wolfson's heart and mind were set. But she still had to go through a vegan learning curve, her vegucation, from how to stock her refrigerator to dealing with being called \"a plastic shoe-wearing radical.\" By her mother.   Vegucated distills these and other challenges for three New Yorkers over six weeks as they try to go vegan in a country \"that's not quite ready for that.\"Wolfson used the 2004 fast food documentary Supersize Me as a template, with Morgan Spurlock \"putting himself through this experiment and we all get to watch.\" With Ellen, Brian and Tesla, Vegucated's cast, \"we didn't know what these guys would do. We took a risk.\" A big risk. Wolfson had no prior film experience. Neither did Mary Max, Vegucated's executive producer and the founder of the eco-nonprofit Kind Green Planet.   Filmmaking requires its own learning curve and the road to Vegucated was potholed with logistical nightmares and \"helpful, yet painful feedback.\" Wolfson sighs. \"If I had known what I would have to go through to make this happen, I don't know if I would have done it. Thank goodness I didn't know.\"   Vegucated has become a digital bestseller and Wolfson treasures every tweet and e-mail from people who've seen the film and \"are making a change as a result. It's the most exciting part.\"The hardest part? For Wolfson, for the cast and for her audience, \"What really hit them in the gut and make a change is the animal component.\" Vegucated's tipping point comes after her cast visits a farm. Wolfson focuses on their grim faces on their drive home. Their horror, their disbelief is as powerful as the in-your-face animal cruelty footage that convinced Wolfson to go vegan.She screened Vegucated in her home town, within an hour's radius of 84 factory farms. \"It's cow country, that's the culture,\" she says. \"There was none of the defensiveness I had expected. People have been really responsive.\" That includes her family. \"I can tell I'm hitting past the vegan choir.\"The vegan choir, in fact, has been giving some pushback. \"Some of the vegan community are disappointed at the end when everyone's not a hundred percent vegan.\" Wolfson shrugs. \"It was not at all a surprise that Tesla had a struggle, that she still has struggles. It reflects truth, reality, for a lot of people. I was thrilled everyone stuck with it for six weeks. I'm more about celebrating the victories than criticizing the shortcomings.\"Wolfson wants to celebrate your victories, too. She's launching the Vegucated Challenge, an e-mail coaching program for anyone looking to make the switch to a plant-based diet. Like PCRM's Vegan Kickstart, it provides daily e-mail tips and support, not just from Wolfson but from other members of the vegan community. We can all help -- and vegucate -- each other.One of Wolfson's favorite tips? Embrace the new. \"Instead of thinking, I can't have this or that, think of exciting things you get to try. I had never had kale or quinoa -- they're my favorites now. Even if you're not ready to go vegetarian, just start eating the new stuff and naturally, you'll start eating less of the animal stuff.\"\"Some people say it's crazy and I could never do that, it's too extreme,\" says Wolfson. \"If you had a good enough reason, you could do anything.\"Vegucational Kale and Quinoa"}, {"title": "Saola, 'Asian Unicorn,' Faces Extinction", "text": "Andrea Mustain, OurAmazingPlanet Staff Writer  This month marks the 20th anniversary of a spectacular day for zoologists. Two decades ago, in May 1992, scientists announced the discovery of a new species \u2014 the saola \u2014 living in the lush mountain forests that straddle the Vietnam-Laos border.It was the first large mammal discovered since the 1930s.Yet celebrations are muted in light of the elusive species' plight; the saola, also known as the \"Asian unicorn,\" is likely fast disappearing, conservationists warned in an announcement today, and they say there could be only 200, or even as few as just several dozen of the animals left on the planet.The saola is a small, horned animal that resembles a strange antelope hybrid, but is more closely related to a type of wild cow.Vietnamese scientists first identified the new species only through the bizarre, horned skulls that villagers living near the animal's range had collected.Stark markings on the face, long, graceful horns and a tufted tail lend to the animal's mystique. [See rare photos of saola.]But according to Barney Long, an Asian species expert for the conservation organization WWF, the creature got its mythical moniker more for its habits than its looks.\"It's so rare to see that it would almost be like seeing a unicorn,\" Long told OurAmazingPlanet in 2011, when a protected area for saola was created in Vietnam.These secretive ungulates wander the steamy green forests of South Asia's Annamite Mountains, where poaching is rampant. Although saola themselves are not prized in the wildlife trade or for their meat, many of their neighbors are.\"Saola are caught largely as bycatch \u2014 like the tuna and dolphin scenario,\" William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group, said in a statement.And although the rare creatures are caught and killed by snares, scientists have never observed them in the wild. The rare saola that has been captured alive has quickly died.\"When they're in captivity, they seem to act extremely tame, and they're very open to having people come up to them and touch them,\" Long said, but explained that their sweet demeanor is likely a sign of extreme stress. \"The animal is freaking out,\" he said.Conservationists said it's encouraging that saola are not a direct target for poachers, and offered hope that the critically endangered animals can be saved.\"But we still need to act,\" Robichaud said. \"One of the rarest and most distinctive large animals in the world has been quietly slipping toward extinction through complacency.\"Reach Andrea Mustain at amustain@techmedianetwork.com.

Global Witness calls Cambodia a 'country for sale', and according to a recent USAID report, without urgent action, Prey Lang, the largest evergreen lowland forest in Southeast Asia and home to an estimated 200,000 indigenous people, will be completely destroyed in 2-3 years.Wanting to understand the effect that deforestation was having on the environment and indigenous communities, I traveled through Prey Lang for six days in February on motorbike, photographing both the harmonious relationship these communities have with the forest, and how that way of life is quickly slipping away. We stayed in the forest homes of members of the Prey Lang Network, a grassroots association of villagers risking their lives to try and slow the destruction of their forest.The danger to these activists became all too real on April 26, 2012, when one of our guides, Chut Wutty, a leading activist for the protection of Prey Lang, was shot dead by Cambodian Military Police as he was working with journalists to expose illegal logging activities in another threatened region of Cambodia. After publishing three conflicting accounts of his death, the government has closed their investigation into the shooting, despite continued calls by local activists and international NGOs, including the UN, for a more transparent investigation.Responding to international pressures and attention, the Prime Minister of Cambodia has suspended the economic land concessions that Wutty was fighting against, but activists believe this is only a political maneuver, one that will be quickly reversed as soon as international eyes have turned away. So protests over the government's existing land concessions continue; just days ago a 14-year-old girl was killed by military police trying to evict rural Cambodians from their land.When once the activists would have been intimidated by the action of the military, this time they are standing up and rallying around a cry that \"it's our forest too\" and \"we are all Wutty.\"All photos by Mathieu Young"}, {"title": "Gorilla Pictures: Photos Of Majestic Apes And Adorable Babies", "text": "Whether you enjoy pictures of mighty adult apes or their tiny and adorable offspring, it is most important to recognize that gorillas are endangered.

Here are the video entries from Week 7:Renewable Rider Tom Weis has a no holds barred conversation with Karl Connell, a rancher from Newport, NE, who has much to say about TransCanada and Nebraska's Legislature. Karl explains the threats posed to his land, livestock and family from contaminated runoff, oil spills, blowouts and explosions. He shares a Material Safety Data Sheet listing the dangerous chemical composition of tar sands crude oil. He also shares a photo documenting TransCanada's pre-construction of a nearby pumping station, despite not having been granted permission to build. He says he has been treated \"like shit\" by the company, which is threatening to steal his private property through eminent domain. Calling the behavior of Nebraska Senators \"disgusting,\" he suggests some have been \"bought and sold by TransCanada.\"Renewable Rider Tom Weis hears third generation rancher Susan Luebbe draw a line in the sand against Keystone XL, which would come within 200 yards of her home. Susan describes TransCanada's land agents as \"not friendly at all,\" saying they lied to her right off the bat. She says she will not allow Canada to take away their land and will defend it \"no matter what.\"Renewable Rider Tom Weis hears rancher Ernie Fellows from Mills, NE describe how Keystone XL, which would come within 300 yards of his home, violates amendments to the U.S. Constitution. He charges the company obtained illegal easements, saying land agents lied to him and are taking advantage of the elderly. Saying he never considered himself an \"environmentalist\" until now, Ernie recounts how Nebraska senators have disrespected citizens and how \"this whole thing speaks of money, graft, corruption, under the table payments...\"Renewable Rider Tom Weis and Ron Seifert team up with Occupy Lincoln in Nebraska. After forming a human \"line in the sand\" against Keystone XL on the steps of the capitol, about 100 marchers and bikers snaked their way through downtown Lincoln. Recognizing that TransCanada is a poster child for how greedy, corrupt corporations are dominating the other 99%, the group made an exception to their general rule of no issue-specific politics by explicitly opposing the tar sands pipeline.Renewable Rider Tom Weis listens to Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy and Oil Pipelines for TransCanada, talk about the company's planned reroute around Nebraska's Sandhills at a November press conference in Lincoln, NE. Contrary to numerous media accounts, Mr. Pourbaix clearly states the company's proposed Keystone XL reroute is NOT designed to avoid the Ogallala Aquifer -- the drinking water supply of millions of Americans and source of one-third of our nation's farmland irrigation water -- leaving this critical U.S. resource exposed to toxic tar sands pipeline leaks.Renewable Rider Tom Weis talks with Ron Seifert after he races, and beats, a coal train.

For good reason, federal law mandates that a physician or medical researcher must inform her patient about all potential risks and benefits before an invasive procedure. The patient must sign a consent form. These processes of informed consent were developed in the wake of atrocious 20th-century moral failings in medical research such as Nazi medical experimentation and the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study.  The rise of informed consent for invasive procedures demonstrates that, as a society, we take moral considerations seriously. And it is through federal regulation that these moral insights become legal requirements.  So it's a pity that our federal regulations for the invasive procedure of hydraulic fracturing continue to fall so short.   On May 4, the Obama administration announced a \"compromise\" on procedures for extracting natural gas via horizontal hydraulic fracturing on public lands.   What's new about the rule? Among other things, the requirement that energy companies disclose what's in the mysterious fracking solution. This is a happy, if infinitesimal, improvement from the previous status quo, in which non-disclosure ruled the day. (The federal government has taken a cue from historically conservative states -- such as Wyoming and North Dakota -- that require disclosure of fracking chemicals.)  But under the new federal rule, disclosure of fracking chemicals will happen only after the well has been drilled and extraction has begun.   What?  In a nutshell: Drill first, disclose later.  It is almost always in the interests of the powerful to act first and apologize later. What's unfortunate is that the new federal regulation enshrines this as official policy.  It's especially galling since a previous draft of the rule mandated 30 days' disclosure in advance of drilling. Of course, that draft requirement was roundly lambasted by oil and gas interests for being expensive and inefficient.  Accordingly, the \"act first, apologize later\" approach enshrined in the new rule is lauded by industry as \"efficient.\"  But morally, it's adolescent. Withholding relevant information is dangerous and duplicitous. Acting first and apologizing later wasn't enough for the men in the Tuskegee study. It's not enough here, either.  The body politic needs to be informed about all chemical contents used in fracking solutions -- before they are injected at high volume and pressure into the land below us. According to an April 2011 report by the Minority Staff of the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, often used in fracking are \"29 chemicals that are (1) known or possible human carcinogens, (2) regulated under Safe Drinking Water Act for their risks to human health, or (3) listed as hazardous pollutants under the Clean Air Act.\"  People have a right to know -- in advance -- what chemicals are being used, the exact sites of usage, short and long term toxicological and environmental effects, and -- not least -- the current limitations of our knowledge. As the history of medical informed consent points out, it's what we're not told that tends to be the problem.  Yes, the requirement of informed consent can be onerous. When informed consent regulations for medicine were first introduced, many people warned that it would be costly and inefficient.  The same rhetoric spews out of oil and gas interests about advance disclosure of fracking chemicals. And history shows that taking precautions and fully disclosing potential risks isn't always the most efficient or profitable in the short term.   But history also shows that it's the right thing to do -- and it's the government's job to make sure the right kinds of protections are in place, particularly when it comes to possible effects on human health.  All we're asking is the fundamental freedom to know our poison before we drink it."}, {"title": "Gas, Break, Pedal: A New Way To Cycle", "text": "By: Denise TejadaWith just a ten millimeter wrench and a screwdriver, Brian Simmons has built and sold more than 100 motorized bicycles in Oakland, CA, under the label Rebelbikes.

The company expects to begin production in the second half of 2012 and turn wood products into components, or blendstocks, that can be used in gasoline and diesel fuel.The KiOR plant will process farmed Southern Yellow Pine trees at the equivalent of about $25 per barrel of oil, or about one-quarter the price U.S. crude oil.Nearly 400 million gallons of new biofuels production is expected to go on line this year in the United States, according to data compiled by industry publication Biofuels Digest.Another 1.7 billion gallons of additional capacity is forecast to start up from the beginning of 2013 through 2015, bringing total capacity to nearly 2.3 billion gallons.Among others under construction are Altair's Washington plant, which will produce jet fuel from carmelina, an oily flowering plant; and Diamond Green's facility in Louisiana, which will convert animal fat and used cooking oil into diesel fuel under a joint venture with refiner Valero Energy Corp .Many of the nascent biofuels companies have been working for years to develop technology that can cheaply turn cellulosic sugars or waste materials into energy and have even attracted investment from the world's top oil companies.Those advances have come in several areas. Researchers have developed new biochemical catalysts to break down tough cellulosic material, used new techniques to turn solid materials into gas and created advanced 'hydroprocessing' refining methods to break heavy hydrocarbons into lighter, more easily burned fuels.BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corp and Total SA have all taken stakes in companies that focus on a wide variety of fuels from traditional sugar cane ethanol to gasoline and diesel.Still other companies, including Gevo Inc and Butamax, a joint venture of BP Plc and Dupont, are building plants to produce biobutanol from corn starches or other agricultural products to produce 'drop-in' components for gasoline or chemicals with a higher energy content than traditional ethanol.\"I think there's room for multiple fuels to contribute to the fuel mix,\" Butamax CEO Paul Beckwith said in an interview.Gevo, which is locked in a patent lawsuit with Butamax, expects to start up a converted ethanol plant next month that will produce butanol using corn cellulose as a feedstock. It expects to shift to materials such as switch grass, waste wood products or agricultural by-products such as corn cobs and stalks and sugarcane bagasse in the future.INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE PATIENTAuthorized under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the Environmental Protection Agency's Renewable Fuel Standard 2 calls for 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels to be delivered annually by 2022, on top of a target of 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol.The advanced biofuels target could be reduced if producers fail to bring adequate production on line and oil industry lobby group the American Petroleum Institute has already filed a lawsuit challenging the goal as unrealistically high.Companies that are required under the EPA rules to buy biofuels to meet the target can instead purchase credits based on actual volumes produced through the Renewable Identification Number system, or RINs. While not a direct subsidy, those RINs can be worth between about $2 to $5 per gallon for biofuel producers, although the RIN market remains in its infancy.A separate $1.01 gallon subsidy for cellulosic biofuels is set to expire at the end of this year and industry experts do not expect the U.S. Congress to extend that incentive. So far, its impact has been modest because fuels that would qualify for it have only been produced in low volumes.With a capacity of 62.5 million gallons per year, KiOR's $222 million Columbus plant will be the largest of its kind in the United States and is expected to produce fuel at about $1.10 per gallon, well below the current NYMEX wholesale gasoline price of nearly $3 per gallon.KiOR has already sold the planned output from the plant to Hunt Refining, FedEx Corp and Catchlight Energy, a joint venture between Chevron and forest products company Weyerhaeuser Co.KiOR and others such as Codexis Inc, Amyris Inc , Solazyme Inc and Renewable Energy Group Inc have all successfully tapped into the public markets, although their shares have all fallen below their launch prices.Given the diverse slate of fuels, feedstocks and company strategies in the industry, investors may need to be patient to see which companies emerge as the best in the sector.\"We're still very early from an investment perspective of picking winners,\" Cowen said.Another 300 companies are trying to develop technology to break into the market, according to Mike Ritzenthaler, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, with perhaps 20 of those potentially on track to seek IPOs in the next few years.\"All of these guys are looking for money,\" Ritzenthaler said.Still, Canadian-based Enerkem's move to pull its planned $138 million IPO showed that Wall Street may be growing wary of pouring new money into the sector.Investors viewed Enerkem's municipal solid waste-to-biofuels technology as too risky because it has never been shown to work in large quantities and the company forecast its losses would grow as it sought to build production plants.\"Early on, investors were willing to look out four or more years, but now they want to see positive EBITDA,\" Ritzenthaler said.Enerkem said in its filings that it planned to make bioethanol at $1.50 to $1.70 per gallon, although analysts feared the company's cheap waste feedstocks could grow scarce if competitors emerged.Still, several other companies have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for public stock offerings, including Genomatica, Myriant, Mascoma Corp, Coskata, Fulcrum Bioenergy, BioAmber and Elevance Renewable Sciences Inc.Mascoma, which has received financial backing from Valero Energy, Marathon Oil Corp and a General Motors Co investment fund, has said it was targeting operating costs of $1.77 per gallon for ethanol produced from hardwood.Coskata, backed by France's Total, expects a commercial plant in Alabama to produce fuel-grade cellulosic ethanol from softwood at an unsubsidized operating cost of less than $1.50 per gallon.CREATING AN INDUSTRY WITH TECHNOLOGYCrucial to making the fuels economic is securing an ample, economic stream of feedstocks that can be cheaply turned into fuel, industry executives.Renewable Energy Group, whose shares debuted in January, produces biodiesel from animal, plant oil and recycled restaurant oils, says feedstocks have typically been between 85 percent to 90 percent of the cost of producing the fuel.The company has about 210 million gallons of capacity and has more than 100 suppliers for its feedstock.\"We are really trying to use these things that have a great carbon footprint and are messy to deal with,\" CEO Daniel Oh said. \"What we've essentially done is create real optionality across the feedstocks.\"Even with the growth expected over the next few years, many industry executives are wary of promising an energy revolution that could lead to unrealistic expectations.\"What we're doing is we're creating an industry with technology,\" said Kevin Weiss, CEO of Byogy Renewables, which makes jet fuel and gasoline from ethanol. \"It's pioneering for the next 20 to 30 years. It's not pioneering for tomorrow.\" (Reporting By Matt Daily in New York; Editing by Patricia Kranz and Andre Grenon)"}, {"title": "Sen. James Inhofe Seeks to Destroy Landmark EPA Ruling", "text": "For parents and health administrators who thought that 2011 had ended in a victory for clean air, 2012 is yielding a new surprise from an elected representative who is determined to put a stranglehold on the Environmental Protection Agency.It took more than two decades to nail down a ruling that would limit emissions of the neurotoxin mercury and other airborne chemicals that emanate from coal-fired power plants. Yet Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) has stepped up to the plate -- once again -- in an effort to rescind the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) announced on Dec. 21, 2011.How does Inhofe plan to do it? He introduced a resolution under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). If a majority votes with him, the health benefits of MATS would not just be obliterated, any potential for the EPA to create new standards with the same goals would effectively be cut off. Americans would lose the benefits of a reduction of the mercury and acid gas pollution that emanates from the power plants burning oil and coal.The EPA has put out stats stating that beginning in 2016, the MATS regulations will annually prevent:\u2022 130,000 asthma attacks \u2022 Approximately 5,000 heart attacks \u2022 Up to 11,000 premature deaths \u2022 5,700 emergency room and hospital visits \u2022 540,000 lost days of school and workInhofe and his supporters continue to cling to the \"jobs vs. clear air\" argument. However, the EPA has repeatedly refuted this claim, pointing to the almost 10,000 temporary construction jobs that would be created, in addition to 8,000 permanent utility jobs. An analysis from the Economic Policy Institute has formulated that \"by balancing benefits to health against costs of compliance -- the toxics rule is a clear win for Americans.\"Currently, one in 10 American women of child-bearing age has enough mercury in her blood stream to create risks to an unborn child. This is one of the reasons that more than 15 organizations signed on to a March 19, 2012 letter to senators asserting that Inhofe's resolution \"elevates the demands of polluters above the health and well being or our children.\" It urged a public refutation of \"any efforts to block, weaken or delay these vital public health protections.\" At the top of the list of signers was the American Academy of Pediatrics.Inhofe has established a unique niche in the environmental space by being the sole senator to oppose the Everglades restoration, and for his quote calling the EPA a \"Gestapo bureaucracy.\" In an editorial, the New York Times described him as \"one of the most persistent critics of the clean air laws.\"I reached out to Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, for his thoughts on Inhofe's move to bring down the EPA's landmark legislation. He responded by email with the following comment:\"After decades of delay, last December, the Environmental Protection Agency finally acted to require dirty coal and oil-fired power plants to clean up their mercury and deadly air toxic emissions. By targeting our nation's largest sources of mercury, this regulation requires polluters to reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent -- which will reduce the mercury that contaminates our streams and fish and end up in our children. This long overdue public health measure will help ensure our nation's utilities are doing their very best to keep our air clean -- allowing many people in this country to live better, healthier and, in some cases, longer lives. At the same time, the EPA has provided a reasonable and achievable schedule for our dirtiest power plants to reduce these harmful emissions. The agency has even allowed extra time if needed for the industry and states to address any possible local reliability concerns. Most communities will see great benefits from these rules -- in fact nationally we will see up to $90 billion in public health benefits. Modernizing our coal fleet is also expected to be a net job creator not a job killer. As someone who has tried for years to work across the aisle to find a way to clean up our nation's power plants, I was encouraged to see the EPA finally act to address these harmful emissions. I will be strongly opposing any efforts to prevent the EPA from moving forward with efforts to reduce these deadly emissions.\"It's now up to the voters to let their senators know that want to breathe unpolluted air.This article was written for Moms Clean Air Force.TELL YOUR SENATORS TO OPPOSE JIM INHOFE'S RADICAL CAMPAIGN"}, {"title": "Container Gardening Tips: How To Tend A No-Yard Garden", "text": "From Earth911's Mary Mazzoni:  Taking part in the grow-your-own-food movement is not only a satisfying way to commune with Mother Nature but can also save you money and reduce your carbon footprint.

It\u2019s a remote grasslands area that was the subject of an intense fight to protect the area from oil and gas industry development during the George W. Bush Administration.But now hard rock mining has come knocking on the Otero Mesa, driven by the burgeoning high-tech global demand for rare earth minerals widely used in electronics and new technologies. One company, Geovic Mining, is expected to start surveying operations this summer along the tallest peak in the area, Wind Mountain.Initial government surveys suggest the concentration of rare earth minerals is low compared to other areas being mined. According to the data available now, NRDC geologist Briana Mordick says it would take 10,000 grams of rock to get just 2-7 grams of rare earth elements Numbers like that, locals say, could threaten the entire mountain with destruction and create a massive waste disposal problem.But it\u2019s not just the destruction of this desert landscape, sensitive animal habitat and groundwater supplies that worries locals. Native American petroglyphs also were carved into the rock of Wind Mountain by tribes that roamed the land long before settlers pushed into these remote desert areas.

Not to mention a possible boost to their immune systems.His sons have their favorites. \"Carrots are up there and consumed after a brush with the shirt sleeve. But spinach in winter seems to be the prize,\" said Algiere, the farm manager at Stone Barns Center For Food and Agriculture. \"With most greens, they prefer to graze -- no hands -- rather than pick.\"Perhaps most importantly, Algiere knows that toxic fertilizers and pesticides will not have touched the carrots or spinach, and therefore can't pose any risks to his sons' health.\"Thanks to our improved understanding of the dynamics of soil, the luster of chemical agriculture has worn off,\" Algiere said. He once worked farmland the conventional way, but said he has since learned that nature really does know best when it comes to warding off unwanted weeds and insects, and feeding a plant what it needs to thrive.Nature's secret: healthy soil, composed of billions of tiny creatures that essentially become a plant's immune and digestive systems.But despite the way Algiere manages Stone Barns, many people are acting as soil spoilers, according to a new documentary called \"Symphony of the Soil.\" Our chemical dependencies are stripping soil of its life-giving duties and turning it into lifeless dirt, the film says. We've destroyed half the world's topsoil in the last 50 years, and a quarter of what's left is degraded. Experts in the film suggest that this loss is contributing to a range of today's ills: flooding, droughts, toxic algae blooms, contaminated drinking water, cancer, developmental problems, antibiotic-resistant infections, obesity and more.\"The connection between healthy soil and healthy people is so obvious,\" said Deborah Koons Garcia, director and producer of the film, which screened last weekend at Stone Barns.So, when and how did we lose sight of such a vital relationship? And can we find it again?DEGRADED INTO DIRTFred Kirschenmann, a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, pointed to his grandfather's generation: The first synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides emerged from the chemistry of weapons during the world wars, he said.\"[The chemicals] came as a saving grace,\" Kirschenmann, also board president at Stone Barns, says in the documentary. Greedy farming methods had already begun to increasingly outpace the land's natural production of nitrogen fertilizer, a delicate collaboration between plant, bacteria and other soil microorganisms.Applying chemical fertilizer, Kirschenmann's grandfather and other farmers could enjoy record returns from their land -- at least for the short term. But it wasn't long before the new tactics triggered a downward spiral for their soil, their crops and the overall health of the nation, the film says.Research suggests that the addition of synthetic fertilizer lowers a plant's natural defenses against pests. That increased vulnerability attracts more pests and can prompt a farmer to apply increasing amounts of insecticides and herbicides, which often kill beneficial insects and animals along with the intended targets. Over time, such use can lead to pesticide resistance and the need to apply even larger quantities or altogether different chemical concoctions.Meanwhile, synthetic fertilizers are also subject to the law of diminishing returns. More and more may be needed to help plants grow over time, which is especially true if only one type of plant is grown in a field. Without a diverse mix or rotation, the soil doesn't get a well-balanced, nourishing diet; Kirschenmann likened it to a person only eating French fries every day. What's more, these so-called monocultures are highly prone to pest outbreaks.And the cycle continues.\"There's always something else. This is great for pesticide companies,\" Garcia said. \"If you have healthy, alive soil, you don't need chemicals. Healthy soil exudes protection from bad guys.\"CHEMICAL CONCERNSMore than 10,000 chemicals are currently registered for agricultural use in the U.S., Paul Hepperly, who was research director of the nonprofit Rodale Institute during filming, says in the documentary. And with the ongoing development of new pesticides and new genetically modified crops designed to withstand them -- one of the latest being 2,4-D-resistant corn -- it doesn't seem like farmers will stop applying the annual 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides.When a chemical product is used, it is rarely confined to a farmer's fields.Research suggests that less than half of the synthetic fertilizer is actually absorbed by crops. The excess may be released into the air as a potent greenhouse gas, or it may leak into the soil and water systems, potentially contaminating drinking water and contributing to toxic algae blooms. Pesticides find a similar fate.In most cases, the health effects of these chemicals or mixtures of chemicals remain unknown. But science is slowly starting to catch up,  as The Huffington Post has reported, and prenatal or early childhood exposures appear capable of causing everything from birth defects to cancer to infertility. New research suggests that even tiny amounts of a toxic chemical can prove harmful to a developing child.A mixture of fertilizer and pesticide chemicals may be particularly dangerous -- and are often found together in waterways. As Warren Porter of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, explains in \"Symphony of the Soil,\" nitrates from fertilizer can worsen the situation by shutting off the body's defenses to toxic chemicals.\"It's like tying your hands behind back,\" he said.Even chemical-free operations can pose water woes. Poor soil can mean an increase in the frequency and intensity of both droughts and floods, even without changes in rainfall. (Of course, more extreme weather is predicted with climate change.)\"My prerogative is to protect the water system,\" said Stone Barns' Algiere, calling water the biggest public health concern for agriculture outside of production.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, soil with a healthy amount of living matter, say 5 percent, can absorb about six times more water than soil containing only 1 percent of organic material. The living content of the soil at Stone Barns tends to fall between 5 and 6 percent.If there is more absorption, then less soil -- as well as pesticides and fertilizers -- will run off the surface into waterways, and more freshwater will be able to restore aquifers. Further, if the soil soaks up a greater amount of water, it won't need as much additional water later to quench its thirst.About 70 percent of the planet's fresh water is currently used for agriculture irrigation. And that resource is depleting at a rapid and unsustainable rate. The water level of the Ogallala aquifer in the Midwest, for example, has dropped by more than half in 50 years.\"We need to adjust agriculture to suit nature, not the other way around,\" Kirschenmann said in an interview with The Huffington Post.'BETTER LIVING THROUGH BIOLOGY'Past Stone Barns' row of greenhouses, and a few hundred feet down a wooded trail, lies a pair of pigs caked in dark mud under the shade of trees.\"These animals have a reason to be in the woods,\" Algiere said. \"That is where they're from.\"Letting the pigs roll around in their natural surroundings is benefiting the farm as well. \"The pigs are digging up invasive species, opening up ground. These are things we never could do with a tractor,\" Algiere added.For millennia, animals were a farm staple, pooping out fertilizer and feeding the soil. \"When you take animals off the farm, you tend to get too much manure in one place,\" film director Garcia said, \"so you end up with two problems: excess manure and a lack of fertility.\"At the same time, having too many animals in one place can cause an array of other problems. Factory farms can become a breeding ground for infectious disease and antibiotic resistance.\"Whatever they're giving the animal is probably killing anything that would have killed that infestation,\" said Algiere, who uses no antibiotics and often lets his chickens freely roam sections of his fields. \"It's all part of the same story.\"Hepperly, of the Rodale Institute, suggests that story needs to be changed, perhaps by revising the 1960s-era notion that \"chemistry was better than life forces\" to one that \"lets life live.\"\"We call this better living through biology,\" he says."}, {"title": "Can a Chimp Outwit a Scientist?", "text": "Don't get me wrong -- I am a firm believer in science. I fully subscribe to evolutionary theory, and I think climate-change deniers are a menace to mankind. But let's face it -- science is not infallible. And nothing demonstrates the fallibility of science more than its stubborn, persistent refusal to acknowledge the intelligence of animals.Science has had to be dragged feet-first, kicking and screaming, into any recognition of animal awareness or capacity to experience pain. In this, science has been aided and abetted by philosophers, whose academic qualifications are no guarantee against blind adherence to dogma.This particular scientific prejudice has a long and illustrious history, going all the way back to Descartes, who flatly declared that animals were automatons, incapable of any awareness or sensitivity. But its most recent manifestation involves a chimpanzee named Santino, who lives in a zoo in Sweden.Santino evidently resents being the object of attention of the many human onlookers who visit his enclosure each day. He expresses his displeasure by hurling rocks at those who come to stare at him. Can there be any doubt about the meaning of this action?What made the case of Santino notable was when he gathered and arranged his rocks in neat piles each morning in anticipation of the arrival of the daily tourists. The anthropologists who discovered this reported it as evidence of Santino's ability to plan ahead. Their conclusion, however, was roundly disparaged by other scientists.Who is to say this was genuine evidence of planning? the skeptics asked. Maybe Santino just happened to be gathering and arranging the rocks out of habit.But then Santino went another step. He noticed that once he started hurling rocks, the visitors quickly retreated beyond his throwing range. So he started concealing the rocks behind logs or under piles of hay that he had arranged. This gave him a big advantage in casually approaching the onlookers and suddenly surprising them with a rock ready to throw.But even this did not convince the scientific skeptics. Oh, they said, we need to see an experiment, with piles of hay in more remote places, to see if Santino would hide rocks there as well.Santino has made the meaning of his actions so conspicuous that only fools could doubt it. But sometimes even scientists line up on the side of fools.In his book Kinds of Minds: Toward an Understanding of Consciousness, the eminent academic philosopher Daniel Dennett goes to considerable lengths to defend this attitude. He even invokes the legal standard \"innocent until proven guilty\" -- meaning it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that animals have any kind of intelligence, awareness, or sensitivity before it can be accepted by science.According to Dennett, this represents the \"null hypothesis,\" standard procedure in the scientific method. He doesn't seem to realize that the null hypothesis is merely an experimental convenience, and could just as easily be construed the other way around: Our null hypothesis could be that animals are sensitive, aware, and intelligent -- unless and until proven otherwise.Dennett hides his prejudice behind the seemingly innocuous \"innocent until proven guilty\" standard -- without realizing he has actually declared animals guilty until proven innocent. We cannot believe they have minds, he says, until someone can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they do.Scientists are deeply mistrustful of anything that might be interpreted as anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute human qualities to rocks, trees, animals, and other non-human entities. But what about the equal danger of anthropocentrism, the insistence that certain abilities are unique to humans? For some reason that intellectual prejudice is not so worrisome within the scientific community.Science does exceedingly well at understanding issues remote from the scientist -- stars and galaxies, atoms and electrons. But the capacities of animals happen to throw an oblique light on the scientist himself, and so introduce an element of self-interest and distortion.Fortunately, the scientific method is designed to correct for that kind of imbalance, given sufficient time and opportunity. Let's hope the behavior of Santino helps hasten the arrival of that day."}, {"title": "5 More Ways Recycling Can Benefit Your Community", "text": "We all know recycling is good for the environment, but many don\u2019t realize the ways recycling can positively impact their own community.

City Council members Jessica Lappin and Dan Garodnick were on hand to lend their support. Jed Garfield, president of Residents for Sane Trash Solutions, along with the group's vice president, David Mack, delivered comments at the podium. Dr. Jennifer Ratner, an active neighborhood resident who practices Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Pediatrics, introduced speakers. A mock check was presented to the city in the amount of $245 million, earmarked to go back to services for the community, such as firefighters, police, and parks.Why the rally? Because this year the city has plans to demolish the East 91st Street Garbage Station, which has been closed for years, in order to build a 10-story Garbage Marine Transfer Station (MTS) on the same site.It's almost impossible to transverse these communities without seeing posters against the proposed MTS on store windows, or being handed a leaflet while waiting for a Crosstown bus.\"New York City is spending $400 million to pollute the neighborhood, severely impair the quality of life and threaten kids,\" said Mack. \"The community is very motivated to fight this disastrous project.\"There are plenty of facts being disseminated, from stats and safety concerns to escalating costs. If the deal goes through, the Marine Transfer Station would be the only one in the five boroughs to be located in a residential neighborhood.The top concern is that the proposed facility entrance ramp would pass through Asphalt Green, the health and sports center that has more than one million visitors per year. One-fifth of that number is comprised of children.Yorkville and East Harlem have the worst air quality in all of New York City, with the highest asthma rate for residents of East Harlem. The station would be located approximately 250 feet from the Stanley Issacs and Holmes public housing residential complexes -- where over 2,000 people live. Residents for Sane Trash Solutions says that the project would increase the area's air pollution by at least 16 percent.I contacted Charlie Platt, outside counsel for Residents for Sane Trash Solutions, with a list of questions. He responded by e-mail:What are the goals of the May 15 demonstration?To demonstrate that the proposed MTS is an industrial plant that will be right in the middle of a densely populated residential neighborhood where middle and lower class New Yorkers live. Industrial plants don't belong in any residential neighborhood for any reason.What is the exact nature of what will be taking place at the MTS facility being proposed?The city proposes to build a huge industrial plant that is 10-stories high and two acres wide in the East River at 91st Street. The plant would be capable of processing more than 5,000 tons of garbage a day, 24 hours a day, six days a week, and will be accessed by up to 500 garbage trucks a day. The city will build a huge ramp for these trucks right through the middle of Asphalt Green, which is an athletic facility that serves thousands of city kids every day.Why has the price tag on the MTS skyrocketed from $45 million to $250 million?Only the city knows why it dramatically underestimated the cost of this project to jam it through the City Council. We think the real cost is more than $400 million, which is absurdly expensive at a time the city is laying off firefighters and cutting children's programs. The cost will be even higher because all the garbage from this facility will have to go to very expensive landfills.Where will the solid waste from the facility be dumped?In landfills that have never been identified, but that will be very expensive and environmentally insensitive.Why is the city generating bids on construction if the Army Corps of Engineers have not yet granted a permit?The city's plan has always been to jam this project through before the public realizes this is not a sane trash solution.Who is spearheading this placement?The mayor's office and Christine Quinn on the City Council.Organizers announced that another rally is planned for Saturday, May 19, hosted by Rep. Carolyn Maloney. It will take place at Asphalt Green.

Launched by the United States Senate, the annual event takes place the third Friday in May and is celebrated by thousands of people throughout the country at parks, wildlife refuges, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, libraries, schools and community centers.Endangered Species Day provides an opportunity for people of all ages to learn about the efforts that are currently underway to preserve our world's wildlife populations and discover how they can help support these initiatives. It is also the perfect forum to educate the general public on topics such as wildlife, plant and natural resource conservation and welfare, and the significance of creating a legacy for future generations that we can all be proud of.Perhaps most importantly, today's celebration offers a platform to discuss the Endangered Species Act, or the \"ESA,\" a critical piece of legislation designed to protect imperiled wildlife and plants from extinction. The ESA has proven vital for the continued conservation of hundreds of species since its creation in 1973 -- some of its most well-known beneficiaries include the American bald eagle, the African elephant, the grizzly bear, the tiger and the Northern Atlantic Right whale.Unfortunately, implementing the Endangered Species Act is not without challenges. There is currently a laundry list of animals and plants seeking protection, and it has become increasingly evident that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the federal agencies charged with administering the ESA -- cannot process the petitions fast enough.This reality is especially disconcerting for animals such as African lions -- a species for which IFAW submitted a technical and scientific petition to list as Endangered under the ESA in March 2011. The review process for listing a species under the ESA now takes anywhere from two to five years to complete, and the sad truth is that irreversible damage can be done to these wildlife populations during that time.For example, even if the U.S. government finds that African lions deserve the protections from trade that accompany a listing, literally hundreds -- if not thousands -- of individual lions will have been killed and imported into the country by American trophy hunters while the petition review process was underway. For a species that is believed to have only 35,000 individuals left in the wild, this could significantly harm some lion populations' chances of recovery. So while the ESA is still considered one of the strongest and most important animal conservation laws in the world, there is a need to improve the way it is being implemented in order to provide timely emergency relief for species struggling to survive.Endangered Species Day is guaranteed to be an eye-opening experience for anyone who participates. Today, thousands of Americans have the chance to learn about species in danger of extinction and the tools for -- and challenges to -- facilitating recovery.With humanity already leaving an omnipresent footprint on the world, the Earth's animals and the ecosystems in which they live are now dependent on us for survival. It is our responsibility to ensure they are on our planet for generations to come. Establishing our legacy for tomorrow begins today.Jeff Flocken is the DC office director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).

We are a diversified family operation spanning over 5,400 acres located on the northern Great Plains near Bismarck, North Dakota. For over 15 years, we have said NO to unsustainable ranching and farming practices by implementing non-conventional approaches that allow us to farm in nature's image, and farm more successfully than we ever have. We use a very diverse mix of crops, called polycultures, along with animal impact to improve soil health, which directly improves the quality of the food we eat.Let's start by taking a look at the root of the problem. Production agriculture today is one of man imposing his will on nature. Corn, soybeans, wheat and a myriad of other crops are all grown as monocultures lacking agronomic diversity with the heavy use of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides. In most cases the soil is \"prepared\" for planting by mechanically altering it, also known as tillage. Cattle, hogs and poultry are raised in unnatural environments and consume feed that often contains non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics. All of these practices not only deplete the health of and the life in the soil but they also make the soil unsustainable. This has led to a sharp decrease in the nutrient density of the food we consume.Prior to Shelly and I purchasing the ranch in 1991, the native rangeland on our ranch was in poor health. It had minimal plant diversity due to many years of season long grazing, which allows the livestock the opportunity to bite the plants they prefer as soon as they regrow, thus weakening the plant and eventually killing it. For decades, the cropland had been conventionally farmed with tillage and the use of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides. Tillage had lowered organic matter levels to less than 2 percent which decreases the water holding capacity of the soil making it more susceptible to drought. These common and unsustainable farming practices not only limit crop diversity but have a detrimental effect on soil quality. And it is soil quality that sustains life. We found we had to increase the use of fertilizers, herbicides and fungicides just to maintain production on the cropland.In 1993 we purchased a no-till drill and converted 100 percent of our cropland to no-till. Although this helped to conserve moisture and fuel, our inputs continued to rise. We came to the conclusion that what we were really seeing was symptoms of a greater problem and that problem was poor soil health. Our soils had become nothing more than a median to hold the plants upright, and not only lacked structure and organic matter, it lacked LIFE!So, we had to ask ourselves, how do we improve soil health? We found the answer in native rangeland. Healthy native range is not only sustainable, it is regenerative. That is what we needed to do to our soils; regenerate them. Well managed native range has a tremendous amount of diversity, warm and cool season, broadleaves and grasses. Healthy native range is also developed with and is maintained by grazing species. This meant we needed to integrate our cropping and livestock enterprises and manage synergistically so that no part of our ranch works in isolation. Strategic animal impact became an important tool in developing healthy soil.We started by cross fencing our pastures so we could rotate our cattle and give the rangeland time to recover. Next, we began to diversify the cropping enterprise. We did this by adding peas and alfalfa to the crop rotation. In 1995 we started growing corn. The night before we were to begin harvesting our spring wheat, a hailstorm came and we lost 100 percent of our crop. With no crop insurance the losses were devastating. In 1996 we diversified even more by adding winter triticale and hairy vetch, along with barley and red clover. We started growing these crops in combination with each other so the legume would fix the nitrogen needed by the grass and the grass would help supply the legume with phosphorus thus allowing us to reduce our fertilizer needs. This strategy was working. However, another hailstorm destroyed our crops once again. Financially we were struggling so we had to look at further ways to reduce input costs. After the hailstorm, we seeded a cover crop of sudan grass and millet as forage to feed our cattle. This kept us from purchasing extra feed and it got the cattle out of the corrals and onto the cropland thus benefiting both.Extreme weather hit yet again and a 1997 drought prevented us from harvesting any of our crops. Yet, something was happening through the regenerative nurturing of the soil. Residue now protected the soil surface, and visible improvements of soil structure and organic matter levels were increasing, thus allowing our soils to hold more water. Even in a drought our land produced enough feed for our livestock. However, the following year was not much better as we lost 80 percent of our crop to hail. We had nothing to lose and everything to gain at that point. Simply enough, the answer was the soil beneath us. Although those four years were extremely difficult financially, Shelly and I say they were the best thing that could have happened to us because they proved to us that we had to focus on regenerating the resource -- the richness of the earth.Since those four years of hardship we have continued to grow our strategies to regenerate and diversify our landscapes, by practicing Holistic Management and focusing on solving problems, not treating symptoms. Cover crops have become an integral tool in this regeneration. Cover crops are plants that are grown for the purpose of feeding soil life. There are more organisms in a teaspoon full of healthy soil than there are people on earth. These organisms live off of secretions from plant roots known as root exudates. In turn, these organisms make nutrients available to the plant. They cannot live without each other. We now plant cover crops throughout the growing season. Some are planted before a cash crop, some after, and others are grown in companion with a cash crop. All of the cover crops are grown as poly cultures, never as a monoculture. You do not find monocultures in nature with the exception of where man put them. Growing species together is the way they have naturally evolved.In 2011 we grew over 25 different crops. This plant diversity improves soil health in a number of ways. The first is by sequestering carbon. There is no better way to sequester carbon than a healthy, diverse ecosystem. Secondly, root exudates are the building blocks for soil particles and structure. Third, root exudates feed soil biology and it is this biology that provides all living things (plants, animals, and people) the nutrients they need. Finally, species diversity increases organic matter which allows more water holding capacity in the soil and feeds macro-organisms.We have continued to integrate the livestock and cropping enterprises. We now graze livestock on the cover crops at various times of the year. For example, some of our spring seeded cover crops are grazed with high stock densities for a short period of time. This is vastly beneficial to soil health because the act of grazing stimulates the plants to release root exudates thus feeding soil biology. We have worked with microbiologist Dr. Jill Clapperton to document large increases in soil biology following this scenario. The grazing animals also return nutrients to the soil, increasing the lands fertility. We also graze summer and fall seeded cover crops during the late fall and winter. This is not only beneficial to the soil but it also works to keep livestock healthy and out of confinement.The prairies of the northern plains were developed by large herds of bison and other ruminants, grazing an area for a brief time and then moving on. This allowed the rangeland to fully recover before the animals returned. Grazing our rangeland is an integral component to the health of our ecosystem. We are mimicking nature on our grazing lands, only we use cattle and poultry. We allow our cattle to mob graze a pasture for a brief time, usually less than two days, and then we move them to another pasture. This is usually the only time that pasture will be grazed the entire year. This allows all of the plants time to fully recover. It has also greatly enriched species diversity (not to mention the huge amount of carbon that is being sequestered during this timeframe). It is important to note that if we did not graze our rangeland the health of this ecosystem would actually deteriorate as grazing ruminants are an integral component of it.The ecosystem transformation has brought about an exponential increase in the wildlife that now abounds in these rangelands. Large populations of white-tailed deer, coyotes, fox, weasels, mink, raccoons, sharptail grouse, hungarian partridge, many species of raptors, duck geese and too many songbirds to count. Even the population of insects has substantially increased as well. The recovered pastures provide cover and protection. The growth following grazing provides a high quality food source. Native species have proliferated and they all play an important role in the ecosystem.So, what has been our results of focusing on regenerating our resources and managing for the whole? We have increased our organic matter levels from less than 2 percent to over 5 percent on some fields. This has been a tremendous benefit. It means that on one acre we now have over 100,000# of organic carbon in the top foot alone! That same foot of soil is now capable of holding over 108,000 gallons of water per acre! If all agricultural land could hold this abundance of water, just imagine the range of implications for the health of our water quality and supplies, from alleviating potential flooding impacts to keeping harmful fertilizers and pesticides out of our rivers, lakes and oceans.The living biology in our soil has increased to the point that we no longer use synthetic fertilizer. This soil biology provides the plants with the nutrients they need. We do not use any fungicides or pesticides. A healthy ecosystem thrives on its own. Skeptics say we cannot feed the world with this return to natural based farming and ranching on large scales. That is simply not true. Our average corn yield is over 20 percent higher than the county average and we've seen strong net profits consistently for many years.Too often people tend to categorize things as good or bad without understanding how they function for the health of the entire system. For instance, some people presume meat is unhealthy and that cattle destroy the environment. But if cattle are integrated into the productive work of the farm, raised on healthy soil and sustainably without antibiotics, we can achieve incredible environmental and food outcomes. Our cattle play an integral role in regenerating our resources by grazing. Our grass finished beef is nutrient dense and healthy with proteins, CLA, Omega 3's, Vitamin E, Iron and many other essential nutrients. Our pastured poultry and eggs are just as healthy. We believe that the grains we grow are also more nutrient dense because of our healthy soils. When these functions work in harmony with one another, it's a win-win.It is our family's passion to show others just how vital, practical and possible it is to regenerate our landscapes through innovative farming and ranching practices. We have an open door policy on our ranch. If anyone wants to visit our operation we are going to try and take the time to show it to them. We host thousands of visitors each year and I am proud to say that we have had visitors from all 50 states and 15 foreign countries tour our ranch.Winning a Growing Green Award from the Natural Resources Defense Council is instrumental in helping us elevate the importance of regenerating our landscapes to make our food systems stronger and more resilient. We need to holistically manage our resources and move towards a balance of biodiversity in our food producing systems. And we need to do it now. As Charles Kome once said, \"We need to understand that the quality of our lives depends on the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. All of those things depend on the quality of our SOIL!\""}, {"title": "Adopted Rescue Cat Takes Family Responsibility Seriously", "text": "Sometimes you rescue a cat, and sometimes that cat rescues you right back. Talk to a few of New York City's Anjellicle Cats Rescue (ACR) volunteers and you will hear amazing tales of cats that have entered the lives of their human adopters and changed them for the better.One such relationship started with a homeless cat named Nina. Nina was one of many cats that are rescued at the last minute from New York City's crowded Animal Care and Control who was in danger of being euthanized. Anjellicle Cats Rescue and a whole host of other non-profit, all-volunteer rescue groups in the New York City area operate under the umbrella of the Mayor's Alliance and frequently pull cats out of the shelter to give them a second chance to find a permanent home.Anjellicle Cats rescued Nina and worked to find her a new home. At one point, Nina was adopted, but due to her new owner's circumstances, was returned to ACR. She lived in the \"cat room\" located in the back of Spoiled Brats, a pet store in Hell's Kitchen. Many of ACR's cats are housed in foster homes until they are adopted, or live in one of three pet stores throughout the city.Soon enough, Nina was adopted again and this time, her new adopter, Natacha Diaz, contacted Anjellicle Cats after a few weeks to let them know that Nina had provided them with a heartwarming surprise. Nina had not only found a home, but a purpose. Both of Natacha's older children, Liani, 7, and Ethan, 5, have pervasive developmental disorder and are high-functioning on the autistic spectrum. Before Nina came to their home, the kids had been through many different types of ongoing therapies in order to help them cope with day-to-day changes and activities.\"While the therapies have helped them,\" Natacha said, \"I must say that Nina has brought them a sense of calm that my husband and I haven't seen before. She is always by their side when they are going through emotional changes and she brings them a sense of peace as they rub her head and back. Liani even wrote a book in school titled, All About Cats.\" Natacha explained that Ethan has had serious sensory integration issues, so they were very pleased when it became apparent that petting Nina was good for Ethan, and was really helping him.There's also 2 year-old Mali, who loves Nina just as much as her brother and sister, and two hamsters. \"There's a lot going on in the house and Nina has a very calming effect on all of us,\" Natacha said, and her husband Ramon agreed.Nina has so much love to give and this is what endeared her to ACR volunteers and her new  family.\"She always takes part in everything we do, from playing with Ethan and his cars, to being alongside Liani as she reads, to following Mali around the house and showering us all with her wonderful kitty kisses,\" said Natacha. \"She has provided us with so much warmth and comfort.We couldn't imagine our days without her. We appreciate what Nina does for our kids.\"For her part, Nina takes everything in stride, and simply watches over her family with curiosity and calm. She follows the children to their bedroom, goes after the toys they throw and retreats to her favorite chair to nap in the sun. It is the perfect example of the symbiotic relationship between a rescued shelter cat and a loving family.\"It really was destiny that Nina came to us,\" Natacha said.

A new journal article says, depending on the area, as many as 40 percent of mammals migrate too slowly and won't be able to keep pace with climate shifts expected in the next hundred years.Japan Faces Summer TestWhile Iran and the U.N. nuclear agency discussed Iran's nuclear program and suspicions Tehran may have tested nuclear arms technology, Japan decided to restart nuclear reactors in one town as others there contemplated how to handle things nuclear-free before the summer's heat sets in. At least one utility in the country is considering a rate hike to compensate for the impending hot weather, while the Japanese operator of the Fukushima plant posted a $10 billion loss stemming from the meltdown. The town is the first to restart a nuclear reactor since all the nation's nuclear reactors were shut off following the Fukushima disaster roughly one year ago. According to one newspaper poll, residents there are split on nuclear power.In the U.S., California also faces threats of summer power shortages due to complications with the San Onofre nuclear plant. And the nuclear reactor being built in Augusta, Ga., will not only be completed behind schedule, but come in at a much higher price -- approximately $900 million.Could cheap natural gas be choking aging nuclear plants? E&E Publishing reported the nuclear industry is questioning whether lower natural gas prices will put pressure on plants, just as cheap gas has done to coal.EPA Declares Gasland Town's Water SafeVermont made history this week by becoming the first state to ban hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" the hotly debated natural gas drilling technique that injects a mixture of water and chemicals underground at high pressures to release hard-to-reach oil and natural gas. The ban is not predicted have an immediate effect, however, because the state has no fracking projects under way and no evidence of natural gas reserves.The news comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested more money to probe the technique. It was just days after the EPA announced water in the town made famous by hydraulic fracturing and the movie Gasland was given a clean bill of health. Though water at one home did show elevated levels of methane, the well water was declared safe. The EPA released data for 59 of the 61 wells tested, claiming \"the set of sampling did not show levels of contaminants that would give the EPA reason to do further testing.\" The finding has residents of the northeastern Pennsylvania town disputing the claim. The lawsuits and tests revolving around the use of hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas have made it difficult for insurers to price risk.While drilling continues in Pennsylvania -- generating about $3.5 billion in 2011 -- the U.S. Department of Interior recently found roughly two-thirds of land leased by the oil industry goes unused. This equates to roughly 46 million acres both on- and offshore.Recent cyber attacks aimed at computer networks belonging to U.S. natural gas pipeline companies may have ties to China, the Christian Science Monitor reported. The U.S. and China have agreed to cooperate on cyber security despite China's implication in the pipeline attacks. As a whole, the energy sector is becoming more vulnerable to these types of attacks, which also struck Iran last month.Some, however, are looking to other methods for energy generation. One group of researchers in California is trying to harness viruses for energy needs. As Norway opened the world's largest carbon capture and storage test facility, La Ventosa Mexico -- the windy place -- inched its way toward earning a title for \"the largest growth of wind power projects anywhere in the world.\" The Atlantic Wind Connection project, a network of offshore wind farms off the East Coast that could power close to two million homes in the next 10 years, received permission to move forward. The \"first-of-its-kind project\" would be served by a 380-mile underwater power line running from Virginia to New Jersey.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

From the soaring skyscrapers of Sao Paulo to the manufacturing center of Manaus, this country is taking the 21st century and running with it. The nation hosts the soccer World Cup in 2014, the Olympics in 2016 and the Rio + 20 Earth summit in just a few weeks time. These events signify platinum membership on the world stage, proof that Brazil is arriving as one of the world's true superpowers.But not everything here is shiny and new. In the heart of the Amazon, a scandal is unfolding which threatens the reputation of both the Brazilian president and some of the biggest car companies in the world. In the Carajas region of Northern Brazil, hundreds of remote charcoal camps are hidden from view, some visible only by airplane. Vast rows of mud furnaces line up like ant hills, burning rainforest wood and poisoning those who stoke them with particulates, asthma and disease. Workers are lured to the camps with the promise of good wages and then told to pay off huge (and unjustified) debts as soon as they arrive, or are simply not paid at all. Brazil officially banned slavery a little over 125 years ago, but the evidence of forced unpaid labor here shows that the country has not yet eradicated this terrible legacy.Only a tiny fraction of this charcoal ends up in barbeques. In fact, the vast majority is used by industry, including Brazilian companies who shovel it into giant blast furnaces to convert raw iron ore into 'pig iron' -- a key ingredient in the steel-making process. This is then exported from Brazil in giant cargo ships like the one Greenpeace is blockading right now. 80% of Brazilian pig iron goes to the USA and is bought by cast-iron foundries and steel mills like the Severstal plant in Columbus, Mississippi. The resulting steel is used by some of the biggest players in the game -- companies like Ford, GM, BMW and Mercedes.Greenpeace Brazil spent the past two years investigating this problem and has produced a new report, Driving Destruction in the Amazon, which contains evidence designed to put a stop to this inhumane and antisocial trade once and for all. Our activists are hanging off the anchor chain of a cargo ship here in Sao Luis to make sure the issue is not swept under the carpet, which is what happened six years ago when the scandal was first brought to light. They've been occupying the narrow chain for over 80 hours, an impressive feat of endurance but nothing in comparison to the suffering borne by the rainforest communities at the center of this trade.It's not good enough for the U.S. car industry to claim that the problem is too far removed from them, that they have little control over their massive supply chain. Companies like Ford claim to have 'zero tolerance' for slave labor, but if Greenpeace can find this evidence then they can too. By insisting that their pig iron suppliers are free from deforestation and slavery -- and holding them to account -- they can change the game almost overnight. And President Dilma, too, can boost her environmental and judicial reputation by acting on this before the summit opens in a month's time. Anything less would be a step backwards for a country that is fast becoming a leading light on the world stage."}, {"title": "Water Enough for All?", "text": "All during spring and summer I love to watch the huge fish hawks called Ospreys building up their stick nests, then incubating their eggs, and then raising their chicks. How many chicks, how many Ospreys for that matter, depends on how much food.The same's true for people. But Ospreys can't make more fish for themselves. People, we're different. By fishing, we take food from Ospreys (and many other creatures). And by farming we make more food, something that the birds can't do.In the latter half of the 20th century, humanity's food production tripled, thanks to new high-yield grain varieties, artificial pesticides and fertilizer (40 to 60 percent of the nitrogen in the human body now originates in a factory), and -- pumped water.World grain production tripled in the second half of the 20th century. The Green Revolution was accomplished largely by doubling the amount of irrigated land. Hundreds of millions of wells now reach into the earth like straws in a thick drink on a hot day. But as with many things, we're taking more water than we're getting.Because much food production relies on pumping groundwater faster than it recharges, the world has blown a big food bubble. The Green Revolution turned India -- where millions once died in famines -- into a food exporter. But now in parts of India, water tables are dropping more than half an inch a day. Many wells are depleted, and irrigated farmland has shrunk.India recently stopped sending rice to Bangladesh, then India began importing rice from Australia. (But Australia's droughts dropped wheat exports 60 percent; its rice exports plunged 90 percent.) An Indian water official said ominously, \"When the balloon bursts, untold anarchy will be the lot of rural India.\"Many wells mine deep \"fossil\" water, vast reserves of locked-away liquid that, like oil, can be pumped dry. Where China grows half its wheat and a third of its corn, the water table drops ten feet each year. In the U.S. the water has dropped more than 100 feet under Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.In many countries, women walk an average of four to five miles just for household water. By 2025, as many as two-thirds of all people will live in places suffering a scarcity of clean water. Health experts expect lack of clean water to cause more cholera, dysentery, hepatitis and infant mortality.Who will have water? A ton of grain represents a thousand tons of water, and grain imports become proxy for rain. The poorest countries will of course lose the bidding for food.

It was stupid. Fortunately, I learned several lessons about a car's engine.First, when your car's engine light starts flashing without warning; clouds of steam rise from under the hood; the needle on the temperature gauge sticks in the red zone -- stop the car.Second, if you hear clunking and vibrations from the engine -- stop the car.In both instances, I decided to run the car anyway and ended up replacing a blown engine. Costing money and needlessly putting lives, including my own, at risk.Unbelievably, Southern California Edison is faced with a similar decision with its crippled San Onofre nuclear power plant on the coast in Orange County. The reactors have already released radioactive steam and are literally shaking themselves apart. Instead of keeping the reactors shut down, Southern Edison is rushing to restart the reactors and running them as hard as possible.San Onofre's twin reactors have been shut down since January, after leaks developed in some of the thousands of thin, tightly packed tubes that carry radioactive steam from the plant's generators -- crucial components that were meant to last for decades but failed after less than two years of operation. As the Associated Press reported, Edison gambled more than half a billion dollars -- costs it passed on to its customers -- on a new generator design in an attempt to increase the power produced by the reactors.Since then, Edison has failed to provide the detailed technical information required by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to decide if and when the reactors can be restarted. Instead, Edison is pushing for a restart as early as next month. The utility insists that San Onofre can be operated safely if some of the faulty tubes are plugged and the reactors are run at reduced power.A new report (PDF) commissioned by Friends of the Earth found that the design of the generators themselves is faulty -- a problem that could have been detected if Edison had allowed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to properly review its plans before the new generators were installed. The report by Arnie Gundersen, a nuclear engineer of 40 years' experience, found that plugging tubes and restarting the reactors at reduced power won't solve the problem -- and could make it worse, risking a catastrophe that would endanger the 8-million-plus people who live within 50 miles of the reactors and millions more beyond. Friends of the Earth is working with communities and activists throughout southern California to try to avoid such a disaster and to demand no restart of the San Onofre reactors.City councillors in southern California are drawing the same conclusions about the risks of operating San Onofre, stating that common sense tells you that a dangerous reactor at 100 percent power remains dangerous at 50-80 percent power. For those reasons and more the City of Irvine Council -- representing a population of more than 200,000 and located less than 22 miles from the nuclear reactors -- has called on the NRC to not approve an early restart of the reactors unless it can guarantee no repeat of the problems in the generators.We've also released a new ad (below) sounding the alarm about Edison's risky scheme, urging concerned Californians to contact U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Sen. Boxer, chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has already stepped up, asking the NRC and Edison by May 21 to produce documentation about what Edison knew about the new generators' design and whether the agency adequately reviewed them.Edison has raised the spectre of blackouts this summer if San Onofre, representing half of the nuclear power capacity in the state, remains shut down. This is an irresponsible threat. The agency that manages the state's power grid says blackouts can be avoided through energy conservation. San Onofre must remain closed so that California can move toward a clean and safe energy future."}, {"title": "Is There a Clean Energy Standard in Our Future?", "text": "Crossposted with The Green Grok.Americans want it, but how much will it cost?Just because Congress is unlikely to pass a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade bill anytime soon does not mean the United States can't work on lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. It turns out there's more than one way for America to skin that carbon cat.It starts by splitting the problem into two parts. Turns out about 60 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from two sources: transportation (27 percent) and electricity generation (34 percent). If the federal government can figure out how to lower emissions from those two sources through regulations and standards, we'll have gone a long way to licking the problem.On the motor vehicle side we've actually made significant progress. If the new corporate average fleet economy standards (aka CAFE) proposed by the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency stand, average fuel efficiency of new cars will increase from about 26 miles per gallon today to 50 miles per gallon by 2025. (See EPA's numbers on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel economy trends, and my post on fuel economy trends for some context.) That will translate into a halving of the transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetime of the vehicles sold by 2025 relative to 2010.Things have proved to be a good deal more difficult on the electricity side. EPA has recently used its authority under the Clean Air Act (as directed to by the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v EPA) to propose carbon emission standards on new electric power plants. But while quite controversial, they do little more than enforce business as usual and will not bring about a significant decrease in emissions from the electrical sector.Another approach to reducing emissions from electricity generation is through a clean energy standard, which specifies a minimum percentage from so-called \"clean energy\" sources. Of course, the devil is often in the details and in the case of a clean energy standard one of the devils is what is defined as a clean energy source. There is what I call the \"strong\" clean energy definition, meaning only renewable (essentially carbon-free) sources; there's the \"moderate\" definition, which includes renewable plus nuclear energy; and finally there's the \"weak\" clean energy definition, which includes all of the above plus cleaner fossil fuel sources such as natural gas or coal with carbon capture and storage.To date, almost 37 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico have gotten on board with either a renewable energy standard or goal. (See this excellent map [pdf] for an idea of who is doing what.) Some are more ambitious than others. They range from requiring anywhere from 10 to 40 percent renewable power as early as 2015 or as late as 2035.The president has gotten into the act too and has stated a goal of \"80 percent clean energy by 2035\" as part of his \"Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future\" [pdf], which would \"create a domestic market for clean energy, drive innovation, and create new energy jobs and industries.\" Obama's plan adopts the weak definition for clean energy and includes renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower; nuclear power; natural gas; and coal with carbon capture utilization and sequestration. Still, it's a pretty ambitious goal.A president can have great aspirations but it's going to be pretty difficult to get there without Congressional action. And that's where Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) comes in. He has proposed the \"Clean Energy Standard Act\" (S2146) that lays out a road map to reach Obama's goal.The legislation would use a market-based approach that is inclusive of the energy technologies in Obama's blueprint. Beginning in 2015, Bingaman's proposed standard would require that the largest eight percent of utilities sell 24 percent of their electricity from clean energy sources. Each year that percentage would grow by three percent rising to meet the goal of 80 percent in 2035. In 2025, the proposed standard would cover just 13 percent of utilities. Some smaller utilities would be exempt.*While many think this is a good start, some critics complain that the bill fails to carve out a specific role for energy efficiency.Good start or no, you might be wondering about the economics of the bill; specifically, will it raise your utility bill so much that you'll have to move to the poorhouse? To answer that, Sen. Bingaman asked the U.S. Energy Information Administration to crunch some numbers. Those findings were released in early May.EIA's findings suggest that you probably won't need to relocate to pauper-ville but it will cost you some. According to EIA, the bill would:This is similar to but a bit higher than a 2011 independent analysis that found a clean energy standard would increase national average electricity rates by less than five percent through 2030, reaching 11 percent in 2035.Polls show that most Americans want renewable energy, pretty much regardless of political affiliation. But how much of that support evaporates when a price tag is associated with it? A paper by Joseph Aldy of Harvard University and colleagues appearing in this week's Nature Climate Change takes a stab at answering that question. Their analysis included an April/May 2011 survey of about 1,000 people gauging their support for \"80 percent clean energy by 2035\" as well as modeling of how that support would translate into elected officials' willingness to pass a clean energy standard bill.The Aldy et al. study confirms that \"a majority of U.S. citizens support clean energy and climate-change policies.\" However, that support is cost-sensitive and declines as costs increase. They found that the average American is willing to pay about 13 percent more or an average of about $162 (95 percent confidence range is $128- $260) per year in higher electricity bills to reach the 80 percent goal. That's not quite as large as the 18 percent increase in costs for the bill estimated by the EIA.In contrast to the general support for a clean energy standard in the United States, the authors found that 24-30 percent of the public would oppose clean energy standards even if there were no extra cost. Perhaps it's not that surprising, but this suggests that there is a pretty sizable contingent of Americans who are ideologically opposed to clean energy and/or to government mandates for clean energy standards regardless of the economics.Perhaps more disheartening for supporters of a standard, Aldy et al. found a \"stark contrast\" between the average American's preference for clean energy and the preferences of the voting blocks that determined the membership of the current Congress. Assuming each member of Congress would vote on the clean energy standard in a manner that is consistent with her or his constituency, the Senate would only be likely to pass such a bill if the average household increase in electricity bills were no more than $59 per year (an almost five percent hike). To pass the House, the average household electric bill couldn't increase by more than $48 per year (an almost four percent hike).Americans are behind Obama, in the sense that they support the president's concept of a national clean energy standard. But they're also behind, in the sense that the voting public is unwilling to go as far as the president wants to go because of costs. To get to where he wants America to go, the president's going to have to convince a good deal of those lagging Americans to catch up. Of course, depending on what happens in November, it could turn out that that convincing task will fall to his Republican opponent. Wouldn't that be interesting?Per the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee website, the proposed clean energy standard would work like this: \"All generators of clean energy would be given credits based upon their carbon emissions. Greater numbers of credits would be awarded to generators with lower emissions per unit of electricity. This flexible framework naturally allows a wide variety of sources (solar, wind, nuclear, natural gas, coal with carbon capture and storage, etc.) to be used to meet the standard; allows market forces to determine what the optimal mix of technologies and fuels should be; and makes it easy for new technologies to be incorporated.\""}, {"title": "National Park Unit Should Remain a Sanctuary for Newly Recovered Species", "text": "By the end of the 1920s, the gray wolf had been eradicated from the greater Yellowstone ecosystem of northwestern Wyoming and southwestern Montana. This species had called this beautiful, mountainous region home for thousands of years, but was pushed out by human development and largely unfounded fears. And the environment suffered for it. Without a top predator, the elk and other grazing species here became lazy, damaging the health of habitats and other species by staying too long in one location and compromising their own genetic make-up.After years of hard work and compromise dating back to the 1960s, actions were finally taken to restore the greater Yellowstone ecosystem's top predator. In 1995 the National Park Service (NPS) released gray wolves back into the wild inside Yellowstone National Park and since then the species has thrived, becoming a favorite for tourists visiting our nation's first national park. But this successful recovery may soon be in jeopardy if appropriate protections are not taken in anticipation of the gray wolf coming off the endangered species list in Wyoming, which is expected to happen just weeks from today.Wyoming already plans, as soon as the wolves drop off the Endangered Species List, to declare them a predator in 83 percent of the state, which means they can be shot on sight without a license, and in other areas of the state a certain amount of licenses will be available for hunting wolves. And while one can reasonably question the wisdom of hunting a species immediately after it is no longer on the Endangered Species List, the most egregious action being taken by the state is that the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, an NPS unit, is being included in their trophy management plan, which covers the areas that allow for licensed hunting. NPS units are created to preserve our nation's natural and cultural heritage and this includes providing a safe-haven for wildlife that have seen their ranges degraded by development and poor outside management. There is no better example of this need as the gray wolf.It was bad management in the past that led to the original eradication of these beautiful animals. By denying them the protections they deserve in the parkway, which is a vital connecting place for wolves traveling between Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, we could very well be going down that same slippery slope towards driving the population here to a minimum number of wolves, which is only one step away from an accidental eradication.The reintroduction and recovery of the gray wolf to the northern Rockies is one of the greatest conservation success stories in America. In addition to returning a native species to its home, multiple studies have shown that they have had a tremendous impact on restoring the greater Yellowstone ecosystem to the conditions that existed before human intervention disrupted it. They do this by preventing herds from overgrazing the land, reducing overpopulated elk herds, and helping to restore wetlands and riparian areas by keeping ungulates on the move. Additionally, they attract more visitors to our towns and businesses who want to see this graceful animal in its native habitat. These visitors bring money and keep our economies growing; even in these hard times.The Department of the Interior and NPS have the ability to protect the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway from its proposed future as a hunting ground for gray wolves. By making this important park unit off limits to wolf hunting, they will be protecting this area's fragile ecosystem and the economic health of the communities around it that depend on visitors eager to see these animals in their native habitat.National parks are special places; they should serve as safe refuges for native species and especially for those that have just now recovered enough to be taken off the Endangered Species List. When visitors come to Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway they expect to see elk, antelope, bison, deer, and wolves. Wolves are valued as a park species, worthy of the same protections afforded to other predators within national parks. Wyoming may have the right to manage wolves at the most minimal levels, but national parks are the last best refuges for all species and wolf hunting should not take place there."}, {"title": "Project Phoenix, Haiti And International Electric Power Partnership, Hopes To End Sanitation Crisis", "text": "By Earthtechling's Julie Mitchell:Ever since a devastating earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, the country has suffered from a severe sanitation crisis. Especially in the city of Port au Prince where the one garage dump is literally overflowing with waste, and the street are littered with trash. But a new partnership between the government of Haiti and Pittsburgh-based International Electric Power (IEP) is set to help Haiti in its cleanup efforts.Project Phoenix is a public-private agreement between the parties to build a power-generating facility that aims to remove waste from the streets of Port au Prince while decreasing the country\u2019s dependence on foreign fuel. The project is anticipated to create nearly 1,800 jobs for skilled workers and provide 30 megawatts (MW) of green, base-load electric power fueled by municipal solid waste. The new integrated waste management and power plant will be located on 400 acres of land about 10 miles north of the city.Municipal waste will be collected by IEP Waste Management in collaboration with Ros Roca of Spain, Europe\u2019s largest supplier of waste management equipment, and Boucard Waste Management, which has been collecting waste in Port au Prince for more than 20 years.IEP said the new waste management system will use specially designed collection vehicles and segregation equipment developed to collect and process more than 3,000 tons of municipal waste daily throughout the seven municipalities of Port au Prince. Project Phoenix will work in conjunction with Haiti\u2019s government collection service, Service Metropolitain de Collecte des Residus Solides (SMCRS) as well as private waste collectors.The Project Phoenix waste-to-energy plant will be capable of producing 720 megawatt-hours of sustainable electricity per day (that\u2019s running around the clock at 30 MW), enough power for more than 75,000 Haitian households, IEP said. The company touted numerous environmental, social and economic benefits for the country, not the least of which will be an estimated total of close to 10,000 jobs overall.Project Phoenix will seek to eliminate open, low temperature burning of waste and the clogging of canals by years of uncollected plastics, improving water and air quality as well as the health of Haitian citizens. By burning waste in a controlled, high-temperature environment, the project will eliminate the current slow, low temperature incineration of waste in the streets, ridding Port au Prince of dioxins and other airborne toxins. The new waste collection system is planning to start in the fourth quarter of this year.Project Phoenix requires a U.S. investment of approximately $250 million. IEP has assembled an international team of companies to complete the project. Over its anticipated 30 years of operation, the new plant is projected to save the government of Haiti more than $4 billion dollars."}, {"title": "Lamp Recycles Solar Energy As Ambient Light", "text": "The warm breezes of spring will soon give way to the scorching heat of the summer months.

In fact, a new study by the Center for Biological Diversity -- released just in time for Endangered Species Day on May 18 -- finds that of 110 protected species studied, 90 percent are right on track to meet recovery goals set by federal scientists.The Endangered Species Act, signed by President Nixon in 1973, has become America's strongest environmental law. It has saved 99 percent of the 1,482 native species under its care from disappearing forever.But the Act isn't just about avoiding extinction. It's about setting these species on a path to recovery. On that point, there are amazing stories worth celebrating:Aleutian Canada geese, once nearly driven extinct by foxes introduced to their nesting islands in Alaska and by habitat destruction and hunting in California and Oregon, were protected as an endangered species in 1967. Their population grew from 790 birds in 1975 to more than 60,000 in 2005. They've since been taken off the endangered species list -- seven years earlier than expected.Shortnose sturgeon, once found in rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic seaboard, nearly disappeared because of overfishing, river damming, habitat destruction and poor water quality. They were placed on the endangered list in 1967, and now at least five populations have increased, including one in New York's Hudson River that has grown from 2,669 in 1979 to more than 60,000 today.The blue whale population was reduced by as much as 99 percent due to whaling that occurred before the mid-1960s. The number of whales reported off the coast of California, the largest stock in U.S. waters, increased from 704 in 1980 to an estimated 2,497 in 2010.You can find more of these stories at www.ESAsuccess.org.But you wouldn't know the Endangered Species Act is a success at all by listening to some right-wing members of Congress. Many looking to tear it down have deemed it a failure because just 1 percent have recovered to the point where they can be taken off the endangered species list. Their claim simply doesn't meet the smell test, however, for the simple reason that most species protected by the Act that haven't recovered yet were never expected to have recovered yet.Specifically,"}, {"title": "Private Sector Leads on Clean Energy", "text": "This post was co-authored by Anthony J. Orlando and Kate GordonLately, when we hear bad news about the environment -- like the recent EPA study showing America actually increased our greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 after two decades of decline -- the reaction in Washington seems to be to throw up our hands. With all the talk in the media and the halls of Congress lately about what can't be done on energy and climate this year, though, sometimes we forget that in corporate boardrooms at companies all across America, the private sector has been focused on real solutions.Last week, the Center for American Progress came out with a \"solutions menu\" of real options for programs and policies at the federal, state, local and private sector levels that can help produce more clean energy and reduce pollution and waste. What comes through in the report is that the private sector is leading the way toward a cleaner energy future. Across the country, companies are setting internal carbon reduction goals, building more efficient factories, putting up wind and solar panels -- and asking their suppliers to do the same. These actions, especially when they're taken by big companies, are literally changing the energy market in America. They're also making our industries more efficient and more technologically advanced, which is the only way America can compete in a fast-paced global environment.Covanta Energy, for example, is focusing is on helping other companies turn their trash into energy, through a process called \"waste to energy.\" With facilities in Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Lancaster, York and Montgomery counties, Covanta employs more than 300 Pennsylvanians. Nationwide, the company's 40 facilities employ 3,673 Americans and produce enough energy to power over one million homes, while diverting almost 20 million tons of trash from landfills each year. Two-thirds of those homes are located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, making Covanta's affordable power a major part of the region's renewable energy mix.For the companies Covanta works with, turning trash into energy isn't just about good corporate citizenship. Many of these companies do business overseas, including in Europe, where diverting trash from landfills is required by law. Europe cares deeply about trash for a couple reasons: first, landfills in these countries are nearly full, and so there's an immediate need to find other and better ways to deal with trash. But just as important, Europe has greenhouse gas reduction policies in place that require businesses to reduce municipal waste, which gives off high levels of polluting methane gas when it is not repurposed into new energy sources.If the U.S. were to follow Europe's lead and require high levels of recycling and waste to energy recovery, we could reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 650 million metric tons. We'd also promote a whole new business sector in recycling, waste management, and re-use of materials. That's not nothing. But instead, we have yet to come up with a comprehensive energy strategy that addresses global warming, and our largest export continues to be the trash we ship to China each day.But all is not lost. As the CAP report points out, even in the absence of U.S. government action, some big companies are starting to take note that they must step up their game in order to do business in a globalized environment where other countries have passed more forward-looking policies. That's why Siemens, a German company that manufactures a host of energy systems in factories across the U.S., has created an entire internal Sustainability Advisory Board that incorporates carbon-emission reductions into every business decision the company makes. It's why Wal-Mart, the country's single largest private employer, has made a commitment to energy efficiency in its stores and across its supply chain.These business decisions make good economic sense, and they also set a standard for other companies. With luck, they will set a standard for the U.S. government as well. For without a comprehensive national strategy on energy, it will be hard for any but the largest multinational companies to take serious action to reduce emissions and become more sustainable.Anthony J.

Further, investors were highly skeptical that unions could play a constructive role in the turnaround and subsequent growth of our companies.\"The industrial affiliates of the AFL-CIO did something magical at that time. They took reference calls for us reassuring potential investors in KPS of our firm's successful track record in turning around companies, and in the power of working constructively with unions.\"As a result, KPS was able to raise $210 million for its first fund which closed in 1998. Almost fifteen years later, the firm has achieved truly world class investment returns, easily in the top decile globally according to investors, primarily by investing in manufacturing and industrial companies and mostly away from the coasts, thus proving, Psaros quipped, \"that a labor-friendly fund with a card-check policy can invest and make more money than the union-hating investors.\"Now, with almost $2.8 billion of assets under management, KPS' funds have been oversubscribed for years, with blue chip investors from eight countries.PRI in Manufacturing\"A turnaround, at the end of the day, is about sheer force of will.\" Psaros said. He cited the case of HHI, a supplier of forged and machined steel automotive part components with sixteen plants in the Midwest. The company is today comprised of five formerly bankrupt firms that were facing liquidation, that KPS bought, turned around and integrated under new management, headed by Greek immigrant and University of Michigan graduate George Thanopoulos, who brought to the challenge a solid background in manufacturing from his experience at Mascotech Inc.Six years later HHI, whose workers are variously represented by the United Steelworkers (USW), the United Auto Workers (UAW), and The Workers United \"is the among the most profitable auto parts company in the world on a cash flow margin basis and was solidly profitable and cash flowing straight through the automotive crisis in 2008-2009,\" Psaros said. Equally important, he noted, 3,200 jobs were saved and another 1,000 will be hired over the next three years.Pension Fund AlliesOne of the Taft-Hartley pension plans that has invested in KPS funds is the International Association of Machinists (IAM), whose $9-billion pension fund is comprised of public funds, as well as single -- and multi-employer plans.IAM Fund Director Steve Sleigh explained that all three of the union's forms of pension savings \"operate under different regulatory regimes. We're highly regulated. So anything we do for social well being, if it doesn't pay off, we can't invest in it.\"\"Private markets,\" he said, \"give us an opportunity to have relationships, which is a good thing,\" because it allows more direct oversight of developments in the investments in order to ensure that the union can readily meet its obligations to pay pension checks each month to its 83,000 plan participants.\"So what we look for is do-gooders [in the private market] who kick ass on returns,\" Sleigh said, in order to complement the union's commitments to Institutional Investors, whose \"long-term interests are almost the same as workers' interests -- sustainability.\"Public Sector Pensions Investing in ManufacturingPublic employee pension funds have a similar commitment to the sustainability of manufacturing and the manufacturing workforce, explained Bill Atwood, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Investment, which has $11.5 billion under management for 120,000 plan participants.Ensuring the sustainability of manufacturing, Atwood said, \"gives the economy greater stability. Manufacturing in the U.S. is crucial to the economy's long-term sustainability,\" he added, \"and a preeminent principle of sustainability is workforce sustainability.\"\"The demise of the U.S. manufacturing sector is a myth,\" Atwood averred, an assertion echoed by Michael Psaros, who insisted that \"we are still the world's biggest manufacturing power.\"In his management of the Illinois funds, Atwood said that he does not make tactical decisions about public equities, but rather leans heavily toward indexed funds.Where private equity is concerned, he looks for prudent, successful firms that have \"an enlightened view toward workers.\" He noted that \"there is a natural inertia in the private equity world to invest on the coasts.\" Atwood is attracted to Midwestern investments in manufacturing, in part, \"because we need to geographically diversify.\"A more pressing concern with regard to sustainability, he offered, is the preservation of a secure defined-benefit pension system. \"We first and foremost need to determine the long-term viability of Defined Benefit plans. If we continue to let them go away, this discussion about sustainability becomes a fiction.\"DB Pensions Crucial to SustainabilityMichael Musuraca, managing director of Blue Wolf Capital Management, drew on his earlier experience as the designated trustee to the $40 billion New York City Employees Retirement System (NYCERS) to urge that ESG funds learn how to scale up to make it possible for Institutional Investors to meet their obligations and the needs of their retirees.BlueWolf is a private equity firm that looks at companies in some distress where there is government and labor involvement. \"Government,\" he explained, \"is a good client to have and labor union's have an interest in ensuring the long term viability of a company.\"Institutional Investors now realize,\" Musuraca said, \"that they need to call the tune. These pension funds in the long run will not be healthy unless there is a healthy economy.\"He added that the decline in Defined-Benefit pensions is making it harder to aggregate investment capital.Energy Efficiency MattersBob Baugh, Executive Director of the AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Council, offered that energy issues are crucial to manufacturing, thus the importance of climate change.\"CO2 is a problem,\" he acknowledged. \"The question is, how do you address it smartly and strategically. How do you establish policies that are both about jobs and environment.\"A strategy for achieving industrial energy efficiency would be a significant step in the right direction, he suggested, one that has been taken by ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel making company, in cooperation with the United Steelworkers.USW Ohio Director David McCall explained how the union had worked with ArcelorMittal to winnow the entrenched thicket of workplace job classifications as a means of improving productivity while respecting the contribution of the workforce and its acquired knowledge of production processes.\"We had to take a huge, long-term view of sustainability,\" McCall saidThe changes achieved by through these collaborative efforts have reduced man hours incurred in the production of a ton of steel from as much as 2.9 to as little as 1.6. These reductions have massive and profound implications for energy consumption and efficiency. A similar awakening has occurred in the auto industry, where restructuring induced by the government bailout of General Motors and Chrysler has led to some radical restructuring of both work and investment policy, according to Brad Markell, an International Representative in the UAW Research Department.Under the policies development through federal involvement, \"You can now capitalize engineering instead of paying for it out of cash flow. We now have an industrial policy that says, 'Get green, and we will help you get there,'\" an approach that helps reduce the financial and technical risks of green renovation.\"R&D and engineering are not precursers to manufacturing,\" Markell made clear.\"Manufacturing actually pulls the R&D and engineering in.\" As a result, GM is now the number one company in applying for green patents.The Recovery Act resulted in $2 billion in grants that Markell suggested would have near-term impacts on innovation. \"By 2016, we will have 40 percent of lithium battery production in the U.S.\" he concluded.\"We want to anchor capital in our communities,\" Baugh added. \"We also want to anchor innovation in communities.\"Sustaining America's WorkforceMichael Peck, chairman of Isofoton North America, a 60-year-old Spanish solar firm investing in solar facilities in western Ohio, asserted that having a truly sustainable economy guided by ESG principles means changing how the culture views workers.\"Labor is not a commodity,\" he declared. \"Labor is sovereign, and capital, while important, is subordinate to labor. If all we're going to do with the green economy is perpetuate the follies of the past with a green term, then we're not accomplishing anything.\"Putting workers first is profitable,\" he concluded. \"It feels so good when you get through the looking glass to the other side.\""}, {"title": "Pacific Leatherback Turtles: Critically Endangered Species Hurt By Jellyfish Hunt", "text": "By Crystal Gammon, OurAmazingPlanet Contributor:When it comes to leatherback turtles, the world's largest species of sea turtle, there's a conundrum: The species itself is critically endangered, but at least one leatherback population is stable \u2014 on the rise, even \u2014 while others plummet.Now, researchers may have discovered why some of these turtles are doing better than others. Studying two leatherback turtle populations, one that is declining and one that seems to be increasing, the researchers say the answer might be simple: food.\"We saw very big differences in their traveling speeds from their nesting beaches to their foraging grounds,\" said Helen Bailey, an ecologist at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science who led the study. \"We take that to mean one population is stopping to forage on a nice dense patch of prey, while the other group keeps moving because it's constantly in search of food.\"Above photo: The tracks that the different populations of leatherback turtles took in the study.These differences in swimming and eating habits may hold important clues for helping leatherback turtles around the world recover and thrive, Bailey told OurAmazingPlanet.Dine in or drive-through?Atlantic leatherback turtles seem to be doing OK, but the Pacific population could be extinct in the near future, Bailey said.Leatherback turtles everywhere are often victims of bycatch, the unintentional netting and killing of turtles while fishing for other animals, but leatherbacks in the Pacific Ocean face another problem. Climate patterns like the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cause huge variations in temperature and productivity in the Pacific Ocean, making it hard for some animals to find reliable food supplies. These challenges, combined with leatherbacks' advanced breeding age (around 15 years for females), mean that the Pacific leatherback turtle population has taken a serious hit over the last two decades.To figure out the difference between these two groups, Bailey looked at how the turtles swim. Using data from leatherbacks that had been tagged and tracked by satellite, she found that Atlantic leatherbacks have two modes of travel: fast (12-28 miles per day, or 20-45 kilometers per day) and slow (less than 9 miles per day, or 15 km per day). Pacific leatherbacks, on the other hand, have only one: a cruising speed of about 13 miles per day (21 km per day). [In Images: Tagging & Tracking Sea Turtles]Atlantic leatherbacks seem to run from one smorgasbord to another, stopping at a dense patch of jellyfish (their main food source) to eat until it's gone. Pacific leatherbacks never find dense patches of jellyfish, so they swim at the same rather fast speed the whole time, Bailey said.\"They're constantly searching for food,\" Bailey said. \"If you have to keep moving, you're not gaining quite as much energy because even if you manage to eat along the way, you're still expending some energy by traveling.\"In other words, the main difference between the two populations is that Atlantic turtles can dine in and chow down, while Pacific leatherbacks have to settle for the drive-through window and eating on the run.Adults are importantBailey's findings, detailed in the May issue of the journal PLoS ONE, point to new leatherback turtle conservation strategies.\"It's really highlighted very strongly the importance of protecting adult leatherbacks,\" Bailey said in an interview.Because leatherback turtles have long life spans (about 30 years), they've adapted to survive jellyfish shortages by waiting to build nests and lay eggs after they've found a stable food supply. So far, most efforts have focused on protecting leatherbacks' nesting beaches. That's still important, Bailey said, but it may be even more important to protect adult turtles that are old enough to reproduce.\"They really have not adapted in any way to being harvested,\" Bailey said. \"So when adults are killed by, for example, getting caught in fishing nets, then that does have a huge impact on the population and its ability to increase.\"Copyright 2012 OurAmazingPlanet, a TechMediaNetwork company.

It was only the second time the operation had been performed on a shark, according to the BBC.Florence recovered from the surgery and was put on exhibit at Birmingham Sea Life Center, but was never quite the same: Handlers reported that she started avoiding meat and has now gone \"completely veggie.\"Graham Burrows, a curator of the Sea Life Center, said in a press release that caretakers have had to find creative ways of getting Florence proteins and other nutrients missing from her preferred diet.\"We're having to hide pieces of fish inside celery sticks, hollowed out cucumbers and between the leaves of lettuces to get her to eat them,\" Burrows said. \"And it has to be well hidden, because if she realizes it's there she'll ignore the offering and wait for the strictly vegetarian option.\"Burrows said Florence's diet isn't entirely unique -- nurse sharks in the wild have been known to eat a little algae here and there.\u201cWe just weren\u2019t expecting her to go completely veggie.

After all, the religious and secular aspects of our lives intersect in inescapable ways, overlapping in so much of our culture and society.Their joint effects can be seen in our attitudes to so many things, from debates over the question of marriage laws and parenting, to the capitalist, democratic economy that is ours and includes so many socialist overtones via Social Security and Medicare, Medicaid and our views on abortion and contraception, the value of incentives in business or farm subsidies, the justice of our tax system, our care for the environment and ecosystems, the extent of aid we provide developing nations and the reasons we obsess on going to war.One result is that as individuals, we are required to make choices and decisions that strongly affect our happiness, or our ability to pursue what we believe will make us happy. All this in a context in which various churches and the laws of state (and individual states) or the US Constitution, simply collide, affecting our private and public lives on a very regular basis.A second result is that if you're a genuine grown-up, you feel that your catching up with happiness has to really include happiness knowing your brothers and sisters, your fellow citizens (people of other colors, flags and persuasions) will have the exact same opportunity too. Otherwise, there is a kind of disconnect that interferes with our happiness as much as poverty or a bad relationshipSo, maybe we've got to at least look at the happiness aspect of life in this way: it is in many ways obvious that no one would pursue happiness unless they were somehow unhappy or 'lacking in happiness.' And Benjamin Franklin was quoted as saying that the US Constitution \"doesn't guarantee happiness, only the right to pursue it. You have to catch up with it yourself,\" So, if there are schisms and contradictions between your religious beliefs and the state, then without resolving them, it can be difficult to be truly happy about the life you lead.But how about this? Someone once wrote \"There is a wonderful, mystical law of nature that the three things we crave most in life -- happiness, freedom, and peace of mind -- are always attained by giving them to someone else.\" We've been unable discover the identity of the writer, and of course, lots of folks would argue there are other paths to happiness and ways to pursue it. But that's still not the same as finding it.As for freedom and peace of mind, the facts are probably obvious. Anyone who understands anything like the meaning of relativity and how to allow successful relationships to develop and bear fruit, consciously or, at least, unconsciously, knows so.Alternatively, in many ways, whether they admit it or not, such things are a mystery to individuals who are merely out for themselves, their corporation, political party or secular religion, people who are caught up in the pursuit of power or the almighty dollar, or who suffer from emotional and spiritual insecurity or negativity.Well, stating what in today's world might have become a tweet, the twentieth century poet, writer and critic Dorothy Parker once wrote, \"If you want to see what God thinks of money, just look at all the people He gave it to.\"Again, during the same era, social writer Eric Hoffer remarked, \"You can never get enough of what you don't need to make you happy.\"All of which can leave you on the horns of the original dilemma between church and state, socialism versus incentives and a long list of other opposing tendencies that exist in this country (and a slew of other countries) and lead to the question \"How does a grown-up pursue happiness.\" Or if this is God's world, how did it ever get to be this way?As far as happiness goes, can this consideration maybe lead to the conclusion that discovering how to be happy in God's world may amount to understanding all of the above, letting it all go, and trusting the Process?Hell, why not actually practice this notion.

Pretty darn cool, say scientists who work at Antarctica's Mount Erebus, home of one of Earth's only long-lived lava lakes.But it's what's happening underneath that glowing, molten rock that is of even greater interest, and new research is offering intriguing answers to what lies beneath the lake.For the first time, scientists have gotten a glimpse of the rocky plumbing inside the volcano. These geological conduits that pipe molten rock and gas from deep inside the Earth to the lava lake atop the imposing, 12,500-foot (3,800-meter) peak can be seen in a new video.It's the first time seismic interferometry, an imaging technique developed in the last few decades, has been used to peer into a volcano's inner workings, said Julien Chaput, a Ph.D. candidate at New Mexico Tech, and the scientist who led the research, published in the April 14 edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\"It was a crazy afterthought that we'd try this thing and see if it worked on the volcano,\" Chaput said. During the 2007 to 2008 Antarctic field season, a research team had set up more than 90 seismic stations around the upper portions of the mountain for a different experiment, and they decided to try the novel imaging technique as an added bonus. \"It worked quite well, so we got lucky,\" Chaput told OurAmazingPlanet. [Images: The Majestic Transantarctic Mountains]Mountaintop momentThe images revealed that, as many scientists suspected, Mount Erebus's insides are a honeycomb of interconnected pipes and magma chambers that twist and turn through the mountain.\"People have always thought there was this really crazy, tilted conduit system,\" Chaput said. His research appears to confirm that. It revealed at least two sets of geological piping directly below the lava lake, heading in different directions. One is at an angle of about 15 degrees \u2014 almost sideways.\"We managed to highlight that volcanic systems are extremely complicated,\" Chaput said. The work identified many shallow structures inside the mountain that contain pools of magma, but the largest magma chamber, which could be more than 3,000 feet (900 m) across, lies about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) below the summit.\"The deeper you go, the harder it is to see,\" Chaput said. The research allowed them to see the upper 9,500 feet (3,000 m) of the volcano pretty well, \"then it gets fuzzy.\"Forecasting futureThe novel process used in the research offers tantalizing prospects for monitoring other volcanoes \u2014 particularly those that threaten more than just penguins and a handful of Antarctic researchers. Chaput said it could be very useful for imaging the innards of volcanoes in the Cascades Mountains of the Pacific Northwest.Seismic interferometry uses a handy, natural tool \u2014 essentially the volcano's own burps \u2014 as the ink, and seismic stations as the paper to make images of the mountain's insides.Anytime a large enough gas bubble muscles its way through the volcano's plumbing, it produces a burst of energy. That energy glances off the rocky walls of the magma piping inside the volcano. If one wall is at an angle that faces a seismic station, that station makes a note of where that wall is \u2014 a bit like the way a bat bounces sound waves around to figure out where things are, Chaput said.\"The nice thing about this is that you can create images like this any time you get seismic activity of any kind \u2014 which is all the time, with volcanoes,\" Chaput said.The volcano does the work for you. Over time, it gradually adds information to the image, filling in the characteristics of the lava pathways that meander through the mountain.The method offers a way to passively \u2014 and fairly cheaply \u2014 learn about how magma and gas move around inside a volcano, which is key to better understanding what particular brand of violence a volcano may unleash, and when.\"Had they taken an image of Mount St. Helens, they probably would have known it would blow up on the side, instead of the top,\" Chaput said.\"One of the things we need to do if we're going to forecast eruptions is really understand how volcanoes work, and why they erupt the way they do,\" said Clive Oppenheimer, a volcanologist at England's University of Cambridge, who was not associated with Chaput's research. \"That comes down to understanding the plumbing system that brings magma from great depth,\" Oppenheimer told OurAmazingPlanet.Both scientists said that, despite its isolation and the sometimes atrocious conditions, Erebus offers the perfect place to figure that out. It stays active \u2014 but not too active \u2014 allowing scientists to poke and prod a volcano with a beating heart, yet one that is not likely to bite back. [World's Five Most Active Volcanoes]\"The generic understanding we can get from Erebus, and applied to volcanoes worldwide, is very important for identifying why volcanoes erupt the way they do,\" Oppenheimer said, \"and why they can suddenly switch their behavior from peaceful to violent.\"The research was funded by the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. Richard Aster and Philip Kyle, scientists at New Mexico Tech, were integral to its success.Reach Andrea Mustain at amustain@techmedianetwork.com. Follow her on Twitter @AndreaMustain.

At this time in 2011, we were testing our hair for mercury as a way to encourage the EPA to adopt strong mercury pollution protections -- which the agency did. I was also celebrating generating my first clean kilowatt of energy from brand new solar panels on my home.A mere one year later, some jaw-dropping numbers have just come in: In the first quarter of 2012, coal made up just 36 percent of U.S. electricity generation -- down from nearly 45 percent from the same period in 2011. That's a 9 percent drop in U.S. coal use in just one year.The report, released this week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), had even more bad news for big polluters. Electricity generation from coal may drop another 14 percent this year. The EIA also believes coal production will decline 10 percent in 2012.Meanwhile, wind energy is thriving. In the first quarter of 2012, the U.S. installed 1,695 megawatts of wind, one of the industry's best quarters ever, up 53 percent from the same time last year, according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). Wind projects are creating jobs and economic opportunity across the country, with 32 new projects installed in 17 states in the first quarter alone.Also this week, the coal industry released its own report, which clearly reflects the anxiety the industry is feeling. Entitled \"Know Thy Enemy: An Update on the Sierra Club,\" the Kentucky Coal Association singles out the Sierra Club by summarizing our ongoing commitment to see the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act fully enforced to protect the health and livelihoods of Americans. Coal companies and their friends in Congress are spending millions on top of millions to weaken these pillars of environmental protection. Have a look for yourself (pdf). Unfortunately, big polluters would rather spend money on drafting reports like this than protecting our health or investing in clean energy.\"We're flattered that the coal industry would hire lawyers just to 'research' information available on our public website, but it seems like a waste of resources,\" said Tom Pearce, a Sierra Club Kentucky organizer. \"What energy companies should be doing is focusing on how to transition away from dangerous fossil fuels and invest in clean energy and a just transition for workers.\"One key measure that will help that transition is, unfortunately, in jeopardy. Congress has so far failed to renew a key wind energy provision that expires at the end of this year -- the Production Tax Credit, which only Congress can renew. The wind industry is already announcing layoffs and canceled projects as a result of Congress' failure to act, and without congressional action this year, thousands more clean-energy jobs will disappear. That's why extending the tax credit for the wind sector has strong bipartisan support.However, some in Congress aren't listening.

Governments will only put up with rebellion for so long and perhaps Watson has finally pushed them too far? Perhaps it's not a coincidence that the extradition request by Costa Rica was issued the same month (October 2011) as the Japanese lawsuit against Sea Shepherd was initiated.Let's face it, governments, in general are guilty as hell of double-talk pretty much all of the time.We Americans oppose whaling and we have laws against it. Why then does our government, as \"green\" as they appear, sign waivers to allow the Japanese to kill whales every year? The Australian people oppose whaling yet their government does nothing to stop the Japanese from reaping their slaughter within their economic zone. Why? Quite simply: money.Let's hope the German government is wise enough to see through this harassment and release Captain Watson. I understand he was on his way to Cannes, the film festival, obviously on a covert mission to save the earth. He is no danger to anyone except those profiting from the death of our planet. It is better off for all of us that Captain Watson is released and allowed his freedom of travel.The Danish Faeroe Islands are killing whales, the Japanese will continue to take whales in a sanctuary, and Germany holds Watson in jail for bumping a ship flagged to Costa Rica?Do I understand this right?I support law enforcement in some cases, but this is ridiculous. Let the man go free. Let him get back to his business of saving our oceans. Unless you are a whaler, you have to agree. We need whales in order to survive, and I come down with those who believe we don't need so many illegal fishermen, no matter where they come from. I will watch the proceedings in Germany, and others should too. We cannot let legal harassment such as this sidetrack our focus.Let's quit screwing around and free Watson.

Everyone knows how the tobacco industry denied the health risks of cigarettes for decades and continued to lie about the scientifically proven link between smoking and cancer and emphysema for decades, even after their own studies demonstrated the links. The asbestos story was remarkably similar, with industry recklessly deploying the cancer-causing chemical in our homes, workplaces, and even schools long after it knew that asbestos was killing people.But until last week, many people had not heard about fire retardant chemicals, substances that pose serious health threats and that are made by companies who are using the tobacco industry's playbook to maintain their profits at the expense of our children's and families' health.In a stunning four-part series last week, the Chicago Tribune found that the three leading makers of fire retardant chemicals have for decades used deception and phony \"citizen's groups\" to mislead the public, legislators and regulatory agencies about the efficacy and safety of their harmful products. In perhaps the most shocking revelation, the Tribune investigation exposed how the companies indirectly financed a prominent burn doctor who lied to state legislators about child burn victims, in order to falsely portray fire retardants as life-saving substances.Professor Arlene Blum, a visiting scholar in chemistry at the University of California, has called fire retardant chemicals the \"asbestos of our time\" because exposure is widespread and can result in devastating health problems. She notes that exposure to flame retardant chemicals is associated with \"reduced IQ in children, reduced fertility, thyroid impacts, undescended testicles in infants (leading to a higher cancer risk), and decreases in sperm quality and function,\" among other health hazards.The Tribune stories show that for decades the fire retardant companies have been using the tobacco industry's tactics -- and even hired veterans of the tobacco industry's efforts and partnered with the cigarette industry to carry out their dirty tricks campaigns.According to the Tribune, Dr. David Heimbach, a prominent burn doctor, lied in testimony to California legislators about an infant who died from burn injuries to falsely demonstrate that the baby girl could have been saved by fire retardants. When reporters confronted Heimbach with evidence of his lies, the doctor stated that the \"anecdotes\" he related were not \"absolutely true\" but were justified \"because I wasn't under oath.\"Dr. Heimbach acknowledged that he has repeatedly testified about the benefits of fire retardants as a paid consultant for Citizens for Fire Safety (CFS). As the Tribune found (and as CEH wrote about in 2010), this industry front group includes no citizens and cares nothing about fire safety. The phony \"nonprofit\" consists only of the three chemical companies that make the majority of fire retardants sold: Albemarle, Chemtura and ICL Industrial Products. In addition to funding Heimbach's lies, the Tribune exposed how the companies:California's 1975 furniture flammability standard, called TB 117, plays prominently in this national debate because producers of furniture, baby products, and many other everyday items use massive amounts of fire retardants in order to meet this state standard. CEH has actively worked for years to revise this outdated standard and to eliminate all unnecessary uses of fire retardant chemicals. Our policy director attended the hearing where she heard Heimbach's lies -- and she witnessed state legislators buying into the lies, as their committee voted down the reform bill 8-1.The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has found that flame retardants in household furniture are not effective, and has questioned the widespread use of flame retardants in household furniture that can pose unnecessary health risks. In 2008, CPSC proposed a draft standard for furniture flammability that focuses on making upholstery resistant to smoldering cigarettes without chemical retardants, since cigarettes are the largest cause of furniture fires. But until the proposed rule is finalized -- a process that can take several years -- California's outdated regulation remains the de facto national standard.In response to the Tribune series, Illinois Senator Richard Durbin has called on the CPSC to move quickly on finalizing its proposed rule. It's time to end our reliance on this modern-day asbestos, and end the flame retardant industry's tobacco-inspired lies."}, {"title": "Moms Will Lead the Way to Protect Our Kids From Toxic Chemicals", "text": "As the Speaker of the Maine House, I learned how to manage difficult political situations. But today, as the mom of a busy 14 month-old, I now understand that parents must deal every day with challenging political situations and choices -- some nearly as tricky as those elected officials face. Who knew the issue of protecting my family from toxic chemicals would be equally political?Moms deal with the day-to-day negotiating with a child about what to eat. They divide up household and parenting tasks with spouses and families. They carefully steer through the conversations with friends and relatives about parenting styles. They make decisions about how to discipline their kids, and they manage the nearly impossible task of balancing work and home life.I understood in political life that moms were among the best spokespeople when it came to convincing a state house committee to pass a bill. And they were almost always effective and to the point when it came to telling their representative what was on their mind.No politician wants to be on the wrong side of moms when it comes to lobbying for greater protections for their kids. The more I spend time with fellow moms, and as the maternal instinct has kicked in for me, I realize there is nothing more powerful on a mom on a mission -- especially a mission to protect her family.That is exactly what has motivated the movement to put common sense limits on toxic chemicals and join next week's National Stroller Brigade. The presence of unregulated toxic chemicals in our food, consumer products, air, and water -- and the dangers those chemicals pose, particularly to children -- have galvanized mothers across the country, even those who normally avoid political causes.Toxic chemicals are virtually unregulated in this country. The only significant law to protect consumers from toxics hasn't been updated since the Ford Administration. In the meantime, use of chemicals in consumer products -- and families' exposure to those chemicals -- has increased tremendously. In order to monitor the safety of the products in the average American home, consumers would have to navigate an impossible maze of chemical names, limited ingredient disclosure, and mixed information.As a new mom trying to search for safe products for my baby, I quickly learned that there are no labels that tell you what is safe and what could be dangerous for your baby. From nursing pillows and car seats laden with toxic flame retardants, food cans lined with the endocrine disruptor BPA, and baby shampoo that contains formaldehyde -- parents quickly learn that what should be safe often is not. They also learn that -- despite the endless rhetoric from huge corporations about 'regulation' -- there is no current law that requires companies to perform even the most basic safety testing of the chemicals used in common household products.Meanwhile, alarming health trends are on the rise. Learning and developmental disabilities, infertility, and childhood and young adult cancers are on the rise. Some are even calling puberty at ten the new \"normal.\" And numerous studies link these trends to environmental factors such as chemical exposure.Tired of navigating this chemical laden maze, moms have taken to the streets to tell Congress they are sick of the status quo. Contrary to recent reporting by the New York Times, which portrayed this issue as a small group of \"wealthy\", \"neurotic\" women, toxic chemicals are making moms across the political and democratic spectrum vocal and politically active.In the last six months, Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families has coordinated over 30 mom-led \"stroller brigades\" in cities across the country. Moms met in local parks with their kids in tow, made signs, spoke out, and wrote letters to their Senators asking Congress to pass Senator Frank Lautenberg's Safe Chemicals Act.In addition, celebrity moms like Jessica Alba are getting political about health and environmental issues. Alba became Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families' spokesperson last year, and has since launched The Honest Co., a new business dedicated to non-toxic products for kids.The political potency of moms and the success of the \"stroller brigades\" has inspired us to pull together an event in Washington D.C. On May 22nd, the National Stroller Brigade will feature moms, cancer survivors and other health-affected leaders in a march on Washington demanding passage of the Safe Chemicals Act.We know that this country is on the wrong track when it comes to our health. Toxic chemicals are only one piece of the equation, but they are the piece we can do something about today. Please join us for this big event to show Congress that whether you're a mom, young adult, nurse or cancer survivor -- or you've got one in your family -- you are fired up and demanding action.These days, political leaders too often seem paralyzed by our broken political system. Many Americans have lost faith in the ability of people to make change. But I still have faith that leaders on both sides of the aisle will recognize that following the lead of America's moms only makes sense. The health of our kids and families depends on it.For more information on the National Stroller Brigade please visit our website at www.saferchemicals.org"}, {"title": "California Is Leading: Will the Nation Follow?", "text": "What do the iPhone, the silicone breast implant and the solar panel have in common?Each has the most users in California. The companies that designed and marketed them are here, too.California is the state of cutting edge, of firsts. We're Hollywood, Silicon Valley, gay rights, the first female Speaker of the House and the first Sierra Club. It's why I moved here from the Midwest. The sense of excitement, that anything is possible.Now California is going first on climate change. There's a lot hanging in the balance. So far, Congress has failed to take meaningful action on the issue. Two weeks ago, the International Energy Agency scolded governments across the world for doing too little, with the organization's executive director warning: \"The world's energy system is being pushed to breaking point.\"Instead of taking steps to become more sustainable, many countries are accelerating their use of fossil fuels and unsustainable consumption patterns. Emissions have been rising, not declining, and the current course of climate change could result in temperatures rising 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2052 and 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.California is planning to counteract those trends with investment in three important areas: \u2022 Greater energy efficiencies \u2022 Renewable and zero-emission electricity sources \u2022 Lower pollution from automobiles.Measures to reduce energy waste and improve efficiency include new appliance standards, new efficiency standards for buildings and new technologies. In electricity, the state will produce fully one third of its power from solar, wind and other renewable sources. In the transportation sector, a major source of air pollution, cars will be mandated to become more efficient and the use of low-carbon fuels will be phased in.California will also introduce the second largest cap and trade program in the world -- the biggest is in Europe -- starting in January 2013. Under cap and trade, pollution permits are auctioned to the highest bidder, and a business can either buy a pollution permit or reduce its emissions through a specific action.All of this and more is happening under AB32, California's pioneering legislation passed in 2006. It's the most important piece of legislation of its kind in the U.S., as it stands to shape the course of national and international action on climate change and the broader issue of sustainability.Although AB32 is often viewed as environmental legislation, it's much more. Under the law, we're not just cutting carbon, we're moving toward a sustainable society and improving our well-being by reducing pollution and the amount of resources we consume, including water and energy.Here are a few reasons from the recent news cycle on why all this is so important (there are many more):A group of scientists from the University of California of Santa Barbara published a new study in Nature, indicating that species loss significantly impacts ecosystem productivity and is a major player in environmental change. According to the scientists, continued species loss could precipitate a mass extinction.Edward Humes, author of Garbology, told National Public Radio that globally we dump the equivalent of 40 aircraft carriers of plastic into our oceans every year, and that amount is increasing. Plastic from overflowing landfills and household trash ends up in our oceans, breaks down, absorbs toxic chemicals and gets eaten by fish we buy in markets and restaurants.And just last week, Lynne Peeples, who writes about the environment and public health, told us about the recent asthma-related deaths of two Georgia children, Kellen Bolden, 10, and Brennan Passons, 11. Nearly one in ten children now suffer from asthma due in large part to air pollution that can be addressed through cleaner energy sources.The success of AB32 will determine whether other states, our national government (which has rejected cap and trade legislation), and other nations follow California's lead. If they do, we could finally be on a path that scientists have long advocated: to reduce global emissions below 1990 level. Equally importantly, we'll be on a path to some measure of global sustainability, using less energy and water and producing less waste. California is the only experiment of this size anywhere in the world under a single government.America needs to lead. We use the most energy. We use the most resources. And we generate more trash than anyone else on the planet (7 pounds per person each day, according to Humes).It's not that we don't know how to do it. We do already.

Rio+20 Enviromentalists Team With #OWS", "text": "I imagine that in the Main Street Media, this will be billed as, \"Tree Huggers Meet Wall Street Bashers.\"You can be certain that something close to this will be the spin put on the conjoining of the still-fledgling Occupy Movement with the veterans of the environmental movement -- the latter now gaining its second breath and much traction.What's the fuss?Occupy is rallying its foot soldiers as well as a major online army to see that the upcoming U.N. Rio+20 Earth Summit on the environment will get the sort of press and attention once reserved for Zuccotti Park. It is only logical that a movement galvanized in South America some 20 years ago might need \"buzz\" to make it current and relevant.For those not readily familiar with Rio+20, this was the historic 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro. It has been acknowledged as a key milestone in placing sustainable development as a top priority for the international community.How does the Occupy Movement figure in this picture two decades down the road? Both are being either under-reported or poorly reported, and both are met with tepid enthusiasm or even resistance, no matter how important their struggles.Whether it be saving a rainforest or saving a foreclosed home, the need is the same: something is terribly wrong and the word must be gotten out, and strong action applied.If you are an environmentalist -- the upcoming Rio+20 Conference on June 20-22 is a hot topic. If you are an occupier, helping these two movements merge and help each other grow will be your hot topic.At least, that's the view of Ted Schulman, who is both an Occupier and an Environmentalist and a man who has always inhabited interesting -- if opposing -- worlds. At one time a member of the \"Mad Men\" culture we see pictured on HBO, Ted managed a technology group for TBWA\\Chiat\\Day, the global ad agency known for campaigns for Apple Computer, Absolut, Nissan, Pepsi, and Visa.Along the way, he also was instrumental in creating an award winning interactive technology demonstration project, The Learning Center at Ellis Island, and HarlemNYC.US as an example online community developed for New York State's application as a Federal Empowerment Zone.Living in the Wall Street area, it was easy for him to walk two blocks over to be one of the very first \"citizens\" of the Occupy world at Zuccotti Park in September, 2011. Being someone who understood both business and societal needs (his degree is in Social Anthropology) and one who also honed his tech skills at the Ad Agency, he set about with people like Deven Balkind and Drew Hornbein, \"kids\" 20 years his junios to create a \"TechOps\" group. Naturally, it was informed by work he had done previously in the sustainability world.Ted thus far has managed to weave together the two worlds of climate and financial concerns. In a very symbolic, if not real sense, the arctic meltdown has its equivalency in the Wall Street Collapse and that action must be taken. And, he is working hard with people here in the U.S. and around the world to see that this awareness is brought to the general population.The chosen vehicle is the Earth Summit called RIO+20, and likely a People's Summit to take place in the southern Hemisphere. \"It could be transformative,\" Ted believes, and is laboring to bring about an online forum for people to vote on economic as well as climate actions -- actually a \"first layer of a consensus system\" as pioneered in the Occupy General Assemblies.The logical and now forthcoming fruits of all this? \"Occupy Climate,\" of course.For those wanting more information on this and how to join the \"communities of practice\" that will focus on collaboration and innovation between OWS and Rio+20, more details can be found at: www.OccupyTheEarth.net, or by contacting Ted at his company, www.Transcoms.com.A more detailed \"15 Minutes of Fact\" oral interview with Ted Schulman can be found at: http://bit.ly/JeYNju."}, {"title": "Brazil's Jubarte Field Oil Spill Under Navy Investigation", "text": "* Reports said stain found in Petrobras offshore field* ANP says navy overflights turn up no sign of oil stain* Petrobras says it \"confirmed normality of operations\"* Petrobras reported problem in oil field Wednesday -IbamaBRASILIA, May 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-owned oil company Petrobras, its navy, and oil industry regulators rushed to investigate multiple reports of an oil leak from an offshore field on Thursday, but said they found no signs of oil in the water.Petrobras itself had raised the alarm on Wednesday, reporting an oil problem near the giant P-57 oil production ship in the Jubarte field, Brazil's environmental protection agency Ibama said.The navy said it received reports on the spill as early as Wednesday, and the Folha de Sao Paulo daily newspaper said oil workers reported a 1 km (0.6 mile) long oil stain near the P-57 when they returned from their shifts at sea.Boats and aircraft were deployed to investigate, but found nothing.\"After news of a supposed stain near the P-57, there resulted this afternoon a verification on location that confirmed the normality of operations in the region,\" Petrobras said late on Thursday.It added that \"all its control systems on production and drilling units off the coast of Espirito Santo state are operating within the parameters of normality.\"A leader of the union that represents workers on the P-57 told Reuters a small spill could have dispersed before a formal inspection took place.\"It's almost impossible to imagine that Petrobras would have informed Ibama of something if they didn't at least see oil in the water,\" said Valnisio Hoffman, head of administration at Sindipetro Espirito Santo union. \"You don't report something that's not there.\"A Petrobras spokeswoman declined to confirm or deny whether Petrobras informed Ibama of a spill on Wednesday.Hoffman, who has worked on the P-57 and is in regular contact with its principal officers, said it was unlikely that a leak came from the huge production ship, known as an FPSO. Oil or petroleum-based drilling fluid may have leaked from nearby drilling platforms or from other FPSOs, he said.There are two additional Petrobras production ships and a drilling rig on lease to Petrobras from Switzerland-based Noble Corp. within six to 10 km of the P-57.Oil-fueled service and cargo ships regularly dock with the vessels or pass through the field, 85 km from shore. Jubarte sits astride one the busiest marine areas on Brazil's coast.Jubarte produced 196,000 barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent per day (boepd) in February, or about 8 percent of Brazil's total output of 2.63 million boepd, according to Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP.DEEP CHALLENGESTo tap its growing reserves, Petrobras plans to spend about $225 billion over five years to more than double output to about 6 million boepd in 2020. The vast majority of that oil will come from offshore fields such as Jubarte near Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.Recent spills, though, have cast a spotlight on Brazil's ambitious plans and its capacity to develop its giant, but technically challenging deepwater fields.Discoveries over the past five years rank among the largest anywhere in the last three decades and could allow Brazil to leapfrog the United States as the world's third-biggest oil producer. They are also in some of the deepest seas ever considered for oil development.A spill in the Frade field south of Jubarte in November led to civil lawsuits seeking about $20 billion in damages and criminal charges against Chevron, which operates the field, as well as Transocean, its drilling contractor, and 17 of the two companies' employees.Chevron and its partners in the field decided to shut down output in Frade after additional, unexplained leaks were found in field waters in March. Frade produced 64,000 barrels a day of oil in February, the ANP said.Chevron and Transocean deny any wrongdoing. Chevron owns 52 percent of Frade and Petrobras owns 30 percent. The rest is owned by a Japanese group led by Inpex and Sojitz Corp .Petrobras said on Thursday it is unlikely Frade will be shut permanently, and that a reopening is likely after resolving the causes of the November spill.Petrobras preferred shares, the company's most-traded class of stock, fell 4.46 percent to 18.43 reais in Sao Paulo, its lowest since October.

As a city-raised kid, I was always looking for any reason to get out into nature. Being involved in Audubon as a bird watcher or Boy Scouts or just on my own, I always felt at peace in nature and saw nature as my teacher. I was lucky enough to spend summertime on farms and could easily see the connection to nature that farming offers.Coming of age in the advent of the 'ecology' movement, I quickly transferred my love for nature to my commitment to protecting nature. At the same time, I joined in the back to the land movement of the early '70s and reunited with the farm community. I was deeply attracted to agriculture as a community and as a wealth of common sense. Once I discovered organic agriculture, I found my life mission to serve family farm agriculture by promoting organic farming.I have long admired the work of NRDC and so appreciate that they include food as a theme in their role to protect our natural resources. Agriculture affects a major portion of land in the U.S. and World, utilizing an estimated 70 percent of our resources. Food and agriculture must be a large focus of the environmental movement. Indeed, one could say we could eat our way through major threats by eating food that is grown with respect to nature.Organic Valley represents a pioneering effort of farmers and employees to bring organic foods and farming to a level of maturity that can compete, at all levels, with chemical-based agriculture. Organic is not only about not using chemicals, but really about working with nature to prevent problems and maximize synergy between the many elements of a farm with nature. 'Organic' is an old word whose roots are in 'the parts working together' and was a branch of philosophy in Greek times. This philosophy says collective action can change the world, which has been an inspiration to my life.At Organic Valley, 'organic' is a word that is bigger than the USDA food seal and represents a philosophy that future lifestyles will be based on. We are seeing a sweeping lifestyle change amongst our young people, where values are driving their lives and not the goal of financial success. Recently on a trip to Europe, I read about the 'post-materialism' movement, which excited me to see yet another term for what I see as the growth of the organic lifestyle.Working as the CEO of CROPP Cooperative, the nation's largest farmer-owned cooperative, has been a mission to connect farmers and consumers through our brands of organic foods: Organic Valley and Organic Prairie. As a mission-based business, we have been stubborn to live by our values, and we have been rewarded for it. As we approach our 25th year, we are a pioneer in the organic field with close to 10 percent of all organic farmers in the U.S. located in more than 35 states. We will be over $850 million in 2012, serving more than 1,700 organic farmers, who produce the best food products possible through organic production, high quality standards and the best taste on the market. Our 650 employees are a huge part of our success and enjoy great satisfaction in the meaningful work that we have together. Our cooperative has a profit sharing program that shares the profits with the farmers and the employees. I have often said that we are a 'social experiment disguised as a business' -- after all, how do you run a business organically?  Since our founding in 1988, Organic Valley has had the real job of aiding farmers in going organic, building an infrastructure to serve those farmers and their production, and managing the products and customer relationships. Today, we continue building the infrastructure to support organic agriculture. We are constantly educating potential new organic farmers, as well as supporting those who have already committed. As the market outstrips the supply, we are focused on transitioning more farmland to organic and keeping the land that is already organic in organic production. Working toward the latter goal, we created the Generation Organic\u2122 (Gen-O\u2122) program to provide leadership training, marketing education and farming mentorship for the next generation of CROPP farmer-owners. These young farmers will eventually take over their parents' farms and become the new leaders of our cooperative business. Supporting the next generation of organic farmers is a vital endeavor within our business and the organic community.Having reached the success we have today, Organic Valley has the resources to lead and support the organic and related food and environmental movements. We are very active in the struggle against biotechnology in agriculture, forced upon us by large corporations and cooperating government agencies. We are pleased with the \"Just label It\" movement, which gained one million signatures calling for mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods so consumers can make their own choice. Organic Valley has been active from the beginning in the development and implementation the organic standards within the USDA to protect the integrity of the organic label. I am really proud of the leadership from the Organic Valley farmers who started a volunteer fund that grants more than $500,000 each year to organizations who advocate, research and educate about organic foods. Clearly Organic Valley has been able to leverage its business to be a change agent in defense of our natural resources.My vision is one where food becomes a central part of our lives. As a social force, we all know the value of a family or community meal. Food is a real way to stay connected to the Earth. Having hands in the Earth to grow your own food is the best source of food for your body and spirit. Buying foods at a local farmers market or being part of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a great way to influence your local region while enjoying great food and educating your family. Foraging wild foods or putting away food by canning or freezing is another great focus and hobby that pays dividends in many ways. To grow this connection to food and the Earth, Organic Valley even started a great new tradition to add a dinner to the celebration of Earth Day -- it's called Earth Dinner\u2122 and it's an exciting new statement to recognize the importance of food in respecting the Earth.We live in a time of change; yet when we look at world affairs, it is confusing to see how we can effect change. This is the beauty of supporting organic farming and family farms: it is a clear personal path that tremendously benefits our social and environmental well-being, with huge implications for personal satisfaction and health. Not to mention the bonus of great food that we get to enjoy and share."}, {"title": "Burning Old Computers Threatens Ghana's Health", "text": "Not far from the heart of one of Africa's biggest cities, Accra, Ghana, black clouds of toxic smoke rise from an outdoor recycling operation that is converting America's used computers into copper, gold and other useful materials.  The Agbogbloshie Market is also poisoning thousands of people who work and live at the outdoor inferno as well as many more of the city's 2.3 million people downwind of the smoke. The city's largest outdoor food market lies directly in the path of the smoke, adding to concerns.  But now a team of American researchers and experts has come up with a simple plan to end the burning and help 1,000 young people who depend on the recycling market for income continue their jobs without creating health hazards for themselves, their neighbors and future generations. The recycling is feeding thousands of people.  The smoke contains \"significant\" traces of arsenic, copper, chromium and the \"scary\" carcinogens dioxins, according to Hunter College public health professor Jack Caravanos. He recently visited Accra where he said a project has begun to test the blood and urine of people living near Agbogbloshie Market's inferno of smoldering laptops, printers and CD boom boxes.The site has \"extensive lead contamination in both ambient air and topsoil,\" Caravanos wrote in a published report. \"Given the urban nature of this site as well as the large adjacent food distribution market, the potential for human health impact is substantial both to workers and local residents.\"Economic reality lies behind the toxic burning. Computers are filled with costly copper wires that need to be stripped of their plastic sheathing. The easiest way to do this is to set fire to the electronics items.Caravanos, program director of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at Hunter, brought two of his students with him to try and figure out a better way to strip the wires without fire.He brought over a few dozen varieties of wire strippers readily available for a few bucks each at any U.S. hardware store. The students showed the Ghanaian youths how to use the tools to strip the plastic without burning.   \"They really got into it, and it is promising,\" said Caravanos. \"If they will change their ways and produce clean cooper not charred copper, they'll get more money -- $3 per pound instead of $2.\"In addition, by not burning the plastic, the operation takes place without releasing toxic smoke.The Hunter professor, who works with the New York-based NGO Blacksmith Institute, thinks that the scavengers could actually increase their income by selling recycled plastic sheathing and clean copper while at the same time improving the health of tens of thousands of people.  Agbogbloshie is about the size of Central Park Lake and produces about 1,000 pounds of copper per day. Much of the waste electronics found there is shipped in containers sent from Europe while most American electronic waste goes to China.Some of the hard drives in old computers have reportedly been examined by Ghanaians who recovered names, passwords, bank accounts and other information that could be used for fraud and theft.But the most shocking aspect of the enterprise is the large levels of toxic lead, arsenic and other substances released into the soil and air.The government has said it wants to simply shut down the whole operation but Blacksmith figures it will just start up somewhere else. So the NGO is working with the greater Accra Recyclers Association to try out wire strippers and other innovations.  There is a long term plan to use bulldozers and trucks to remove the top 8 to 10 inches of soil which is laden with heavy metals, and place it in a protected storage.  Blacksmith is also working with two teams of six recyclers: one team will use wire strippers instead of burning and the other will continue with the old method of burning.

As a result, Norway carved out a jagged shape that included Ekofisk, which has proved to be a major field, and Denmark was left with the dregs.Regarded as a model of how to spend oil and gas wealth wisely, Norway has stashed away surplus revenues from exports while hydropower caters for the bulk of its domestic electricity needs.But Denmark has also found its own path to energy pragmatism, supplementing its relatively few oil rigs with wind turbines and a deep commitment to energy saving.As awareness has grown, cities like Copenhagen and some of the nation's hundreds of islands are vying for the accolade of \"zero carbon\" while Danes from across the social spectrum can tell you how much energy they use to the kilowatt.Keeping up with the Joneses - or in this case Christensens - is all about using less fuel and having better solar panels.\"We get a bit competitive with our neighbours,\" said Kalle Christensen, a computer engineer, who lives in a low-energy house in Stenlose South, just outside Copenhagen.His is one of some 400 low-energy houses in a community expected to grow to at least 750. He said he was looking into buying solar panels that would allow him to sell more power back to the grid, although he already expects energy savings will more than make up the roughly 10,000 euro ($13,300) difference in price between his low-energy home and a standard house.Stenlose South has the highest concentration of such homes, but low-energy houses are a growing trend across Denmark, which enforces strict efficiency standards on new building.Together with his wife Anne Godiksen, a chemist, and two young children, Christensen uses around 5,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year compared with the 25,000 needed in their previous house.Insulated walls, reinforced glass windows and technology tucked away in a control room ensure a constant temperature and re-use of heat from appliances. When it was minus 15 degrees Celsius outside last winter, it was a toasty 22 degrees inside.Their neighbours are retired police inspector Ove Bendtsen and his wife Hanne Beer.The couple had considered moving to a retirement village but Beer, a former municipal worker, had heard about the low-energy housing project through her job.Surrounded by young kilowatt-counters, they now have no anxiety about utilities bills and no need to buy water softener for the washing machine that runs on collected rain water. \"There are only advantages,\" Beer said.OIL CRISISFor Denmark as a whole, the real energy sobering-up began in the 1970s when prices surged in the first oil crisis and the nation found itself almost 100 percent dependent on fossil fuel.Now a world leader in wind power, Denmark gets a quarter of its electricity from wind and aims to increase that share to 50 percent by 2020.As holder of the EU presidency until the end of June, the Danes are championing energy saving and green growth in the region, but convincing others can be a problem.In principle, all 27 EU nations have backed a target to cut energy use by 20 percent by 2020, but in practice they balk at any upfront investment, even for building measures that create jobs and ultimately cut bills.Harassed finance ministers tend to be the toughest opponents. In Denmark, however, a cross-party, low-carbon consensus extends to every government department. The finance minister backs green growth as heartily as the environment minister.\"If we don't invest, it will be more expensive,\" Danish Economic and Interior Minister Margrethe Vestager told Reuters when asked about energy savings measures and renewables. \"For us, the alternative to renewables is still higher oil prices.\"High taxes for fossil fuel - such as 75 percent tax on heating oil - have helped to convince the Danish general public, while for business a stable regime of subsidies, feed-in tariffs and tax-deductible green investment has spurred renewables.State-owned oil, gas and power company DONG still derives the bulk of its earnings from fossil fuel, driven by high oil prices, and green groups criticise Denmark for continued use of carbon-intensive coal.In contrast to oil majors that have dipped into renewables but so far stuck with the fossil fuel business model they trust, however, DONG issues separate figures for green power and they show rising earnings from wind.Between 2007 and 2011, profits from wind grew by nearly 200 percent from 81 million euro to 240 million, while the exploration and production sector rose nearly 140 percent from 321 million euros to 758 million.GREEN COMPETITIONThe Danish government has fostered a domestic green rivalry.A national competition in 1997 selected Samso - between the island of Zealand and the Jutland peninsula - to become Denmark's first carbon-neutral island.By 2005, Samso had achieved the goal, and the 114-sq-km island, with a dwindling population of around 4,000, is now a net exporter of green power, which means the fossil fuel it uses on ferry journeys and other transport is offset.Burning wood chips, old blackcurrant bushes and straw in furnaces provide district heating. The island's farmers are also wind farmers.At Tyregaarden Farm, Jorgen Tranberg, who has 100 hectares and 130 dairy cows, proudly leads visitors into the base of his wind turbine where dials indicate how much power is being generated. What interests him are the hard economics.\"I sell more electricity than milk,\" he said. \"There's no bad weather, if the wind's blowing.\"Tranberg bought his wind turbine 12 years ago. It produces 2.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year - enough, he says, for 35 farms like his.In seven years, he recouped the 6 million Danish crowns ($1.07 million) cost.Tranberg also bought half of an offshore wind turbine in 2003 for 12 million crowns. Gigantic offshore turbines are much more expensive to buy and maintain than onshore - Tranberg faced a 4 million crowns repair bill when a gear box failed - but they also generate much more power.In all, he sells 6.5 million kilowatts every year along with 1.4 million litres of milk.NOW, THE HARD PARTTranberg and others on Samso, who invested at the right time with the help of subsidies and tax incentives, are the lucky ones.Agriculture Minister Mette Gjerskov is frank about the debts crippling many Danish farmers, debts that can be due partly to spending on renewable energy.Even for those who have got it right, building on the progress will be hard: the global economic downturn and credit crisis mean finding the funds for shrewd, long-term investment is harder than ever, and the obvious changes have been made.\"It's getting more and more difficult. It was difficult in the beginning because people rejected it. In the end they realised that this was not dangerous,\" said Soren Hermansen, chief executive officer of the Samso Energy Academy, summing up the Samso experience.\"We had really good development of the project, but now we have done the easy things.\"The next step is to aim to be not just carbon-neutral, but carbon-free, which means tackling the issue of how to escape dependence on transport fuel.Hermansen drives an electric car, but electric transport technology is still immature and more widespread development will require investment in power grid infrastructure.The Energy Academy, which has become a magnet for \"energy tourists\" from all over the world, is working on solutions to these problems.Hermansen has not lost his optimism that \"radical changes \" r emain possible, including Copenhagen's dream of becoming the world's first carbon neutral capital by 2025. For Denmark's centre-left government, becoming ever greener is non-negotiable.\"In spite of our economic crisis, the green economy is not just one way forward, it is the only way forward,\" Ida Auken, Denmark's environment minister, told journalists in April."}, {"title": "A Bright Future for Renewable Energy", "text": "The current market for the renewable energy sector in the United States and around the world is a mix of challenge and opportunity. However, the long-term future of clean energy is bright.According to our recent report, \"Who's Winning the Clean Energy Race? 2011 Edition,\" last year saw record private investments globally. And the United States received more investments for clean energy than any other nation. These investments resulted in record deployment levels -- 83.5 gig watts of clean generating capacity overall, including an unprecedented 30 gig watts of solar.But like other emerging high-technology industries before it, the clean-energy sector is going through a period of profound transition. The industry faces powerful financial and policy cross currents.The most important long-term dynamic in this sector is falling prices. Both wind and solar have experienced sustained and dramatic price declines. Solar module prices dropped 50 percent in 2011. Wind prices were down 10 percent. Lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles are down 30 percent over the past three years and fell 14 percent just last year.These price declines are good news for consumers and help explain last year's record deployments. Yet falling prices are putting manufacturers through a period of turmoil in the United States and elsewhere. Many are hard-pressed to make a profit and scrambling to remain viable. A number will fail, just as the more than 100 automakers in the early 20th century were whittled down to only a few American auto producers.This turmoil facing clean energy manufacturers is exacerbated by policy uncertainty in the most established and mature markets. Financial incentives in Europe are being curtailed in the push for budget austerity. In the United States, a variety of initiatives, passed as part of the stimulus package, expired at the end of 2011, and the production tax credit that has guided investors in wind projects is set to conclude at the end of this year.But these challenges will pass, and clean energy will continue its inexorable march forward -- pushing innovation into an energy sector that has not seen much in the way of new technologies for more than 100 years. Renewable power will soon be cost-competitive. Indeed, a range of financial and technical experts expect solar and wind to compete favorably without subsidies of any kind within this decade and perhaps in the next five years.Similarly, U.S. policy uncertainty will not deter other markets from flourishing. China, India, Brazil, and other emerging economies have strong and consistent clean energy policies to encourage private investment in and deployment of clean energy. These are the markets where most of the 2 billion people without modern energy services live and where demand growth will be greatest in the next 20 to 30 years. Clean energy offers African countries, for example, the opportunity to provide electricity to households and communities without transmission wires, just as cell phones allowed that continent to leapfrog landline phones. Residential solar already is the cheapest energy option in many parts of the world.For American policymakers, the question is not whether clean energy will be part of the world's energy future. It is and will be. The question is whether the United States will capitalize on its advantages in clean energy innovation and position itself to use, produce, and sell them to consumers looking for safe, clean, affordable energy options in the future. The hearing this week on the proposed Clean Energy Standard (CES) is an important step. Although the legislation is unlikely to move to the Senate floor for debate, a CES is the type of long-term policy needed in this country.We have a choice. Continue our current complacency and watch others seize the economic and national security benefits of clean energy, such as job growth and competitiveness. Or renew the production tax credit, pass a clean energy standard, and support innovators, entrepreneurs, and industry in developing the world's most advanced, cost-competitive clean energy technologies for Americans to use and export around the world."}, {"title": "Earth Warming by the Day... and the Month... and the Year...", "text": "A trend is defined as \"a prevailing tendency or inclination.\" See if the following strikes you as a trend: The warmest January-April period on record was part of the warmest 12-month period on record, which was preceded by the warmest calendar year on record, which immediately followed the warmest decade on record.I see a trend -- it's getting freaking' HOT!

The map in the video changes from a refreshing blue (lower than average temperatures) to a an uncomfortable orange (higher than average). You can even see the warming accelerate in the late 20th century as man's greenhouse gas emissions increased.Yet while the trend towards a warming planet marches on, the trend in people's belief that our climate is changing may be no trend at all. The public at large seems to say, \"Climate change is a problem, except that it's not because the planet's not warming -- but now I think it is... but people don't cause it, except that they actually do.\"Just think: if we killed off a few trees and said \"boil\" constantly, maybe everyone would get on the program.If people can be influenced by a hot day, why can't they be influenced by a time-lapse video showing 131 years of progressively hotter days?

Many are inexpensive horses racing with little regulatory protection in pursuit of bigger and bigger prizes. These deaths often go unexamined, the bodies shipped to rendering plants and landfills rather than to pathologists who might have discovered why the horses broke down.\"Back in January, undercover video obtained by the Humane Society led to legal action after the footage revealed alleged inhumane treatment at Seaboard Foods, a pig breeding facility tied to Wal-Mart.The video showed the pigs crammed into crates with torn noses, ears, and other wounds.The facility is one of the country's largest producers -- processing around 4 million hogs each year, or about 18,500 every day."}, {"title": "Lead Poisoning Threshold Lowered By CDC, Five Times More Children Now Considered At Risk", "text": "The number of children considered at risk of lead poisoning jumped by more than five-fold on Wednesday, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its threshold for the diagnosis.Children's health advocates applauded the decision, but also expressed concern that recent congressional budget cuts will drastically limit funds that could help affected kids and prevent further poisoning.\"It's a sad irony,\" said Ruth Ann Norton, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning.In January, a CDC advisory panel recommended that the threshold at which a child is deemed to have lead poisoning should be cut in half, from 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood to 5. By accepting the panel's recommendation, the CDC now effectively increases the number of children under age 6 with elevated blood lead levels from approximately 77,000 to 442,000.Rather than a doctor telling parents that their child's blood lead test \"came back negative\" when, say, the result is 7 micrograms, now those parents will be armed with information that might help them monitor and reduce further exposures.Among Norton's recommendations: removing old leaded windows, repairing paint that is chipping or peeling, using a HEPA vacuum and keeping kids' hands washed.\"We are dealing much more frankly with parents about the threats that lead poses to their children,\" she said. \"For generations we've allowed families to think their children were safe, while in fact they were being impaired by lead.\"Experts emphasize that the new level remains more or less arbitrary. \"There is no safe level,\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of the department of preventative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \"Lead is toxic to the developing brain at low levels. Prenatal exposure causes brain damage. Exposure to an infant or toddler causes brain damage.\"\"But none of us is pushing for a zero standard,\" he added. \"That's just not doable. There's too much lead in today's world.\"An estimated 38 million homes in the U.S. still have lead-based paint, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).The main source of children's lead exposure remains the flakes and dust generated by lead-based paint, which can settle on everything from windowsills to toys. Young children who spend a lot of time crawling on the ground and putting things in their mouths are particularly prone to exposure. The effects can turn up years later in the form of behavior problems, lower IQ, even heart and reproductive problems.Lead-removal programs have made significant progress in recent years, but as The Huffington Post reported in March, funds for the CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention Program have been cut by 93 percent -- down to $2 million this year from $29.2 million last year. The money is primarily funneled to state health departments for childhood screening, education programs and data collection. Another large chunk of money for lead poisoning prevention comes from HUD, but its support for cities, counties and states to get lead hazards out of homes has also decreased in recent years. Further, HUD-supported work often relies on data from CDC programs.In Wednesday's response to the advisory committee, the CDC expressed its concern about the dearth of resources in the face of an inflated case load. \"These reductions limit CDC's ability to fully implement many of these recommendations in the short term,\" the statement said.The consequences go beyond children. In 2008, lead poisoning cost society an estimated $50.9 billion. And according to the U.S. Economic Policy institute, each dollar invested in lead paint hazard control results in a return of $17 to $221.Rebecca Morley, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, pointed to ominous new studies on academic achievement. She said third-grade test scores, which are highly correlated with high-school drop out rates, were significantly lower among children exposed to lead -- even at blood levels as low as 3 or 4 micrograms per deciliter.\"We're really putting ourselves at a disadvantage nationally in terms of education and crime,\" Morley said.\"The brains of today's children are the security of the nation a generation from now,\" Landrigan added. \"There are high stakes here.\""}, {"title": "Sea Turtle Conservation Boosted by New Research", "text": "Scientists have uncovered new details about sea turtle migrations in what could potentially be a breakthrough in the conservation of these endangered animals.The study, published in The Journal of Experimental Biology, found that young loggerhead sea turtles use a \"smart swimming\" strategy to navigate the ocean waters as tiny hatchlings. By swimming only when they are in danger, and drifting at all other times, the baby sea turtles are able to conserve energy and migrate long distances, the researchers found.The study used computer-based simulations that combined ocean currents and \"virtual turtles\" swimming for various period of time. The long-standing belief had been that sea turtle migration is based solely on ocean currents, but this study disproved that theory.\"Most researchers have assumed that, because ocean currents in some places move faster than young turtles can swim, the turtles cannot control their migratory paths,\" explains Kenneth J. Lohmann, a marine biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"This study shows otherwise.\"So what, then, guides the defenseless sea turtles on their epic journeys? Another recent study suggests that Earth's magnetic field, acting almost as \"road signs,\" plays a large role in helping the animals \"steer\" through the ocean.The paper, published in the Current Opinion in Neurobiology, summarizes a decade of research on sea turtle migrations and found that the animals are hard-wired from birth to migrate as an evolutionary response to escaping predators.The findings have broader implications for the conservation of sea turtles, the authors say.For instance, one common conservation method is to use wire cages to protect sea turtle eggs from predators like raccoons. However, these cages could interfere with the magnetic fields that sea turtles use for migration, the study found.In addition, if one population of sea turtles were to become extinct, relocating other populations to different areas probably would be unsuccessful, because those sea turtles would be unfamiliar with the new location, making them unable to navigate the area.Those conservation efforts are critical to the animals' survival. All sea turtles are listed as either threatened or endangered. In fact, only about one out of every 4,000 hatchlings in Florida survives into adulthood."}, {"title": "Solar-Powered Implants Could Help The Blind", "text": "For anyone who needed further evidence for the benefits of solar power: A new device being developed at Stanford University relies on solar-powered implants to help the blind, turning light signals into nerve impulses with special glasses that fire infrared signals onto an array of silicon photodiodes set in the eye.\"It works like the solar panels on your roof, converting light into electric current,\" Dr. Daniel Palanker, associate professor of ophthalmology, told GizMag. \"But instead of the current flowing to your refrigerator, it flows into your retina.\"While early models of implants relied on a bulky external power source, the system spearheaded by James Loudin and his colleagues at Stanford University simplifies the process by transmitting visual data to the implants directly.

But Sean Tufts is not your typical retired football player. Nor is he your classic promoter of wind energy as the nation\u2019s primary source of renewable energy.It\u2019s what sets the 30-year-old Colorado native apart from others in both arenas.\u201cI\u2019m able to use football to tell my story to customers and sell myself as unique,\u201d says Tufts, who played on the Carolina Panthers from 2004 to 2006.What\u2019s he selling? As development manager of RES Americas, he helps pitch utilities on the potential of harnessing the wind\u2019s energy to provide electricity to consumers, he says. \u201cIt helps with sales. It\u2019s a way to be remembered.\u201dBefore joining RES Americas two years ago, he co-owned a company that convinced landowners to allow wind farms on their land.While capitalizing on the skills he learned as a football player \u2014 traits that include tenacity, drive and teambuilding \u2014 he\u2019s keen to the skepticism others have when dealing with former professional athletes.\u201cI get asked a lot if I\u2019m an engineer,\u201d Tufts says. He went on to say that he believes the energy field covers \u201ctwo defenses,\u201d the land field and the science field. He\u2019s set his sights on the former.\u201cI am working with a team. They are the experts in perfecting wind farms.\u201d Tufts serves as project manager for the company\u2019s wind farms in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. He organizes and oversees a small team who handle engineering, permitting, financing and transmission issues.It\u2019s a position of respect he\u2019s earned from having returned to his old alma mater, the University of Colorado, for his MBA in renewable energy and finance.When knee injuries forced him from the Carolina Panthers and into the workforce in 2006, he quickly realized he was being sized up by potential employers, Tufts recalls. He understands the stereotype of former NFLers who use their football career as a crutch instead of a lever, he says.\u201cA further education would put that to bed,\u201d he says.And it has.Ty Ferretti, licensing executive for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, didn\u2019t even know Tufts had been a football player when the two were pursuing their MBAs in energy. Now he networks with Tufts, seeking advice on common energy matters and keeping each other abreast of industry trends and activities.\u201cHe has the uncanny ability to organize a group of people and get them into one line of thinking,\u201d Ferretti says. \u201cHe is part of the deals that get wind turbines in the ground. He uses his leadership and personality to get everyone to come to an agreement and moving in the right direction.\u201dFor someone who was such a celebrity, \u201ca local legend, Cherry Creek born and raised,\u201d Tufts actually comes off as rather humble, Ferretti adds.\u201cHe\u2019s so likeable. You don\u2019t see a fierce linebacker ready to sack the quarterback. He\u2019s a very fun and happy and confident man, a charismatic leader. And people want to work with him.\u201dStill, it\u2019s hard to mistake the intensity he brings from his former life into the workplace, Ferretti says. \u201cSean believes in the cause. It\u2019s why he got into it. He\u2019s able to use the discipline and internal motivation that is required to be a professional football player in a new industry that is desperate for someone who understands the industry and can get deals done.\u201dTufts feels the same way. \u201cMy position is unique because my competitive background and desire and understanding help my company succeed.\u201dSince 1997, RES Americas, based in the Denver area, says it has developed and constructed about 10 percent of the installed capacity of wind energy in the country. In 2001, it co-developed and built what was the largest wind project in the world at that time, according to the company\u2019s website.More recently it has branched into solar and other renewable systems such as energy storage.RES Americas\u2019 solar project outside of Austin, Texas, is one of the largest in the country, the company states on its web page. Tufts is involved in a few of the company\u2019s solar projects, but primarily focuses on wind energy.While the jump from athletics to energy may seem drastic, Tufts says it stems from an interest in community action and an appreciation of nature.\u201cWhen I left the NFL grand stage that I enjoyed, I felt my next career should be a bigger calling,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying football, I had ample opportunity to volunteer in the community. Those included visits to the local hospital and reading to school children. They [fans] paid $75 to $100 to see you play, the least you can do is pay it forward.\u201dGrowing up in the west, Tufts says protecting natural resources seemed embedded in the culture. Locals were expected to pick up after themselves, whether in downtown Denver or Rocky Mountain National Park, he says.With a father on ski patrol, Tufts recalls his mountain adventures, which involved hiking, biking, fishing, hunting and cross-country skiing. \u201cSometimes we were prepared; sometimes we were unprepared. They say business is conducted on the golf course. In Boulder, business is done on the hiking trail.\u201dTufts says his father-in-law opened the door to an energy career. He had sold a home to a founder of a wind business. At the time Tufts had just retired from football and was looking for a job. He had considered becoming a paramedic, but he knew his knee injury would hold him back.\u201cI found a position doing front end work in wind farms,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had a quality of being bigger than me that I really enjoyed.\u201dBesides that, the economy was falling apart at that time while renewable energy was the only business that was thriving, he says. In the energy field, \u201cI could support my family better, and my community.\u201dThrough his current work, Tufts believes he can have a larger influence than he did in football, he says.\u201cFootball is entertainment. The show is a break from reality.\u201d In some ways, the position he holds now fits into the global game plan for solving the world\u2019s energy crisis. Or as Tufts puts it: leaving his place better than he found it."}, {"title": "Why Did O'Malley Cross the Road? Because Big Chicken Told Him To", "text": "Just last week, Food and Water Watch broke a story about extremely close ties between Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and the poultry company Perdue. O'Malley's closeness to Perdue was evidenced in 70 pages of emails acquired under a state freedom of information request; they are largely between O'Malley and Perdue's general counsel, Herb Frerichs. As revealing as the emails are, subsequent disclosures indicate that the relationship may be even more of a tangled web than was originally thought.Maryland is home to the Perdue chicken empire, a multibillion-dollar industry that has managed to game the system to avoid responsibility for its waste in a way that few companies have achieved. Proper disposal of the hundreds of thousands of tons of manure from its very profitable enterprise is critical, given that agriculture, including Perdue's chicken farms, remains the largest source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay and many other waterways across the country.Two years ago a lawsuit was filed against a Perdue farm for Clean Water Act violations in a case that, for the first time, sought to hold the poultry giant responsible for the wastes from its production system. The case has caused a firestorm of controversy and media attention and a full-fledged PR press by a company desperate to hold onto its polluting ways. They've even deployed their friend, the governor, to publically denounce the legal merits of the claim and bully the law school clinic that is acting as co-counsel in the case. The case is presently scheduled to go to trial in October of this year.The governor claimed his public admonition to the clinic was motivated by his concern for the contract grower who was also named as a co-defendant in the case, but the emails between O'Malley and Perdue's lawyer, who is also a partner in the law firm that is representing the company in the CWA claim, indicate a very different reason. The emails suggest that O'Malley really doesn't really care about contract growers -- his real interest in making his inappropriate public stance against the suit is in protecting his friends at Perdue.Privately, the poultry contract growers will tell you that there's simply no way for them to responsibly manage all the waste left behind by Perdue's chickens. Many will tell you that CWA co-permitting -- making the integrators such as Perdue equally liable for their highly-polluting waste -- would be one of the biggest benefits to overburdened contract growers. Yet in one draft email O'Malley writes to Jim Perdue, he promises the industry CEO that he will never pursue co-permitting in his state. So while O'Malley publically stands up for contract growers, in private he's undermining them by pandering to mega-rich integrators and telling Jim Perdue he'll never get in the way of Perdue's irresponsible waste practices.It should not be surprising that O'Malley operates in such an underhanded way. In a recent report card put out by the State Integrity website that tracks corruption risk in the 50 states, Maryland was ranked 40th, receiving an overall grade of D-minus. You might think next year's report card grade will even go lower in light of this recent insider dealing disclosure, but for \"Executive Accountability\" O'Malley and Maryland were already getting an F. The governor just can't go any lower.When faced with such flagrant indiscretions, you always have to ask yourself, \"Why?\" Why would the governor of a state like Maryland engage in such shameless pandering? It's certainly not economic importance. The agriculture industry in Maryland makes up only a tiny percentage (0.35 percent) of the state's GDP and Perdue and its poultry operations make up only a very small part of that already-minuscule percentage. Sure, there's some money involved; in 2010 Perdue switched its funding from the Republican Governor's Association to the Democratic Governor's Association. That was the same year that O'Malley just happened to become Chair of the Association. And, of course, O'Malley's brother was just recently handed a job at the law firm where Frerichs is a partner. But one would hope that those kinds of offerings aren't enough to sway a chief executive of a state, so perhaps the answer lies elsewhere.In a Grist piece from last week, the author stated that O'Malley is acting like he's the  \"Governor of the State of Perdue\" instead of the state of Maryland. There's no denying that fact, but while O'Malley is trying to juggle Maryland and Perdue, he also has a third state on his mind: Iowa.Unlike O'Malley's home state, Iowa's is largely ag-dependant, with the industry accounting for about 25 percent of state's economy. Iowa, as the first presidential caucus state in every election, also happens to be the initial stop on the road to the White House, a road that O'Malley has indicated he has every intention of traveling down come 2016. For O'Malley, pandering to big ag means paving the way for Iowa.O'Malley is looking to go to Iowa and claim he's a friend of the farmer. He was hoping to hold high in one hand his public condemnation of the Perdue law suit to say he supports the \"family farm\" while keeping his backroom \"no co-permitting\" email assurances to the integrators tightly clenched in the other hand behind his back. If he didn't get caught in his hypocrisy and pandering, it would have been a win-win. But now that the truth is out, there is hopefully no Iowa for O'Malley. We've had enough of influence peddling and duplicity in our governmental leaders; we don't need more."}, {"title": "5 Videos Of Cats That Love Water", "text": "It's widely accepted that cats don't like water, but these swimming, splashing and bathing felines prove to be the exceptions to the rule.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Countering Wind Energy Skepticism", "text": "The Wall Street Journal's tepid stance on renewable wind energy is receiving some push back from people who actually experience the benefits of this abundant and promising resource. On Monday, Iowa Governor Terry E. Branstad had a letter published in the Wall Street Journal contesting two recent Journal editorials lambasting the wind-energy Production Tax Credit and renewable portfolio standard.Gov. Branstad wrote, \"Our state is receiving 20% of its electricity from wind farms at stable and dependable rates, and there are over 215 wind-related businesses operating in 55 counties across Iowa, providing jobs for more than 5,000 workers.\"The conservative Journal had written that states like Minnesota have seen increased electricity rates due to their renewable energy standards. Yet there are questions about the studies that see increases in electricity rates. One group of researchers skeptical of the recent alarmism found that many states saw the rise in electricity rates before the implementation of renewable energy standards slow down, if not reverse. While Gov. Branstad, a Republican, did not directly question the Journal's assertions on electricity rates, his dissent was certainly impactful. Disseminating well-supported opposing information that counters the stand-pat positions of outposts reluctant to embrace clean energy is vital to secure a future with a livable environment and progressive energy policy. Doing so within the pages of the staid Wall Street Journal is doubly impressive.The Production Tax Credit exists to reduce costs for wind-generated electricity by reducing companies' tax bills by 2.2 cents per kWh. The PTC is good for the first 10 years of a wind company's life. As Greg Pfahl, an audit partner at the Denver office of Hein & Associates LLP, explains, \"It's a credit off of the tax due at the end of the year. There is no grant or anything such as that like the Investment Tax Credit.\" Yet its own life is in jeopardy due to partisan gridlock. Its extension is being debated in Congress, and if it ends in January as scheduled, it could result in the loss of up to 37,000 jobs. Renewable portfolio standards, on the other hand, are government-issued orders that utilities draw a certain percentage of their energy from renewable sources and have been popular from California to Germany.This isn't the first Wall Street Journal editorial to dismiss wind energy potential. In the past, the paper has questioned whether tools like the Production Tax Credit were cost effective, yet their lack of expertise in the area jumped out. The paper claimed the tax credit was 2.2% for every kilowatt, as opposed to 2.2 cents.Of course, we can't all be experts in wind energy, and even popular proponents of renewable energy can drop the ball when presented with seemingly compelling arguments against wind energy, as notable progressive Roger Ebert seemed to do in his review of the movie Windfall. (Here is a wind expert's take on the movie.)This makes it important for those armed with the facts and the experience of working with wind energy, such as Gov. Branstad, to speak up. And it only improves the quality of the information Wall Street Journal readers and other skeptics receive when informed green energy proponents do so."}, {"title": "Sustainable Earth: Oceans", "text": "\"If I were speaking to all the leaders at Rio+20 I'd say this is not [a choice between] the ocean or ourselves,\" said marine ecologist Enric Sala, a National Geographic explorer-in-residence. \"A healthy ocean means healthier humans, more food on our tables, more jobs, and a healthier economy.\"Read more on National Geographic"}, {"title": "Australia's Koalas: Threatened By Urban Sprawl, The Marsupial Struggles To Survive (PHOTOS)", "text": "From Susan Kelly for National Geographic:Koalas going\u2026going\u2026One of the world\u2019s most adored animals is now officially in peril on our rapidly changing, human-oriented planet.What\u2019s causing their demise? No great surprise.Us.As their forests fall to development in their native Australia, koalas find themselves having to survive alongside people in urban sprawl, where they get into all kinds of trouble. Dogs, cars, swimming pools and many other things that are a part of modern human life can be deadly to these tree-dwelling marsupials.But now it\u2019s hoped the sharp decline of Australia\u2019s national symbol may be averted, following a historic decision by the Federal Government to list the koala as Vulnerable under the country\u2019s national threatened species legislation. The ruling means the Federal Government could impose conditions on plans for new mines, housing developments and timber operations to prevent habitat disturbance, though it will not affect existing developments in koala areas.Official reports cite habitat destruction paired with disease and climate change as the greatest immediate threats to the species. \u201cIn places like New South Wales and Queensland, their numbers have been taking a massive hit,\u201d Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke said. (Read Minister Burke\u2019s media statement.) [Text continues after slideshow]Photos and captions courtesy of National Geographic and Susan KellyIt\u2019s a welcome political awakening. Koalas have been under immense pressure for some time from urban or industrial expansion into wild areas, and Australia\u2019s new listing of koalas lags well behind other countries. The U.S. Government listed koalas as Threatened in the year 2000, when it determined that the Eucalyptus forest on which this unique animal depends had been greatly reduced from land-clearing.\u201cDespite several conservation actions by the Government of Australia, the limited koala habitat continues to deteriorate. The species also is threatened by fragmentation of the habitat that remains, disease, loss of genetic variation, and death by dogs and motor vehicles due to development,\u201d the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service noted in the U.S. Federal Register in May 2000.More recently in 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the koala as one of the ten species in the world most vulnerable to climate change. Global warming has been linked to increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere which \u201creduce the nutritional quality of Eucalyptus leaves, causing nutrient shortages in the species that forage on them. As a result, koalas may no longer be able to meet their nutritional demands, resulting in malnutrition and starvation.\u201dDespite clear evidence of significant losses and international concern for the adorable icon, not all koala populations will be classified as Vulnerable by Australia\u2019s Federal Government. The legislation will only apply to the most at-risk populations on the east coast of the country \u2013 in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. At the state level, \u201ckoalas are already listed as Vulnerable in New South Wales and have been for some time, and it hasn\u2019t helped them greatly. But it\u2019s well and truly better that they are put on a listing rather than not,\u201d said Cheyne Flanagan, Supervisor of the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, which has been in operation for almost 40 years. It\u2019s the world\u2019s first hospital dedicated to wild koala rescue, care and rehabilitation and funded entirely by donations. (Watch the video clip of an orphan baby koala being treated for injuries at the Koala Hospital.)Wildlife has been collateral damage in the drive for economic growth and Environment Minister Burke recounted widespread and severe declines. The \u201cKoala Coast\u201d in Queensland, a former stronghold for koalas, is one of the most glaring examples of national negligence, where numbers plummeted from around 6,000 to 2,000 in the past decade. (Read more about this in the National Geographic article Koala Rescue.)Even so, the prescription for koala protection in this region is disagreeable to Queensland state leader Campbell Newman, who claims it is \u201cmindless green tape\u201d and is concerned \u201cthis could interfere with the construction sector.\u201dPolitical posturing ensued between state and federal governments following Newman\u2019s critical comments, with Burke calling the Queensland leader an environmental vandal. \u201cThe science is overwhelming that the Queensland koala has taken a massive hit over the last 20 years,\u201d Burke said. \u201cCampbell Newman may be happy for Queensland to be a place where koalas only live in zoos, but I am not.\u201dPublic reaction to the debate in the media ranges from \u201cWhy does it have to be environment or development? Does he not see that good planning can achieve for both? Do we have to cover the whole state in houses or mine pits?\u201d \u2013 to \u2013 \u201cIt will drain millions from all people wishing to improve or subdivide their properties and add further cost to all land purchases for residential use.\u201dBurke\u2019s announcement has received a positive if somewhat mixed reaction overall. It is good news that the koala has been listed under Commonwealth legislation, according to Central Queensland University koala ecologist Alistair Melzer. \u201cHowever, it is hardly a cause for celebration.\u201dSome sectors of the community remain unconvinced the current designation is suitable, with advocates expressing views that koalas should be covered countrywide. But the majority of koala lovers, scientists and campaigners greet the listing with enthusiasm, heralding it as progress by the current Gillard Government and a refreshing reprieve from criticisms that government typically puts industry ahead of conservation.For this writer, it\u2019s mystifying how the furry icon could be in such dire straits in the first place, in a lightly populated, wealthy and educated country like Australia. With population pressures and poverty prevailing in most of the rest of the world, wildlife decline is understandable, although still unacceptable. Without these same pressures, it appears Australia\u2019s mismanagement of its natural heritage is purely for shortsighted economic gain.Economic imperatives have driven koalas to the edge of existence. Twice. This is the second time in modern history they needed to be rescued from the brink. Where they were once exploited for the fur trade, they are now being annihilated by habitat loss and its secondary effects, like the stress-related chlamydial disease that threaten them.Cheyne Flanagan of the Koala Hospital reports chlamydia is one of the most serious issues. \u201cThis is a disease that tends to occur in disturbed habitats, it doesn\u2019t happen in populations that are healthy and in the bush \u2026 Without a doubt, all wildlife issues in this country, whether it\u2019s koalas or whatever, it\u2019s all tied into habitat issues. That\u2019s it, bottom line.\u201dOther obstacles to their continued existence include environmental policy lag and legal loopholes. Policy protections are not keeping pace with environmental destruction, while those that are in place are ineffective, underfunded or prone to loopholes in the law that can be used to navigate around them.The wheels of bureaucracy turn slowly in the curious case of the koala. The 1998 National Koala Conservation Strategy has been in place for 15 years, outlining all of the issues detailed in this article and more. But instead of alleviating the koala\u2019s troubles, the population has crashed.If they\u2019re to be at all useful, the new listing and the old National Koala Strategy will need to be subject to scrutiny, regulation and provide tangible benefits for koala conservation.However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results \u2013 Winston Churchill\u201cThe listing alone will not save the koala,\u201d relates Melzer. \u201dIt\u2019s basically a label that says we\u2019ve got to a point where koalas are in serious trouble and need careful management if they\u2019re going to survive.\u201d He called for a koala report card to follow the progress of populations and their habitat over time.However disheartening its current circumstance, solving the koala\u2019s dilemma is not that complex. According to Melzer, \u201ckoalas are the easiest animals in the world to conserve, you just have to account for them.\u201dKoalas 101 From the National Geographic Website Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus):Though often called the koala \u201cbear,\u201d this cuddly animal is not a bear at all; it is a marsupial, or pouched mammal. After giving birth, a female koala carries her baby in her pouch for about six months. When the infant emerges, it rides on its mother\u2019s back or clings to her belly, accompanying her everywhere until it is about a year old.Koalas live in eastern Australia, where the eucalyptus trees they love are most plentiful. In fact, they rarely leave these trees, and their sharp claws and opposable digits easily keep them aloft. During the day they doze, tucked into forks or nooks in the trees, sleeping for up to 18 hours.When not asleep a koala feeds on eucalyptus leaves, especially at night. Unless there\u2019s drought conditions or heat waves, koalas do not drink much water as they get most of their moisture from these leaves. Each animal eats a tremendous amount for its size\u2014about two and a half pounds (one kilogram) of leaves a day. Koalas even store snacks of leaves in pouches in their cheeks.A special digestive system\u2014a long gut\u2014allows koalas to break down the tough eucalyptus leaves and remain unharmed by their poison. Koalas eat so many of these leaves that they take on a distinctive odor from their oil, reminiscent of cough drops.These plump, fuzzy mammals were widely hunted during the 1920s and 1930s, and their populations plunged. Helped by reintroduction, they have reappeared over much of their former range, but their populations are smaller and scattered. Koalas need a lot of space\u2014about a hundred trees per animal\u2014a pressing problem as Australia\u2019s woodlands continue to shrink."}, {"title": "The Bottom Line: Even Fish Need Yearly Checkups", "text": "Health care is a controversial topic these days, but one thing we can all agree on is the importance of annual checkups. Every year, millions of Americans visit their doctors as a proactive measure to stay healthy, identify any underlying conditions, and check for common problems -- all in an effort to promote long-term health. What makes sense for us is equally important for life in our oceans. Each year, U.S. ocean fish populations undergo a checkup by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in a report to Congress, the Status of U.S. Fisheries.On May 14, 2012, NOAA released its 2011 checkup, and I am pleased to share some good news. Last year, thanks to our system of science-based management, six U.S. ocean fish stocks were fully rebuilt to healthy levels, others continued their recovery, and significant progress was made in ending overfishing. These conservation gains occurred in nearly every region of the country.Our nation's fish populations are becoming healthier because of the conservation mandates of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Management and Conservation Act (MSA), which require science-based catch limits that do not allow overfishing. Overall, 27 U.S. ocean fish populations have been rebuilt to healthy levels since 2000.I want to take a moment to acknowledge that these conservation achievements were possible because of the hard work, ingenuity, and often short-term sacrifices of U.S. fishermen, combined with more effective management by the regional fishery management councils and NOAA. On this occasion, it's important to thank them for all they are doing for us and for future generations.Healthy ocean fish populations benefit the U.S. economy, providing jobs, income, and seafood for tens of millions of Americans. For example, the mid-Atlantic summer flounder population, declared fully rebuilt in 2011, supports thousands of jobs and brings in millions of dollars a year. Anglers from New York to Maryland are enjoying the growing abundance of this once-depleted fish.Any doctor would point out that this year's report wasn't a clean bill of health: Thirty six of America's most commercially and recreationally important ocean fish populations are still subject to overfishing, and 45 have been depleted to unhealthy levels.But we are on the right track. Sanctioned overfishing is coming to an end this year, and if U.S. fishery managers continue to follow good scientific advice and adhere to the MSA's conservation requirements, I expect we will continue to see significant progress. And perhaps my New Year's resolution -- to help America's ocean fish gain weight -- will also be realized."}, {"title": "Nuclear Safety Debate Between Industry, Regulators Focuses On Radiation Filters", "text": "In a letter sent Tuesday to Gregory B. Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, representatives of the nuclear power industry argued that an enhanced safety feature designed to limit releases of radioactive gases into the environment during a severe accident was being hastily considered by the commission.Nuclear safety advocates, however, argue that the industry is simply jockeying to avoid added costs as the commission begins to implement tougher safety guidelines for U.S. reactors in the aftermath of last year's meltdown at a Japanese power plant.The safety feature in question -- a filter that would remove harmful radioactivity from gases being intentionally vented into the air during an emergency -- is being weighed as part of a host of new requirements for reactors in the United States. The new guidelines, formulated in response to the tsunami-driven nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan last year, are aimed at shoring up a variety of safety measures at U.S. plants, including those of similar pedigree to the ones used at Fukushima.Among the new guidelines is one that requires installation of vents in containment buildings at 31 boiling water reactors or, where they already exist, improvements to ensure their safe operation. Should all other cooling systems fail during an accident, such vents would allow operators to relieve pressure inside a reactor building by exhaling gases into the environment, thereby preventing an explosion and perhaps a far more dangerous dispersal of radioactivity.Nuclear safety advocates have argued that installing filters on the vents -- a technology already in wide use in Europe and that is now required in Japan -- makes simple sense, because it would not only save the reactor but prevent contamination of the surrounding area. An unfiltered release could conceivably contaminate substantial swaths of land around a hobbled reactor, forcing residents and business owners to abandon an area for decades.The NRC has so far only required the vents, though it has ordered its staff, which is developing guidelines for implementing the vent requirement, to also weigh the possibility of requiring filters.In the letter to Jaczko, however, Anthony R. Pietrangelo, the senior vice president and chief nuclear officer with the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobby group, argued that the filters should be considered separately from the vent guidelines and weighed against other means already available to control potential radioactive releases during an emergency. Among these, Pietrangelo said, are \"containment sprays, flooding, venting, alternate containment heat removal, and enhanced operator actions.\"In an email message, Steven Kerekes, a spokesman for NEI, elaborated on these techniques, describing them as \"methods that keep or inject water into the bottom of the containment structure, that remove heat and gases from containment, and that incorporate rehearsed or trained actions by reactor operators.\"Pietrangelo also said that the best way to protect people and the environment from radioactive exposures is to prevent damage to the fuel in the first place, and that the industry deploys multiple, redundant systems to do just that. \"To begin the examination of enhanced mitigation strategies with a recommendation and decision on vent filters ignores these principles and the tenets of risk-informed regulation.\"Nuclear safety advocates, however, argue that the industry is simply attempting to avoid added costs. \"The American public should not be treated like second-class citizens by the nuclear industry and should be afforded the same level of protection provided in Europe since the late 1980s,\" said Jim Riccio, lead nuclear analyst with the environmental group Greenpeace. \"Japan just ordered filtered vents for all their nuclear reactors and even the Romanians have followed suit,\" he said. \"But I am still concerned that the captured commission will once again buckle and fold and side with NEI.\"Two stakeholder meetings on the filter issue were held this month, and NRC staff will use that input to issue a recommendation in July.A spokesman for Jaczko, Eliot Brenner, said in an email that \"the staff continues to work on a paper to the commission on the subject, so it remains under examination.\"This article has been updated to include a statement from the NEI."}, {"title": "Imperiling People, Posterity, and the Planet", "text": "Worried about the fate of the Euro? The student loan crisis? Unemployment? The federal deficit? Here's something we can all worry about: The latest Living Planet Report, published by the Global Footprint Network and the World Wildlife Fund, indicates that humanity is now consuming resources at a pace that is 52 percent faster than what the Earth can renew. And that doesn't take into account the rate at which we are depleting non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, and metals.Consumed, as most of us are, by our personal finances and challenges, we fail to take note that humanity is now over-consuming resources and imperiling -- in the process -- people, posterity and the planet. That's understandable. When you are up to your eyeballs in work or debt, it's hard to see the big picture.But we ignore the big picture at our peril.Three thousand scientists and experts meeting in London earlier this year issued a declaration warning of \"catastrophic consequences\" for human civilization unless we take steps to reduce the over-consumption of Earth's resources. England's prestigious Royal Society subsequently released a report on \"People and the Planet,\" which reached a similar conclusion. Sir John Sulston, the Nobel Prize laureate who led the team of scientists working on the report, warned of a possible \"downward vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills.\"These warnings are not new. John Beddington, the U.K.'s chief science adviser, three years ago gave a speech in which he warned that population growth, climate change, and the world's rising demand for food, energy, and water constituted a \"perfect storm\" that could destabilize the world by 2030, or sooner.Last year, Jeremy Grantham, a top financial analyst and the co-founder of GMO, one of the world's largest investment management funds, wrote a newsletter in which he warned that we have entered an era of resource scarcity that will precipitate periodic shortages and cause commodity prices for food, minerals, and metals to trend ever higher in the long term.Most of us are oblivious to humanity's impact on the world, and that is particularly true with respect to our impact on other living creatures. This week's Living Planet report indicates that since the 1970's there's been a 30 percent loss in biodiversity on average, and that the loss in tropical species is twice as high. Wetlands, forests, reefs, and savannahs are all falling victim to human encroachment.But as world population grows and consumption levels expand, it will get harder to ignore humanity's impact on planetary resources. The excessive demands that we are putting on the planet will inevitably lead to acute water shortages, a chronic food crisis, and rising prices for energy, metals, and minerals. Indeed, it's already happening. In the last five years, we already endured two global food crises, and we're just another bout of severe weather away from a third one. And soon, if not already, rising prices for fuel, minerals and metals will begin to act as a break on the world's economic accelerator. High oil prices almost certainly contributed to the severity of the Great Recession, and they have, in all likelihood, slowed the pace of recovery.Challenges abound. In the next few decades, severe water scarcity in the Middle East and some parts of Asia could lead to humanitarian crises and chronic hardship, and set back our efforts to eradicate hunger and severe poverty. And then there's the impact of climate change. A growing number of scientists believe that the increased incidence of drought and flooding that we are seeing is attributable to the accumulating levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. If so, the worst is yet to come.According to the Living Planet report, humanity has been in ecological \"overshoot\" for over three decades. The human trajectory of expanding population and rising consumption is, by almost any measure, unsustainable.No one should diminish the importance of what happens to the Euro, the student loan crisis, or our current economic malaise, but long after these problems are solved we will still be wrestling with the challenges posed by an overcrowded, over-exploited, over-heated, over-consuming world. Those challenges are not insurmountable. Not yet. There are many relatively inexpensive steps that can be taken to reduce carbon emissions, preserve biodiversity, conserve water, boost food production, and prevent unwanted pregnancies. Time, however, is running short, our options are narrowing, and the cost of delay is rising."}, {"title": "Our Most Endangered River? In the Shadow of the Capital", "text": "I was awoken today by the sound of raindrops on my windowsill. Sitting down at my desk, with the peaceful patter of water helping me to collect my thoughts and prepare for the day, I was stunned to read a report that enumerates a truth I already knew all too well.Tuesday, American Rivers released its annual America's Most Endangered Rivers report. On the list, there are rivers under threat from natural gas development, the construction of new dams and reservoirs, mountaintop removal for coal mining, and excessive water withdrawals. Looking over these threats, it is clear that what is fundamentally at risk is the quality and quantity of our freshwater -- water that we can swim in, drink, and fish from... water that is there when and where we need it.And at the top of the list this year is a river that continues to be in serious danger from pollution -- a threat that is only heightened as members of Congress zealously crusade to dismantle and rollback key provisions of the Clean Water Act, the single most important piece of environmental legislation designed to protect our freshwater. The Potomac River, which flows through our nation's capital from the storied depths of our country's past, is number 1 on the list of America's Most Endangered Rivers of 2012.In some ways, I am not surprised. In 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson called the Potomac \"a national disgrace\" because the river was a cesspool of sewage and industrial chemicals. Yet, despite how disheartening this observation may have been, it served as a much-needed wake-up call for our country. In fact, his remark was a major catalyst -- among other observations like it concerning rivers across the United States -- for the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972. And with the passage of this groundbreaking legislation, we witnessed an unprecedented resurgence of the Potomac and rivers across the country over the last few decades.But the fight to restore our rivers clearly wasn't over. In 2010, rounding out our 17,100 mile journey across North America, I brought my Blue Legacy crew to the Potomac River to reconnect with the watershed many of us call home. Yet, the message we took back from our final expedition stop was not one of hope and optimism -- but rather, a message of uncertainty and ongoing threat.While advancements have been made to partially restore its health and preserve the integrity of its rich natural habitat, the Potomac River is still threatened on a number of fronts. In our film, \"Our Nation's River: A System on the Edge,\" we investigate the ongoing challenges the river faces, with experts including: Potomac Riverkeeper, Ed Merrifield; Sandra Postel, founder of the Global Water Policy Project and National Geographic Freshwater Fellow; Chuck Fox, from the EPA; and The Nature Conservancy's Stephanie Flack. From these interviews, it is clear that the river and its tributaries -- and the people and communities that depend on them -- are still in jeopardy, because, today, the Potomac River barely sits on the edge of recovery.Our Nation's River: A System on the Edge from Alexandra Cousteau on Vimeo.The worst part about the situation is that, in spite of what scientists and water conservationists are telling us about the delicate state of the Potomac, Congress is actively pursuing legislation that will reduce federal environmental oversight of our lakes, rivers, and streams. Outside magazine reported on some specific bills that are meant to undermine the Clean Water Act that has protected our waters for so long:So, what is there left to do? Should we throw-up our hands in the air in defeat, and let the devastation to our \"nation's river\" continue unabated -- not to mention the hundreds of lakes, rivers, and tributaries across the country which are still under threat? I am writing today to emphatically say NO! We all have a voice, and together we can make a positive difference.Help protect America's most endangered river and rivers nationwide -- tell your local government official why you care about the Potomac River, and why it is so important that the Clean Water Act is protected. But why stop there? Rivers across America need our support. All of the rivers on this list -- and the hundreds that did not make it this year -- represent a front line in the struggle against environmental de-regulation. Make no mistake, this water belongs to the people and the communities we live in, and we will not give up our right to protect our water without a fight. We need strong federal oversight to make sure these laws are followed.Listening to the sound of raindrops outside my window, I am reminded of a simple, yet powerful truth. Each one of those drops has begun an incredible journey. Sliding off a leaf, it lands in a puddle on the street, and flows into the storm drain. And at the end of the pipe, it will become one with the Potomac River and eventually, as it re-enters the water cycle once again, part of each one of us. The waters of our rivers course through our veins. So, for the sake of our health, and the health of our children, it's time we did something to stop the degradation of our rivers -- of the Potomac -- because we never want to see our nation's river -- or any of the rivers that run through our communities -- on the most endangered list ever again."}, {"title": "Growing Green Awards: Winners Produce Food that Nourishes People and the Planet", "text": "Today, NRDC announces the winners of the 2012 Growing Green Awards. These awards celebrate the farmers, business owners, and bold thinkers who are transforming America's food system. Each one of them has pioneered ways to produce food that nourishes our families and restores our water, air, and soil at the same time.These leaders stand at the forefront of a movement that is sweeping the nation. This is the fourth year NRDC has hosted the Growing Green Awards and within that short time, there's been an explosion of interest in healthy, sustainable food.It's no surprise people are looking for safer food. In the past year alone, we have had to deal with listeria in cantaloupe, oil in Gulf seafood, fungicide in orange juice, and pink slime in meat.When we go to the store, we bring home more than food -- we bring home traces of broader environmental problems. But we can use our shopping carts and dinner plates to help solve some of those problems. We can choose food that doesn't lead to illnesses like diabetes and cancer. We can choose food that doesn't contribute to water pollution and climate change. And we can choose food that keeps local economies vibrant and farmers on their land.Every year, these healthier, sustainable options are becoming more readily available. Grocery stores, school cafeterias, hospital dining services, and even some fast-food chains are starting to provide them. I find this shift very inspiring. It shows that Americans realize if we change the way we eat, we can change the way the food system works.The winners of the Growing Green Awards are pointing the way forward.Gabe Brown, a rancher from North Dakota and the winner of the Food Producer Award, has devised innovative grazing techniques that not only sustain a vibrant herd of sustainably raised cattle, but also replenish the health of his soil and provide habitat for wildlife.  A few years ago, Andrea Northup -- the winner of the Young Food Leader Award -- was a recent college graduate sleeping on her friend's couch wondering how to translate her concern about failing school lunch programs into action. Still in her twenties, she is the architect of model healthy lunch legislation adopted in the District of Columbia and is the founding leader of D.C. Farm to School Network, an organization that brings local, fresh food to 200 schools in the District and educates children about growing and eating healthy food.  The Business Leader Award Winner George Siemon also focuses on bringing sustainable food to more people. As the CEO of Organic Valley for 25 years, he has helped countless farmers embrace organic production methods, and created a cooperative of more than 1,700 organic family farms Together, they have demonstrated that organic farming can go from niche to mainstream, competing successfully in the conventional food system.This year, NRDC added a new prize in the Growing Green Awards: the Food Justice Award. We created this award because we cannot have sustainable food without sustainable labor practices. The people who harvest America's food must be treated with respect and earn a living wage.Yet many of the Latino, Maya Indian, and Haitian migrant farm workers in Florida's tomatoes fields were routinely deprived of workplace protections that most of us take for granted. Then, Lucas Benitez and Greg Asbed co-founded the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and transformed the tomato industry.They knew conditions could improve if major buyers paid just a penny more per pound for tomatoes and guaranteed justice in the fields.

Indiana too, two years ago. What's going on in the Corn Belt?No farmer in their right mind wants to poison pollinators. When I spoke with one Iowa corn farmer in January and told him about the upcoming release of a Purdue study confirming corn as a major pesticide exposure route for bees, his face dropped with worn exasperation. He looked down for a moment, sighed and said, \"You know, I held out for years on buying them GE seeds, but now I can't get conventional seeds anymore. They just don't carry 'em.\"This leaves us with two questions: 1) What do GE seeds have to do with neonicotinoids and bees? and 2) How can an Iowa corn farmer find himself feeling unable to farm without poisoning pollinators? In other words, where did U.S. corn cultivation go wrong?The short answer to both questions starts with a slow motion train wreck that began in the mid-1990s: Corn integrated pest management (IPM) fell apart at the seams. Rather, it was intentionally unraveled by Bayer and Monsanto.Honey bees caught in the cross-fireCorn is far from the only crop treated by neonicotinoids, but it is the largest use of arable land in North America, and honey bees rely on corn as a major protein source. At least 94 percent of the 92 million acres of corn planted across the U.S. this year will have been treated with either clothianidin or thiamethoxam (another neonicotinoid).As we head into peak corn planting season throughout the U.S. Midwest, bees will once again \"get it from all sides\" as they:GE corn & neonicotinoid seed treatments go hand-in-handOver the last 15 years, U.S. corn cultivation has gone from a crop requiring little-to-no insecticides and negligible amounts of fungicides, to a crop where the average acre is grown from seeds treated or genetically engineered to express three different insecticides (as well as a fungicide or two) before being sprayed prophylactically with RoundUp (an herbicide) and a new class of fungicides that farmers didn't know they \"needed\" before the mid-2000s. A series of marketing ploys by the pesticide industry undergird this story. It's about time to start telling it, if for no other reason than to give lie to the oft-repeated notion that there is no alternative to farming corn in a way that poisons pollinators. We were once -- not so long ago -- on a very different path.How corn farming went off the railsIn the early 1990s, we were really good at growing corn using bio-intensive integrated pest management (bio-IPM). In practice, that meant crop rotations, supporting natural predators, using biocontrol agents like ladybugs and as a last resort, using chemical controls only after pests had been scouted for and found. During this time of peak bio-IPM adoption, today's common practice of blanketing corn acreage with \"insurance\" applications of various pesticides without having established the need to do so would have been unthinkable. It's expensive to use inputs you don't need, and was once the mark of bad farming.Then, in the mid-to-late 1990s, GE corn and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) seed treatments both entered the market -- the two go hand-in-hand, partly by design and partly by accident. Conditions for the marketing of both products were ripe due to a combination of factors:Then, as if on cue, Monsanto introduced three different strains of patented, GE corn between 1997 and 2003 (RoundUp Ready, and two Bt-expressing variants aimed at controlling the European Corn Borer and corn root worm). Clothianidin entered the U.S. market under conditional registration in 2003, and in 2004 corn seed companies began marketing seeds treated with a 5X level of neonicotinoids (1.25 mg/seed vs. .25).... and in the space of a decade, U.S. corn acreage undergoes a ten-fold increase in average insecticide use. By 2007, the average acre of corn has more than three systemic insecticides -- both Bt traits and a neonicotinoid. Compare this to the early 1990s, when only an estimated 30-35 percent of all corn acreage were treated with insecticides at all.Adding fuel to the fire, in 2008 USDA's Federal Crop Insurance Board of Directors approved reductions in crop insurance premiums for producers who plant certain Bt corn hybrids. By 2009, 40 percent of corn farmers interviewed said they did not have access to elite (high-yielding) non-Bt corn seed. It is by now common knowledge that conventional corn farmers have a very hard time finding seed that is not genetically engineered and treated with neonicotinoids.Enter fungicidesIn 2007, what's left of corn IPM was further unraveled with the mass marketing of a new class of fungicides (strobilurins) for use on corn as yield \"boosters.\" Before this, fungicide use on corn was so uncommon that it didn't appear in Crop Life's 2002 National Pesticide Use Database. But in the last five years, the pesticide industry has aggressively and successfully marketed prophylactic applications of fungicides on corn as yield and growth enhancers, and use has grown dramatically as a result. This despite the fact that these fungicides work as marketed less than half the time. According to this meta-analysis of efficacy studies, only \"48% of treatments resulted in a yield response greater than the economic break-even value of 6 bu/acre.\"Back to the bees. Neonicotinoids are known to synergize with certain fungicides to increase the toxicity of the former to honey bees up to 1,000-fold, and fungicides may be key culprits in undermining beneficial bee microbiota that do things like make beebread nutritious and support immune response against gut pathogens like Nosema. Fungicide use in corn is likewise destroying beneficial fungi in many cropping systems, and driving the emergence of resistant strains.As with insecticides and herbicides, so too with fungicide use on corn: Corn farmers are stuck on a pesticide treadmill on high gear, with a pre-emptively pressed turbo charge button (as \"insurance\"). Among the many casualties are our honey bees who rely on corn's abundant pollen supply.Keeping us all tethered to the pesticide treadmill is expected behavior from the likes of Monsanto. But what boggles the mind is that all of this is being aided and abetted by a USDA that ties cheap crop insurance to planting patented Bt corn, and a Congress that refuses to tie subsidized crop insurance in the Farm Bill to common-sense conservation practices like bio-intensive IPM. Try explaining that with a waggle dance."}, {"title": "Farewell, Whole New Time", "text": "The grapevine reports that to the springtime beach has come a remarkable castaway: a dead whale. To find it, I just drive into the next town, go to the beach, and look up and down the surf line. About a mile away I see what looks like a black-hulled trawler wrecked on the beach.In the sea such a creature is impressive. But one gets mainly glimpses: the top of a head, a rolling back. Up close, walking alongside its massive contours, it seems surreally revealed, as though here to herald some message, some annunciation, an oracle.This is a fin whale. The world's second-largest animal, fin whales can reach about 90 feet and an estimated 80 tons, and can live up to about a century. This one is about sixty feet long. (The closely related blue whale, reaching a little over 100 feet, is the most massive animal known to have ever lived. Hunted to near-extinction, it's barely hanging on in the Antarctic, recovering strongly in the east Pacific, elsewhere now very rare.)The whale's hulk lies on its port side, marooned past the last high tide line. The waning moon and weakening tides will leave it there quite a while. But I know the people here won't allow this. The nearby homes are too expensive to share the beach with such a wonder. And, the stench will become unpleasant. Full decomposition will likely take us through the summer. Bikinis and decaying blubber -- not the image this place is marketing. Bad for business.So I'm sure the fire department and police will soon intervene; rope off the site; place someone officious to prevent people from doing something stupid to themselves or, maybe worse, the carcass; allow biologists to open a cavernous portal and explore, measure, assess, perhaps reveal; and eventually bury it.But not yet. For now it lies in state with a certain fitting dignity. I circumambulate the corpse freely, unaccosted and unopposed. Under the wide sky and with the backdrop and soundtrack of the immense sea whence it has just come, it is both in and out of its element, natural and unnatural.Its tar-black skin is calico-patched with pink sand-abrasions from the surf-swells that pushed it aground. The huge pleats of its distendable throat, looking like the lapstrake hull of a wooden vessel, run halfway down its body. Its mouth bites a bulldozer's wedge of beach sandwich. In life, this Jonah-gulping throat ballooned like a pelican's pouch, engulfing a swimming pool of water, fishes, and krill. Then its unspeakable tongue would strain water through the mouth-rimming brush of baleen, concentrating entrapped hordes into a satisfying swallow.Living fin whales don't lift their tail flukes above water. Here the tail lies in full view, pitched at a 45-degree angle. Reddened with the bruise of burst blood vessels, these flukes span about twice my body length. The left fluke has furrowed a gouge in the sand like the rudder of a ship run aground. On the landward side, sand has built up against it; on the seaward, the swirl of waves receding has dug a little hollow. The tailstock, run into the sand like a skeg, connects the hull-like body with the massive blades of its propelling tail flukes. That stock seems sturdy as a tree trunk, but the linkage bears the sleekness of motion, attenuating to a wedge above and a wedge below, like a double-edged splitting maul for shattering water as the whale swims. Or swam.The whale's blowhole is slammed shut like a deck hatch. Its left pectoral fin lies embedded in the sand, its right -- about as long as I am tall -- dangles high and dry. The sun is throwing a lifelike highlight onto its open eye. That rather tiny-looking eye is about the size of the circle you can make with your thumb and forefinger. The rigid eponymous dorsal fin is pinked with the slough of loosened skin.Blood and fluid oozes from a wound near the base of its pectoral fin, as though the percolating corpse is just another leaking tanker. Formerly, whales were the world's wells, civilization's chief source of oil, and we pumped the sea nearly dry of them. We appear to have learned little of whales and nothing of oil. The Japanese cannot get beyond their blood thirst, nor we our oil addiction, and in each case it comes down to nothing more than a matter of national prides hung perversely on things that ought be utmost shame.The average Yank uses twice as much fossil fuel as the average Brit. Compared to 1970, we in the United States use half-again as much energy, increased our paved-road miles by half-again, upped our vehicle-miles-driven by more than 175 percent, increased the size of our average new homes by half-again. In 2007 the U. S. was burning over 20 million barrels of oil a day, about the same as the industrial behemoths Japan, Germany, Russia, China, and India -- combined. God bless us indeed.I notice the whale's got a bruise across its back, and a gash near its eye, possibly from its battering grounding.Whales die. All things die. But when a whale biologist arrives, she examines the oozing bruise and pronounces trauma; a ship has done this.This makes it a death less easily accepted. We stand here in our encounter with an ancient being simply because the ancient being has encountered us first, and tragically.Indeed, the entire world has encountered us. Geologists place time on Earth into great bins and drawers called eons, eras, epochs, and so forth. These mark times when the planet changed its marquee. Each time the theater of life has opened the curtain on a new act -- such as the first appearance of cells, the first multi-celled organisms, the first animals with shells -- and also each time it has brought down the house with mass extinctions, catastrophic meteors, and cycles of ice-ages, it has left a playbill in the rocks. All these ages later, geologists have named and labeled the boundaries of these inter-nested bins and boxes of time. They name the last ice ages as the Pleistocene Epoch. They call the time after them, starting roughly 12,000 years ago, the Holocene, meaning 'whole new time.' It includes all of civilization. And \"whole new time\" may be an understatement.This scene is so full of contrasts that one feels some immense transition arriving on the sea-breeze. Here lies this great and awesome beast, this time-traveling messenger of travail. Several Shinnecock Indians from the nearby reservation arrive and begin singing and chanting. In earlier times, Indians pursued passing whales. Now they grieve their passing. Soon come a phalanx of school children being herded over the dune to gawk and horse around, and a couple of dogs that begin barking at the enormous corpse. From the beachfront mansions, to the metallic gleam and the glint off windshields of arriving cars, to the kids let loose from school, minute by minute, more and more people flood the shore. I stand regarding the whale, listening to the surf and watching the dune-grass shudder. And before long, and even to the cause of death itself, people so dominate the scene that their overwhelming numbers transform the enormous creature that has convened us from monument to amusement.And in just this way a funny thing has happened on the way to the future. In the year 2000 a Nobel laureate suggested that the Holocene is -- finished. Human domination has so changed the world as to constitute a new epoch: the new time of humans -- the Anthropocene. The suggestion surprised many. Geologists are debating. Can it be so?Has the time really come when people are the dominant force on the planetary surface? While the idea of the Anthropocene remains debated by people, to this whale it might have seemed obvious.Adapted from: 2011. The View From Lazy Point. Henry Holt Co.

This movement spurned thousands if not hundreds of thousands of parents to awaken to the larger issue of human rights and the violations of corporations who are blatantly committing environmental child abuse.Two decades ago, the rescue remedies for proving invisible dangers in a child's fragile world fell short and added fuel to the perpetrators who ignored the hazards and went on committing even more crimes by releasing more chemicals without any restrictions.Science was emerging and proved that children were more vulnerable to toxins in the environment but industry with their powerful corporate gut and gateway to the powers that be were able to slide a slippery deck of cards, load all the bases, and cavort with those who wanted bigger and bigger bucks.Abusive, corrosive and mindless thinking led vested interests to eventually sway state and federal government into a war not against the real perpetrator, cancer, but chemicals themselves. And today as we reawaken to statistics found in 1991 in Meyerhoff and Mott's article, we are faced with even more abuse from toxicity.Over 80,000 chemicals continue to leave their pervasive trails in our air water and food supplies.In 2010, New York Times columnist, Nicholas Kristof warned readers that \"some cancers are becoming more common, particularly in children. We don't know why that is,\" he continued, \"but the proliferation of chemicals in water, foods, air and household products is widely suspected as a factor.\" Kristof drew his support for this statement from the President's Cancer Panel, which he called \"the Mount Everest of the medical mainstream.\"When this article was published and the findings of the two-member panel and their conclusions were released it provoked a tremendous backlash from the American Cancer Society.Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, professor of pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and chairman of the school's department of preventive medicine contributed to the hearings having summarized his findings.\"While mortality from childhood cancer has gone sharply down, incidence rates are increasing. There has been a 55% increase from 1975 to 2005 in the incidence of leukemia in 0 to 14-year-olds and an 81% increase for acute lymphocytic leukemia -- the most common type of leukemia. ...The explanation for this increase may be due in part to better diagnostics, but this alone does not account for the continued inexorable rise. Serious consideration must be given to the possibility that environmental factors are involved.\"Twenty two years have passed since my husband and I founded Healthy Child Healthy World in our daughter's memory. We knew from the day we lost her that finding cures for pediatric cancers would take vast amounts of money, billions of dollars of research, all vested in a hope for survival.But in the end we decided that prevention through education was the cure. Giving parents tools to prevent exposure to dangerous chemicals in home and school environments would safeguard their children and help to preserve their sanity as parents.Chemicals know no boundaries. Unleashed into the environment they are the silent killers of today's children and the genetic mutations they cause are the killers of generations to come.Humankind must acknowledge that the only hope we have for true survival as a species is the instinctive need is to help, support and protect our children.If we continue to permit hazardous substances that pose invisible dangers to ourselves and our families that negligence and failure to respond goes beyond, in my opinion, an unwitting form of child abuse... it will lead to the extinction of innocent lives and the loss of joyous memories never to be shared and cherished. Worse the intoxication of corporate greed for the benefit of so few, so few who live to witness that power and wealth just like chemicals have no boundaries but claim it's victims one at a time.LuxEcoLiving Editor's Notes:You can read more about our journey in my manuscript, The Flower That Shattered The Stone."}, {"title": "America's Most Endangered Rivers Of 2012 List", "text": "America may be filled with beautiful rivers and streams, but some of the country's most notable waterways are also its most endangered.

According to American Rivers' report, the river is threatened by both agricultural and urban pollution, along with attempts to roll back the Clean Water Act. The group notes that the polluted Potomac was deemed a \"national disgrace\u201d by President Johnson in 1965, and, according to TreeHugger, was a catalyst for the 1972 Clean Water Act.American Rivers president Bob Irvin said in a statement that the list, \"underscores how important clean water is to our drinking water, health, and economy.

Two journalists present at the incident reported that Wutty was shot after refusing to hand over photographic evidence he had been collecting. A subsequent government inquiry -- open and shut within three days -- not only failed to address the details of his death, but also prohibited further inquiry into the issue Wutty was investigating: namely, the systematic stripping and selling-off of Cambodia's forests.Wutty was part of the Prey Lang Network -- a grassroots group of activists fighting to save the Prey Lang forest, Southeast Asia's last remaining intact lowland evergreen forest. His death is the latest episode in a long and sorry history of Cambodian dissenters being intimidated or even silenced by a kleptocratic elite ransacking the country's natural resources for personal gain. Home to the Kuy indigenous people for centuries, the Prey Lang forest possesses significant biodiversity value as well as being a critical source of water for the country's rice-growing areas. In fact the battle the Kuy are fighting against the march of logging, plantations and mining companies into the forest holds an uncanny resemblance to the plot of Avatar -- and in what might otherwise be a charming example of life imitating art, they have even tried using the film to bring media attention to their cause...Except this is real-life. And the bullets are real.Cambodia has a sad history of state abuse and violence, but Wutty's death and the attention it has begun to receive provides an unprecedented opportunity for the international activist community to pressure the Cambodian government to reform. A growing chorus of NGOs -- including Global Witness -- are calling for a full inquiry into Chut Wutty's death, reform of Cambodia's notoriously corrupt natural resource sector, and an end to the persecution of those who defend forest and land rights. The time has come for the Cambodian government to afford its citizens a meaningful say in what happens to the country's resources; rather than line the pockets of a small, corrupt elite, the riches of Cambodia must serve to lift its people out of poverty.This problem -- and its possible solution -- is not as distant as it might appear. With savagely ironic timing, on the day Wutty was killed, USAID announced a $20m grant to \"support forests and biodiversity\" in Cambodia. The potential for this kind of aid money as a powerful force for good has too long been squandered on landmark conservation projects, many of which have been fatally undermined by the Cambodian Prime Minister and his cronies who habitually plunder resources that might otherwise drive development. To make matters worse, little of this money ever reaches the kind of grassroots organizations Wutty worked with. As a mark of respect for his work -- and to signal our desire for change -- we as US citizens must call on our government to ensure our tax dollars be used to support such groups. The forests they are fighting to defend are not only their homes, but ours as well. They are nothing less than the essence of the natural world.The work of the Prey Lang group is but one example of the heroic and dangerous work being done every day by activists around the world in the essential fight against \"the resource curse.\" We must let them know they are not alone. Making sure our aid money reaches its target is the right place to start.Edward Zwick is a member of the Global Witness Advisory Board."}, {"title": "Share the Road and the Future", "text": "In San Francisco we celebrated Bike to Work Day last week, but so many people are riding their bikes to work here that every day seems like Bike to Work Day. Bicycle ridership is up by 72 percent in the past six years. This has become a much more bicycle-friendly city during the past decade, but the upward trend is national, too: Bicycle commuting in the U.S. was up by 40 percent from 2000 to 2010, and in the largest \"bicycle friendly\" communities (as identified by the League of American Bicyclists), it was up by 77 percent.That's great, but it's only scratching the surface of how biking could transform our country. Most people don't commute to work by bike. Most of us don't even use bikes for any of the relatively short trips we make to and from our homes. Forty percent of all car trips are to destinations less than two miles from home. If every American driver made just one of those trips each week on a bicycle instead of a car (going to church, for instance, or to the health club), we would collectively save nearly 2 billion gallons of gas in a year (not to mention about $7 billion).So why don't we do it?I suspect that if you asked people why they don't use a bike for those short trips, you'd hear one answer more than any other: \"I just don't feel safe riding in traffic.\" That's understandable, because most of our roads and cities have been engineered for the safety and convenience of drivers -- not bicyclists. The solution is two-fold: Better education for both drivers and cyclists on how to safely share the road and, even more important, an investment in reconfiguring our transportation infrastructure so that bicyclists and pedestrians can both feel and be safer.We need to do this not just because it saves on gas, helps the environment, and makes us healthier. We need to do it because many Americans do not drive at all -- about 100 million as of 2009 (and that number will increase as our population ages). Walking or biking (as well as public transit) are the only ways these people can get somewhere on their own.After decades of assuming that only cars matter, we really should be playing catch-up on behalf of other transportation modes. Currently, Americans make about 12 percent of all trips by biking or walking. So what if we invested 15 percent of our federal transportation funding on bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure? Too generous? How about 10 percent? Five percent? Believe it or not, 5 percent would still be more than three times as much as we're currently investing now, which is a measly 1.6 percent.Unfortunately, Big Oil's political allies think that even 1.6 percent is too much.This is National Bike Month.

But people try it,\" said Cal Klewin, executive director of the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway Association, describing the dangerous traffic in the region.For Republican Senator John Hoeven, examples of gridlocked roads in his home state help make the case for fast-tracking the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, which would help take more than 100,000 barrels of oil per day -- about 500 trucks worth -- off of North Dakota roads.Hoeven and other Republicans are pushing to include approvals for TransCanada Corp's pipeline in a new highway funding bill, the details of which are now being hashed out by 47 lawmakers from the Senate and House of Representatives, who face a looming June 30 deadline.The pipeline would run from the Canadian oil sands south to Texas refineries, picking up oil from North Dakota and Montana along the way.President Barack Obama put all but the southernmost portion of the pipeline on hold earlier this year, pending further environmental reviews. He has threatened to veto a highway bill overriding his decision.Many Democratic lawmakers have argued the Keystone permit provision does not belong in the transportation bill. They say the fight to include it puts at risk as many as three million jobs fixing roads and bridges.\"We're talking about a highway bill, aren't we? This relates directly to highways,\" Hoeven said in an interview.\"Those pipelines take trucks off the roads,\" he said, pulling a road atlas out of his Capitol Hill desk to point out highways in his state suffering from traffic-overload.Klewin's group is pushing for a four-lane highway to help move the trucks carrying supplies to and from drilling sites and reduce the number of red pins on the sheriff's map. The pipeline would also help, he said.\"I think we need both,\" Klewin said.In Washington, lawmakers' staff have logged about 20 hours of work so far finding areas of agreement on the bill, said Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, chairman of the conference panel.\"We haven't got down to areas of disagreement, and we will,\" Boxer told reporters, when asked about the Keystone pipeline.The final bill will need to find enough votes in the House and Senate to pass, she noted.\"What I've said from the start is, if you load this up with controversy that can't get through either house, it's a problem.\"Boxer said she will meet on Thursday with John Mica, the top House Republican on the conference committee, and will meet one-on-one with members over coffee on particular issues.She said she will brief all 47 members of the committee this week on progress, and give a public update of the private talks to reporters once a week.\"I am optimistic the conferees will reach agreement on this bill,\" Boxer said, citing strong letters from business groups and unions urging lawmakers to finish their work by the deadline."}, {"title": "The Illegal Wildlife Trade: A Survey of Greed, Tragedy, and Ignorance", "text": "Since the beginning of 2012, over 250 elephants have been killed in Cameroon. Adults are being slaughtered for ivory to be used for jewelry, ornaments, and traditional medicine; young juveniles and infants are being killed indiscriminately or left orphaned to die without the protection of their mothers. Having lived in Kenya and Tanzania earlier in my life, I experienced firsthand the wonder of African elephants in their native habitats. That's why I feel a personal sense of outrage at the senseless and immoral killing of wildlife. We should all feel outrage -- even those who have not had the privilege to see elephants close up -- because the conservation of our planet's wildlife is an moral obligation we all share. The U.S. government has consistently been among the leaders in the efforts to protect elephants and other wildlife, but to be effective it's vital that all governments and citizens take ownership and pride in the biodiversity of their communities.Despite the elephant massacre in Cameroon, we've made some progress. A decision of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1989 made ivory trade effectively illegal. Before the CITES ban, poaching for ivory led to a dramatic decline in the African elephant population (from an estimated 1.2 million African elephants in the late 1970s to less than 500,000 in 1989). The ban was -- at least until recently--relatively successful, helping to sustain, and aid the recovery of, elephant populations in several countries. Unfortunately, the trend seems to be reversing because of growing demand for ivory from Asia, in particular in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.Cameroonian elephants have fallen victim to armed poachers invading from Chad and Sudan. A third to a half of the savanna elephant population in the Bouba Ndjida National Park, in northern Cameroon, have been killed. Park rangers and local authorities are no match for highly organized poachers, who are armed with automatic weaponry and employ ruthless tactics. The Cameroonian government authorized military intervention to protect elephant populations in March, with some success. Although the poachers have been driven out of the park and some weapons and ivory tusks confiscated, the threat continues because demand for ivory is high and there is money to be made. A pound of raw ivory sells for about $400 on the black market and, in China, ivory bracelets and earrings can fetch upwards of $300.INTERPOL estimates illegal wildlife trade to be worth between $10-20 billion annually. Conservation efforts are thwarted, local communities are robbed of economic resources, and biodiversity is reduced when species are taken from the wild. The loss in ecosystem resilience affects fresh water supply and food production. Rule of law and national security issues are also a concern. Organized crime is attracted to wildlife trafficking for its profitability, small risk of prosecution, as well as light fines and jail sentences. Criminals who deliberately cross international borders, violate national laws with relative impunity, and attempt to corrupt government officials are a serious threat to the stability, economy, and natural resources of a country. In Cameroon, for example, proceeds from poached ivory will likely finance the purchase of weapons and ammunition, further exacerbating conflict in the region.To catch poachers, we need to help other countries reinforce customs and border controls, enact tougher wildlife crime laws, educate prosecutors and the judges about the seriousness of such crimes, and provide resources and training to law enforcement authorities. And, it's vital that we curb demand for ivory as well as other wild animals and derived parts (e.g., rhino horns, tortoise shells, bear paws, and exotic birds). Consumers need to be made aware that wearing wildlife is not attractive nor will consuming wildlife products likely cure their ailments. They cannot claim ignorance when it comes to the cruel tactics poachers employ and the lives -- both human and animal -- that are lost in the name of fads and fashions.  The United States has been at the forefront of international efforts to dismantle and bring a halt to the illegal wildlife trade. In 2005, the Department of State launched the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking. And, in July 2011, the White House released the President's National Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime and Converging Threats to National Security; this highlighted environmental crimes as being among the top five most lucrative criminal activities. The Department of State has helped to form regional wildlife enforcement networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America. And, in April, the U.S. embassies in Gabon and the Central African Republic -- in partnership with the Government of Gabon -- brought together law enforcement, government officials, and conservations to share best practices to curb illicit wildlife trafficking.Neither governments nor individual citizens can afford to stand idle while poachers and wildlife traffickers hunt elephants, or any threatened species. Collective outrage at these horrendous crimes is needed to spur action. The United States will continue to support citizens and governments to protect our planet's wildlife."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - May 15, 2012", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport.The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!.IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Ominous start to summer fire season; Watch out for hot air in a newly uncovered anti-wind propaganda campaign; The Saudi Arabia of Oil wants to become the Saudi Arabia of Solar; PLUS:  House Republicans working to block advanced biofuels for the U.S. military ...

The film \u201cGasland\u201d was born of that need to protect the watershed, as well as something he describes as \u201ca fundamental human impulse to contribute to the dialogue in society, community and civilization and participate in the betterment of humanity.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re only motivated by our own self-interests,\u201d he tells MNN. \u201cOften out of crisis comes this enormous wellspring of generosity and motivation. As a documentarian I\u2019ve been witness to that effort and what I\u2019ve tried to do is bring that impulse out into the film.\u201dTo have something that was intended to have local impact wind up nominated for an Oscar and be seen by millions of people in 30 countries leaves Fox honored, amazed and gratified that he\u2019s been able to expose information about fracking and gas drilling and tell personal stories about people that have been affected by these practices.\u201cI think \u2018Gasland\u2019 is the doorway for a lot of people to see something happening in their backyard and realize the national and global implications,\u201d says Fox, who will continue to examine these issues in \u201cGasland 2.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the way in which the fossil fuel industry has attacked the fundamentals of our democracy and spends enormous amounts of money trying to undermine the citizens\u2019 voice in Albany, Sacramento, Washington and all across the nation,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a lot of topics to be investigated. Every single dollar spent lobbying a legislator on behalf of oil and gas is a toxic dollar that undermines public health and safety laws that protect Americans. That\u2019s contamination of the political system.\u201dIn addition to working on \u201cGasland 2,\u201d Fox is preparing a dramatic film adaptation of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s \u201cEnemy of the People.\u201d He also tells MNN that speaking engagements and grassroots organizing has \u201cbecome a full-time job.\u201d\u201cI think the biggest issue facing our world right now is making the transition away from fossil fuels before we head into a disastrous situation of runaway climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, the oil, coal and gas industries and their unprecedented greed and capacity to fight dirty stand in the way, suppressing new technology and obstructing progress in a way that\u2019s unnatural for our society. But whenever you see a big greedy gas company try to pull a fast one you\u2019re going to encounter another force of will, which is an internal mechanism for justice and change.\u201dHe says he\u2019s all for individuals doing things like unplugging electronics to stem \u201cvampire\u201d power load, buying power from renewable solar or wind sources, installing solar roof panels, and driving and flying less. He\u2019s even looking into a new bio-digestion system that turns food waste into gas for the kitchen stove. \u201cBut if you spend all your time obsessing about turning your lights off and no time at all in the political process, you\u2019re kidding yourself,\u201d Fox says.\u201cWe need policy change, and the most important thing people can do is to contribute and participate in the political process. We have to vote climate change deniers and people who will create subsidies for the fossil fuel industry out of office. We have to protest when bad decisions are being made about fracking or tar sands. That is the most valuable thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint.\u201dFox points out that the environmental laws enacted under Richard Nixon were adopted because of public pressure, and is dismayed by \u201cthe distressing signs in the Obama administration that we\u2019re walking backward on a lot of crucial policies that they pioneered in the first few years, since it\u2019s an election year.\u201dNevertheless, Fox says we\u2019d be better off environmentally if Obama remains in office. \u201cBut we have to take back our power and create sources of renewable energy. We have to campaign for that and take back our political power and show the fossil fuel industry that we care about this.

Speaking to the Blue-Green Alliance's Detroit \"Good Jobs-Green Jobs\" Conference, Dingell sounded a simple theme. Americans are all in the environmental crisis together, they are all in the economic crisis together, and the two crises have a common solution -- making every job a green job. \"You can't tell a fellow passenger, hey, you're end of the boat is sinking, \" Dingell points out, and urges the audience to go beyond looking for green jobs, but to make every job greener.\"We can't afford to have an economy in which some jobs work for the future. We need an economy in which they all do. We haven't inherited the earth from those who went before us. We have borrowed it from those who follow. We have an absolute moral obligation to hand it over in better shape than we received it.\"Dingell manages the remarkable task of describing the broken state of American politics -- everyone understands that the hyper-partisanship of Washington is his text -- without calling names, but at the same time without making excuses for those who are responsible.The surprising thing about this conference is that the Blue-Green Alliance -- now the largest progressive coalition in the nation, with organizations representing 14 million members belonging, finds itself at the absolute heart of the nation's 2012 economic and political conversation. Bob King, the president of the UAW, and Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow, and Associate Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman are here to address the stunning recovery of the American auto industry -- with 200,000 new jobs added in two years, and another 100,000 in the works, and all three Detroit manufacturers increasing U.S. market share for the first time in years. As Stabenow says, this is the moment when America beings \"exporting our ideas, not our jobs.\"  So dynamic is Greater Detroit today that it is the single biggest center of clean energy patents in the world -- and the U.S. Patent Office is opening its first regional branch here in Detroit. The success is driven by a new commitment to innovation, technology and sustainability -- with electric drive train vehicles at the head of the parade. The U.S. two years ago had 3% of the world's advanced battery manufacturing capability -- by 2015 we will have grown that to 40%, unquestionably the biggest, fastest recovery in the twenty years history of the hollowing out of \"Made in America.\"This success was built on the decision by President Obama to rescue the auto industry. The victory is, correspondingly, very threatening to those whose vision of the American future is based on a few winners and a lot of losers. While the public is focused on the need for jobs, the Tea Party/Koch complex is focused on the threat posed by clean energy -- because it brings Americans together and requires government leadership. In April, 16,991 negative political spots were shown around America. And 13,748 of them -- or 81 percent -- focused on energy, according to data provided by New York-based Kantar Media's CMAG, which tracks advertising.While oil and coal to provide a lot of the money for these ads, they don't provide 81% of the money -- so clearly the American extreme right has decided that the opportunity clean energy and innovation offer for those American who believe, with Representative Dingell, that we are all in the same boat, is simply too threatening to ignore.Not only will the future of clean energy innovation and manufacturing shape the kind of climate and environment we hand off when we return the Earth to our children -- it's also going to determine whether, as Dingell said, we restore the America we all love."}, {"title": "Arctic Drilling Opponents Swarm The White House", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Because sometimes to get your point across you need to dress up as an Arctic Tern, scores of anti-drilling activists on Tuesday gathered outside the White House dressed in fuzzy onesies and polar bear masks.The demonstration -- organized by Green Peace, Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, 350.org, Credo Action and Alaska Wilderness League, among other environmental groups -- comes as part of a larger effort to pressure President Barack Obama to stop drilling in the Arctic's Chukchi Sea, home to such iconic species as the polar bear, bowhead whale and walrus.\"We're out here today to deliver a million comments to Obama asking him not to allow Shell to drill this summer,\" Leah Donahey, western Arctic and oceans program director at Alaska Wilderness League, told The Huffington Post at Tuesday's rally.Last fall, the Obama administration affirmed a decision to offer millions of acres of the ocean for sale to oil companies.

Scientists say oil and gas seeps surrounding BP's Deepwater Horizon well appear to be mostly natural and to pre-date the 2010 spill. But some experts wonder if at least some of the seeps might have been caused or expanded by the well's drilling, blowout or capping. They worry subsea rock near the well may have been fractured. And they're waiting to learn more from data collected by the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process -- under way now in response to the spill.Seeps begin in fractures in subsea rock formations containing oil and gas deposits. Hydrocarbons are gradually released by seeps onto the sea floor and into the water column and sea's surface.In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the geology of the continental slope promotes the release of hydrocarbons from the seafloor, according to Harry Roberts, Boyd professor emeritus at Louisiana State University's Coastal Studies Institute. \"Using three-dimensional, seismic data, over 22,000 natural seep sites have been mapped in the region, including quite a few in the vicinity of the Macondo well site,\" he said last week. Natural seeps can be active for years, constantly releasing gas and crude oil.Roberts said \"gas ascending through the water column may go into solution before it reaches the sea surface, depending on the water's depth.\" Oil droplets and gas bubbles covered with oil reach the surface, and the oil spreads out to make sea-surface slicks. On calm days in the Gulf, when wave action is moderate, slicks can be observed in many places on the continental slope from satellite data, Roberts said.Pilots and mariners see the slicks too, and report them to authorities.How are seeps studied? \"Hard bottom limestone, created by microbial oxidation of hydrocarbons at seep sites and by communities of seep-related organisms, make the seafloor highly reflective of acoustic energy,\" Roberts said. \"These seep sites can be identified and mapped by analyzing the seafloor return from 3-D seismic data.\" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ship Okeanos Explorer is in the Gulf now, mapping gas plumes from natural seeps, he noted.Roberts, who has been studying the northern Gulf's natural seeps since 1985, said he believes the blowout at the Macondo well had little effect on natural seep sites in the area.In another opinion from LSU, emeritus professor of environmental sciences Ed Overton said \"My understanding is that seeps caused by drilling and caps are infrequent relative to the large number of natural seeps in the Gulf.\"At Texas A&M, oceanography professor Norman Guinasso, deputy director of the university's Geochemical and Environmental Research Group, said seeps near BP's blowout predated the drilling of that well. \"We've been studying oil and gas seeps in MC118, which is about ten miles from the Macondo site, for many years,\" he said. \"These seeps were there long before the Macondo well was drilled.\"LSU oceanography professor Robert Carney, who studies the Gulf seafloor, said a key difference between seeps and industry leaks is that \"in natural seeps, oil takes a long time to move up through rock and mud, whereas oil and gas from drilling will come up rather quickly.\"Associating seeps and sheens near the Deepwater Horizon with the well itself is a knee-jerk response, some experts said. Houston-based geologist and oil consultant Arthur Berman said \"everybody wants to make a connection between seeps and the BP spill, and I've received a lot of calls about it.\" But, he said, a great deal of oil enters the Gulf through natural seeps, with estimates running anywhere from 1,500 to 19,000 barrels per day. He added \"it's mostly around salt domes.\"Looking back two years, Berman said \"as long as the Macondo well was still flowing, the probability of leakage would have been almost zero because fluids take the path of least resistance, and that was through the pipe. My experience tells me fluids went out the rupture at the well head. Given what we know about the Macondo well now, I don't think it caused additional rock fracturing or new seeps.\"To keep track of seeps, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has mapped over 22,000 active and inactive sites in the Gulf with 3-D seismic data, BOEM spokesman John Filostrat said last week. \"Most are gas only,\" he noted. He said sea-surface oil slicks must be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, which then relays them to BOEM. \"We map these reports\" at BOEM, he said.After a 10-mile oil sheen appeared in the Gulf on April 12 at a distance from Venice, La., BOEM's sister agency, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, said a modest amount of oil had been released from a natural seep -- based on video from Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which used remotely operated vehicles to examine the sheen. The sheen appeared in the general area of two Shell platforms.But some scientists are sceptical that the all seeps near the Macondo site are natural. Singapore-based geohazards expert BK Lim, who has been monitoring the Gulf from Asia since the BP spill, suspects the Deepwater Horizon well has been leaking for two years. \"I believe that some of the oil just took available pathways to the seabed,\" he said. \"Natural seeps do not as a rule produce sudden, oil slicks running for miles, as we saw in March 2011 and this April in the Gulf.\" Oil from a 30-mile slick washed up from Grande Isle westward in late March of last year.Lim said the March 2011 and April 2012 slicks in the Gulf may have been related to seismic events -- earthquakes in Japan and Sumatra, respectively, in those months -- that shook soft sediment near the Deepwater Horizon and discharged oil. A 9.0 magnitude quake jolted Japan on March 11, 2011, and an 8.7 quake rattled Sumatra, Indonesia on April 11, 2012.Yuba City, Ca.-based geologist Chris Landau said \"it would have been easy to understand the Gulf oil blowout and its consequences if they would have just shown us the mud logs -- a graphical, foot-by-foot map of what geologists make while drilling goes on.\" He added \"they are your diary and forensic tool -- the black box that explains how and why the jet crashed,\" in reference to airline disasters.A mud log is a record of activity prepared by a petroleum geologist's assistant, or logger, during well drilling. The log contains geological information on the drilled hole, mud characteristics, indications or \"shows\"of oil and gas, and drill times.Two years after the fact, those records will be on a government website soon. \"Mud log data for the Macondo well should be released on our website this June,\" BSEE spokeswoman Chauntra Rideaux said last week.Meanwhile, NOAA has been gathering data on seeps that can be viewed by the public. Scientists on board NOAA's ship Okeanos Explorer in the Gulf have tested multibeam sonar, or echo-sounding technology, to map gaseous seeps in the water column, NOAA spokesman Fred Gorell said last week. Multibeam sonar can survey wide swathes of the seafloor and water column, he explained. \"We obtain and share information for others to study and characterize,\" he said. \"The data is rich and voluminous. It's not on our website, but can be accessed at NOAA data centers.\" Gorell said seep-data collection by the Okeanos has been independent of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment or NRDA process.Federal and state government NRDA projects, funded by BP and often involving universities, are part of an effort to restore the Gulf to pre-spill conditions. Several professors contacted for this article were unable to talk because of their NRDA research work. NOAA is collecting information directly for the NRDA process, partly through research cruises, and some of the data will be used in the government's legal case against BP. More on the agency's role in NRDA can be found on www.gulfspillrestoration.noaa.govOil seeps and slicks near the Deepwater Horizon and whether or not subsea rock was fractured are among the many concerns to be discussed in a BP spill trial involving the federal government and Gulf states, scheduled to start next January 14 in U.S. District Court in New Orleans. \"Anything and everything will come up in that trial,\" Arthur Berman predicted."}, {"title": "7 Ridiculously Expensive Cat And Dog Breeds: Pricey Pets", "text": "There are more than 150 million dogs and cats in the United States and close to four in 10 homes count a feline or canine as a member of the family.

By the end of the day, Simon Sparrow, who had not yet turned 2, would succumb to an increasingly common infection called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).MRSA may have been the official cause of death, but Macario suggested that Simon really died as a \"direct result of all of us misusing and overusing antibiotics\" in both humans and food animals. Macario joins 30-some parents, pediatricians and organic farmers as part of the group Supermoms Against Superbugs, who are converging on Capitol Hill Tuesday to ask the federal government to rein in the use of antibiotics in agriculture, in hopes of preserving the efficacy of antibiotics and protecting children's health.\"Yes, doctors are overprescribing. That has contributed,\" added Macario, who is also co-founder of the MRSA Research Center. \"But now the Mount Everest challenge is to get farmers to stop using antibiotics in animal feed and water.\"According to the latest estimates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 80 percent of antibiotics are given to food animals -- with the majority of those used for growth promotion or disease prevention rather than for treatment. Overall, the more antibiotics used, experts warn, the more microbes become resistant to those drugs -- and the more people may be exposed to drug residues and drug-resistant genes in their food, water and the environment. It's survival of the fittest at a microscopic level.Compounding the issue is the ability of bacteria to share their drug-evasion secrets with one another while mingling in an animal's or human's gut, in a swine feces lagoon or in a river. For example, even if a particular drug-resistant microbe isn't capable of causing illness in humans itself, its DNA could find its way into more malignant microbes that might infect a child.Despite the progress that's been made in limiting unnecessary antibiotic use in humans, Dr. Cecilia Di Pentima, an infectious disease pediatrician at Vanderbilt University, shares Macario's broader concerns. \"We're failing as a society in preserving antibiotics,\" she said, \"and we're paying for it.\"Di Pentima has also joined Supermoms Against Superbugs in D.C. to share the tragic ramifications she witnesses first-hand in her daily practice -- from MRSA to other dangerous infections, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and multi-drug resistant, gram-negative bacteria.\"For us, it's a daily struggle with very sick kids,\" said Di Pentima. \"Even healthy kids who have never been in a hospital can come in with infections resistant to almost all antibiotics.\"She and other doctors now frequently resort to either higher doses of drugs, more toxic drugs or both. Di Pentima said that she is seeing increased rates of kidney failure as a result. In the worst cases, like Simon's, there might be no alternatives at all.Ruby Lee of Troutdale, Ore., was only 10 months old when she got sick after eating ground turkey meatballs infected with a form of salmonella resistant to multiple antibiotics. Fortunately, her doctor eventually found an antibiotic, cephalosporin, that effectively defeated the bacteria and saved her life. Ruby's mother, Melissa Lee, is also among the group visiting today with the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the White House. She, too, wants to ensure that other families don't have to suffer as hers did.In January, the FDA prohibited certain uses of cephalosporins in cattle, swine, chickens and turkeys. The move was welcomed by advocates, who also suggested that it was not nearly enough to combat the overall rise in antibiotic-resistant superbugs.A similarly contentious response was sparked when the FDA released guidelines last month that asks pork, beef and poultry producers to stop using antibiotics voluntarily for fattening up their livestock.Those guidelines still allow broad use in animals for disease prevention, noted Laura Rogers, project director for the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming, which organized today's event alongside the American Academy of Pediatrics. \"Oftentimes dosages for prevention are the same as those used for growth promotion,\" she said. \"If we just call it something else, we won't see drug use go down.\"Other regulatory targets for advocates include the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which was re-introduced in March 2011 after getting buried in Congress in 2007 and 2009, as well as a recent order from a federal court that the FDA follow through on a rule proposed in 1977 to withdraw approvals for most non-therapeutic uses of penicillin and tetracyclines in livestock -- both drugs crucial in human medicine.\"We're going to ask whoever we meet with on Capitol Hill to help support legislation that will reduce misuse and overuse of antibiotics in industrial food animal farms, because that is contributing to antibiotic resistance in a major way,\" Macario said. \"If we don't do something about it, more children are going to die. That's a fact.\"In addition to participating with the Supermoms virtually via Facebook and Twitter, Macario also reminds parents of their ability to influence change at home.\"They can make their voices heard by buying meat and eggs that originated at farms that don't use antibiotics, and when they go to restaurants, they can demand food raised without antibiotics,\" she said. \"Ultimately, consumer demand is going to drive change.\""}, {"title": "Will You Pay as New Reactors Jump $900 Million in Just Three Months?", "text": "The projected price for Georgia's Vogtle Double Reactor Project has jumped at least $900 million in just three months -- and that's just for starters.Will you pay for it? The future of new atomic power in the U.S. hangs in the balance.A national grassroots campaign is now working to stop tax/ratepayer handouts and kill the project.Construction there is defined by faulty concrete and non-spec rebar steel that threaten public safety and could delay completion dates beyond those projected even before construction began.South Carolina's V.C. Summer, the only other new U.S. reactor project now under construction, is meeting fierce ratepayer resistance in two states. From Iowa to Brazil, Japan to France, the global reactor industry is collapsing in tandem. But what other nations will it bankrupt and irradiate before it's finished?President Obama has tagged $8.33 billion in loan guarantees for Vogtle's construction. And Georgia ratepayers are being forced to pay for it in advance.But the Office of Management and Budget is still dickering over terms with the Southern Company. Vogtle's prime builders want to put up little or no money. They want interest rates lower than what you would pay to buy a new house. They expect you to take primary liability for future disasters. They can't say what will happen to the radioactive waste.The real price tags for both Vogtle and Summer are suspect. Original estimates have been as low as $2 to $4 billion per reactor. But Florida's Progress Energy has just admitted its proposed reactors for Levy County, near Tampa, would go as high as $9.5 to $12 billion each.Given their delays and structural defects, there's no reason to believe Vogtle or Summer could come in cheaper. At those prices, they cannot begin to compete with new renewables or efficiency.So where does that leave Vogtle's federal loan guarantees? George W. Bush set aside $18.5 billion at the Department of Energy for new reactor funding, but made no grants. Despite fierce lobbying, industry attempts to add to the fund have been defeated by national grassroots campaigns.Obama designated the first $8.33 for Vogtle in 2010. But closed-door negotiations between his OMB, the DOE and Southern have been inconclusive.The $535 million failure of Solyndra Solar loans has cast a shadow over the entire federal guarantee system. The proposed Vogtle guarantee is 15 times bigger. At least three national petitions are circulating to kill it.Southern has hinted it might seek better terms from private lenders. But Wall Street has long scorned atomic investments. And Georgia ratepayers are already being soaked for hundreds of millions to pay in advance for reactors sinking in debt and increasingly unlikely to ever operate. In both South and North Carolina, ratepayers are revolting against skyrocketing rate hikes to build Summer.In a major defeat for the nuclear industry, the Iowa legislature adjourned without voting advance rate hikes to build nukes there. Similar legislation is stalled in Missouri and under attack in Florida. Brazil has announced it will build no more reactors. Despite fierce federal attempts to reopen them, all Japan's commercial reactors remain shut.New President Francois Hollande has pledged to phase down France's dependency on atomic power. A construction project at Flamanville (like one in Finland) is sinking in devastating overruns and delays. Whether Hollande will proceed there or at any other remains to be seen.But France's new nuclear hesitancy may kill new reactor projects in Great Britain. They have been posited on support from Electricite de France, now under attack from Hollande and a skeptical banking system being hammered by Europe's financial crisis.In India, many of the 350-plus women committed to a fast-unto-death against the Koodankulam reactors have entered critical life-threatening stages. Police-state tactics have escalated the mass confrontation at the site.Only China still seems a hold out for large-scale new construction. As grassroots anti-nuclear campaign there begin, the central government has not yet announced its post-Fukushima decision on whether to proceed with some 30-plus proposed new reactors.But at Fukushima itself, we still face a potentially catastrophic situation at Unit Four's spent fuel pool, still perched 100 feet in the air. Tons of horrifically radioactive rods remain at the mercy of an earthquake that could send them crashing to the ground, spewing releases that can only be termed \"apocalyptic.\"In California, a failed $960 million \"upgrade\" at California's San Onofre has led to steam generator tube failures shutting two reactors with no firm reopening date. More than a $1 billion spent by Progress Energy at Florida's Crystal River may also doom it to long overdue burial.In Vermont, New York, Texas, Ohio and elsewhere else there are operating reactors, escalating leaks, flaws, errors and advanced aging define a supremely dangerous industry falling apart at its faulty welds.So far there have been no balanced national hearings on the future of Votle's loan guarantees, or continued construction at Summer. But this latest $900 million price jump casts yet another deadly shadow over America's nuclear future.It's time to kill this loan -- and this industry -- and put our money into green-powering our planet.Our economic and ecological survival depend on it."}, {"title": "Waterkeepers Washington File Amicus Brief in State Supreme Court Case Over Non-Point Source Water Pollution", "text": "A case that could seriously alter the Washington State Department of Ecology's ability to address non-point source pollution under State law has us standing strong behind our state's regulatory agency.At issue is Joseph Lemire, 68, a cattle rancher near Dayton, WA and a 2009 order from the Department of Ecology that required him to stop allowing cattle access to Pataha Creek -- a creek that is already listed as an impaired body of water. The worry is that when cattle use streams for drinking, they trample the natural shoreline and leave their fecal waste in the water, polluting not only the stream, but also lakes and rivers downstream.Lemire appealed the order in 2011 to the Pollution Control Hearings Board objecting to the scope of the order and disputing the fact that the livestock were actually causing pollution. The PCHB ruled that \"The outcome of this appeal is not dependent on testing of Pataha Creek, as the agency need only show the substantial potential for pollution to occur,\" and granted Ecology's motion to dismiss the case.\" Lemire then appealed that decision to the Columbia County Superior Court, which found in Lemire's favor, overturning the PCHB decision.In late September 2011, Ecology filed an appeal with the Washington State Court of Appeals to overturn the decision by the Columbia County Superior Court that prohibits Ecology from taking action to keep cattle from polluting streams and rivers. \"We think the judge has it wrong. His ruling strikes at our fundamental authority to help prevent pollution in the water in the state,\" said Kelly Susewind, Ecology's Water Quality Program manager in Olympia. Ecology had this to say about their decision to appeal,Because of the importance of maintaining our ability to protect water quality statewide, and because clean water is a statewide resource necessary for the health and safety of our citizens, businesses and communities as well as our fish, Ecology will ask the state appellate court to review the facts. The Clean Water Act prohibits polluting the state's water. A healthy agricultural industry and clean water are equally essential to our state's economy and way of life. Both depend on clean water.And that's where we (Spokane Riverkeeper, Columbia Riverkeeper, North Sound Baykeeper and Puget Soundkeeper -- \"Waterkeepers Washington\") step in. Helping Ecology maintain its ability to address water quality is about as important as an action as we as Keepers can take in the state of Washington. Especially now, in a time where the threat to weaken environmental regulations and oversight is increasing. We intend to help Ecology maintain its authority to regulate non-point source pollution, a major threat to waterbodies across the state, especially the Spokane. So last week, on May 10th, Waterkeepers Washington filed an Amicus Brief in support of the State of Washington, Department of Ecology stating:The degradation of the Pataha Creek and other Washington water bodies from unmanaged nonpoint sources of pollution, such as cattle, are serious concerns to Waterkeepers Washington. Without the authority to regulate nonpoint source pollution and its precursors, Ecology lacks essential tools necessary to control water pollution and meet the requirements of both state and federal law. The burden of all water pollution within Washington will rest upon point source operations and community groups to find non-regulatory methods of combating nonpoint source pollution. Ecology is better suited to implement the necessary best management practices to combat nonpoint source pollution and mitigate the regulatory burden on point source pollution.Waterkeepers Washington joins with Ecology and respectfully requests that the court reverse the superior court's decision and uphold the Board's decision affirming Ecology's Order that is supported by the record.Because I too am not a lawyer, here's what an Amicus Brief or Amici Curiae is: \"Literally, friend of the court. A person with strong interest in or views on the subject matter of an action, but not a party to the action, may petition the court for permission to file a brief, ostensibly on behalf of a party but actually to suggest a rationale consistent with its own views. Such amicus curiae briefs are commonly filed in appeals concerning matters of a broad public interest; e.g., civil rights cases. They may be filed by private persons or the government. In appeals to the U.S. courts of appeals, an amicus brief may be filed only if accompanied by written consent of all parties, or by leave of court granted on motion or at the request of the court, except that consent or leave shall not be required when the brief is presented by the United States or an officer or agency thereof.\"Here are some photos taken by Ecology of Lemire's ranch.To sum up, here is the closing from our Brief:Ecology has the authority to regulate and manage nonpoint source water pollution. Ecology's Order represents the proper manifestation of the Ecology's authority pursuant to both the Clean Water Act and the Washington Water Pollution Control Act to control nonpoint source and its precursors. Lemire's cattle ranching practices posed a substantial potential to pollute the Pataha Creek. Ecology's ability to regulate similarly situated land owners that violate the Washington Water Pollution Control Act is of great importance to Waterkeepers Washington and the residents of Washington."}, {"title": "River Rally Rocks the Planet", "text": "I'm often asked how I manage to be hopeful for the future when I spend a great deal of time publishing news about the daunting environmental problems impacting the world. I reply that it's because of the passion and commitment of the people I know who work hard every day to protect the planet we all share.There's no better example of the warriors working toward a sustainable future than the 700 people who attended River Rally in Portland, OR May 4-7. For the first time, River Network and Waterkeeper Alliance joined forces to host River Rally with attendees from more than 40 U.S. states as well as Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Mexico, Peru, Senegal and the United Kingdom.The opening reception included a Tribal Invocation by Gerald Lewis, a Yakama Nation Tribal Councilman and Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission Chairman. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson gave the evening's keynote address.The following morning began with Alexandra Cousteau, National Geographic Emerging Explorer and founder of Blue Legacy, relaying \"the need to tell our stories\" and how \"we have to shine the light on the important work people are doing\" to protect the world's water.During the four days of the conference, water advocates spent time in workshops that shared best practices for watershed restoration, stormwater management, water quality monitoring, water and energy conservation, green infrastructure, habitat restoration, safe drinking water and more.The keynote speaker for Saturday eventing was Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, senior attorney for Natural Resources Defense Council and president of Waterkeeper Alliance, who was introduced by James Curleigh, CEO of Keen Footwear, one of the leading sponsors of the Rally.Curleigh's exuberance shined through as he philosophized on \"living a HybridLife\" -- having a commitment to create, play and care. He then introduced Kennedy, referring to him as \"a legend and the ultimate water warrior.\"Kennedy also keynoted a rally in Portland with more than 400 people on May 7 opposing the exporting of coal and six coal export terminals proposed for Oregon and Washington that would ship 150 million tons of coal per year from Wyoming and Montana to Asia.The last night of the conference was the River Heroes Reception, which celebrated the work of many of the water advocates through the presentation of awards from their colleagues.Throughout the conference, I had the opportunity to sit down with many of the Keepers and River Network affiliates to get the skinny on their work.One of the most interesting stories I heard came from Nabil Musa, the Iraq Upper Tigris Waterkeeper. Musa discussed the many problems Iraq's watershed faces due to pollution and degradation of the rivers themselves, and upstream water diversion projects. He also mentioned the challenges he faces as an advocate in a country where government decision-makers view the rivers as abstract resources that they can pollute, divert, drain and trade away without consideration of the communities and ecosystems that are destroyed.Danielle Katz, founder and executive director of Rivers for Change, talked about the 12 Rivers in 2012 campaign that will explore, sample and record conditions on 12 critical California rivers as they paddle from Source to Sea down these watersheds. The campaign will highlight the health of these local ecosystems to help promote the interconnectedness and interdependence of our states' communities on this precious resource.I met with Carla Garcia Zendejas, a board member of Bahia Magdalena Baykeeper and Tijuana Waterkeeper. Bahia Magdalena works along the Pacific coast of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Julio Solis serves as Magdalena Baykeeper and works to protect mangroves and gray whale breeding grounds against unsustainable large-scale tourism development. Tijuana Waterkeeper is on the U.S.-Mexico border in Baja California. Margarita Diaz serves as Tijuana Waterkeeper and works to improve conditions of the Tijuana River watershed due to challenges from the lack of sewage infrastructure, and educates the public and governmental officials on the consequences of polluting the waterway.Cathy Kellon and Kate Carone from Ecotrust talked about the Whole Watershed Restoration Initiative that focuses on restoring salmon spawning and rearing habitat to ensure recovery of Pacific Northwest salmon and steelhead.Spokane Riverkeeper Bart Mihailovich shared his story about trying to reverse a culture of non-compliance with state, federal and tribal clean water laws. From addressing toxic runoff to holding dischargers accountable, Spokane Riverkeeper is restoring a river that for generations has been the main vein of the great Inland Northwest.Brenda Archambo, president of Sturgeon For Tomorrow, explained the importance of protecting the bottom-dwelling, ancient species of lake sturgeon and how she assists fisheries managers in the rehabilitation of this species that made its first appearance about 136 million years ago.I sat down with Krystyn Tully, vice president of Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, who told me about the new Swim Guide, an app that makes it easy to explore and enjoy the best beaches near the Great Lakes, California Coast, Florida and Alabama.While hanging out in the hotel lobby, I ran into Hans Cole from Patagonia, the sponsor of the scholarship fund for River Rally. I thanked him for his support and he replied, \"We know how important it is for grassroots activists working on the front lines of the environmental crisis to get the right training and to feel connected to a larger community.\"Thanks to the leadership of executive directors Marc Yaggi from Waterkeeper Alliance and Todd Ambs from River Network for having the foresight to combine efforts and create the largest international gathering of water protection advocates.I'm grateful for the time I spent with these incredible water warriors who are making a difference in their communities and local watersheds. There's nothing like spending five days with kindred spirits in the lush Pacific Northwest to rejuvenate the soul and rekindle the fire to go back home and continue the work of protecting our planet.

Sustainability Initiative Boosts School Pride", "text": "The students at William Paterson University clearly take a lot of pride in their sustainability initiatives. As a finalist for the 2012 Second Nature Climate Leadership Awards, they won the public voting competition on Planet Forward featuring their innovative climate leadership. The video details how the campus has come together to support the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment and related sustainability initiatives, which includes a massive solar installation and a new bachelor's degree in environmental sustainability.Check it out:William Paterson adopted a climate action plan in 2009 that puts the university on a path to becoming carbon neutral by 2065 (and reduce their baseline by 50 percent by 2025). A cornerstone of that work is their 3.5 MW solar array that snakes around parking lots and buildings. It's quite amazing, and a strong visual reminder on campus of the university's climate commitment, not to mention the fact that the project will pay for itself in just five years.Budget conscious universities take heed: the university has spent less than $250,000 on their energy reduction projects and has saved $10.5 million in energy costs. That's a tremendous amount of saving for doing something that's good for the planet and enrollment numbers.If the comments that were left on the university's page are any indication, it's a tremendously popular program. The comments were full of supportive messages from students, including John, who said \"We are the Pioneers for a reason... That's right America...\" and \"We have a right to be proud of our climate leadership. It is accomplished through teamwork and collaboration, and benefits campus, community, county, state, nation, and world.\"This voting competition makes a strong argument that universities that invest in their sustainability programs get a lot of support from their students and alumni. Over 16,000 votes were cast for 19 schools during the competition, including over 2,000 for the runner-up, Allegheny College. The two schools traded first place several times, but the winner, William Paterson, finally ruled the day. Congratulations!"}, {"title": "Microsoft Taxes Itself to Go Carbon Neutral", "text": "This week, Microsoft is announcing an unusual initiative that it hopes will change how the company operates: an internal fee on carbon.Starting July 1 -- the beginning of the company's fiscal year 2013 -- the software giant will charge all of its 100-plus global offices and data centers a fee for every ton of carbon they produce (mostly from plugging into the electric grid, so-called \"indirect\" emissions). The money collected will go to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets, allowing Microsoft to declare itself carbon neutral.Although carbon neutrality is a claim that's gotten less credible over the last few years, Microsoft seems well aware of the challenge and is handling it well. Here's the problem with asserting neutrality: It's hard to ensure that any carbon reductions you're paying for -- from, say, capturing methane from a landfill or replacing inefficient cook stoves in Africa -- would not have happened anyway (this is the problem of \"additionality\").So to navigate this tricky terrain and make the most of its efforts, Microsoft is working with a handful of NGOs and a well-respected partner, Sterling Planet, which will buy the RECs and offsets.Interestingly, however, carbon neutrality doesn't seem to be the real point of Microsoft's initiative. From my conversations with the company, I take away four major reasons they're doing this:So how will Microsoft make this initiative a reality? The execution plan has some interesting elements (see a pithy white paper on the full carbon neutrality plan here). The company will measure carbon footprint in different operational buckets such as plug load (electricity used) and business travel, and then offset each category \"like for like\" (i.e., buying RECs for electricity and offsets for travel). The fees will vary as well; for example, the company will charge employees for all air travel on a per-mile basis, which raises awareness at the individual level.The program is smart, but I'm left with one major concern: Will the fees be high enough to change behavior? Right now, the market price of carbon is very low, so Microsoft is charging a small amount per ton. Even so, they will collect north of $10 million, which is enough to buy offsets. Over time, by my calculations, given the growth in cloud services the company is banking on, these carbon fees could rise to a more noticeable $50 million by 2020. But let's be honest: These numbers are clearly rounding errors to a company that netted $23 billion last year.To be fair, as the behavioral psychology gurus (from books like Nudge) will tell you, sometimes just making people aware of a cost is enough to foment change. So the minor nudge here may be good enough. But in the longer run, the price on carbon needs to be more of a sledgehammer than a nudge. It should reflect the full cost to society of health impacts, national security risks, and price volatility, all of which add up to tens of dollars per ton or more.Pricing carbon on your own, without a real market in place, is hard, which is why there are so few examples of companies doing it. Going back over a decade, BP put in place an internal carbon trading system that used a \"shadow\" price to encourage divisions to find the cheapest reduction opportunities (others like Shell have also used this tactic). But executives weren't charged real money. And more recently, athletic apparel company Puma (working with my colleagues at PwC and the UK's TruCost) produced an \"environmental P&L\" which measured the \"real\" cost of carbon and other environmental inputs like water. The company is exploring how to include the \"price\" in operations and give ownership to line managers; it currently says the metrics will \"inform operational decisions.\"So even with important experiments like these that have gone before, Microsoft's program is perhaps the first actual internal fee at this scale (my research isn't turning up anything exactly like this -- please send me examples if you have them!). It's innovative and committed, but it also points to a massive global failure of leadership on climate policy. We should put a price on carbon across the entire economy. But as Bernard says, \"While governments have an important role to play, we hope there's a benefit in us moving faster than the policy world.He's absolutely right. Companies cannot wait for the government wheels to turn to price and manage carbon -- the cost saving, risk reduction, and brand benefits of leading are too high.(This post first appeared at Harvard Business Online.)"}, {"title": "Voices Against Tar Sands: People on the Front Lines Speak Out", "text": "Washington\u2019s political wars rarely match reality back home. So when politicians and K Street lobbyists peddle the $7 billion Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, you can bet the red meat rhetoric about jobs and national security -- fanciful charges according to independent analysis -- is straight out of the game plan from DC\u2019s most popular blood sport; trolling for petro dollars.But outside the rarefied circles of Washington, voices of a different world hold sway, voices of people who care more about community health and their children\u2019s future than the Faustian bargains and false promises of Big Oil. These are voices of citizens from all walks of life -- grandmothers, housewives, ranchers, farmers, civic leaders -- willing to speak out about the growing threats of toxic tar sands oil in their lives. They are front line witnesses too often drowned out by the political din blaring from the monied corridors of the nation's Capitol.Check out NRDC\u2019s new website Voices Against Tar Sands that includes nearly a dozen people's stories about their fight against some of the most dangerous mining and pipeline projects in the world. Below, farm manager Julia Trigg Crawford, recently profiled in the New York Times, talks about her critical eminent domain case over the Keystone XL pipeline, which TransCanada wants to run through her property near Paris, TX.As my NRDC colleague Anthony Swift notes in his blog, these are the voices that really matter, people who give personal testimony to one of the greatest environmental threats we face today; the extraction of the dirtiest oil on earth.Extracting raw tar sands in Canada destroys forests and pollutes water on orders of magnitudes greater than conventional oil production. Its production and use emits significantly more toxins and carbon than conventional crude. Moreover, it presents potential risks to pipelines than safety standards haven\u2019t kept up with and when spilled, it is far more difficult to clean.These witnesses include Michigan residents and small business owners devastated by tar sands-polluted rivers; Nebraska farmers fighting to preserve the world\u2019s largest fresh water aquifer; Texas landowners battling TransCanada\u2019s 1,700 mile land grab; and minority neighbors located near massive tar sands refineries poised to spew more airborne poisons into their backyards.They are voices like that of Susan Connolly, a mother of two young children sickened by an Enbridge Energy pipeline that ruptured in July 2010, pouring a million gallons of heavy tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River, parts of which are still off limits to human contact and fishing today.\u201cI don\u2019t think the communities are aware of what is going to be occurring. They don\u2019t realize the severity of it and just how detrimental it can be to their communities... the only ones who are going to benefit are the pipeline companies. They talk about jobs and job growth. The only job growth for this pipeline that I have seen are for the workers that are cleaning up the spill.\u201dFour states away, people like Nebraska farmer Randy Thompson, recently profiled in Esquire magazine, have been battling TransCanada\u2019s plans to build the Keystone XL pipeline through the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills region and ship a daily torrent of 800,000 barrels of tar sands oil across critically important agricultural and drinking water supplies.\u201cWe have a foreign corporation here trying force their will on the American people and it\u2019s not right. There\u2019s no benefit to our country that I can see. We\u2019re an agricultural state, if we don\u2019t have water we\u2019re out of business... it doesn\u2019t do any good to complain to your neighbor across the fence. You need to make someone else hear your voice, someone that actually has the power to do something about it, that being our politicians, so we need to make the message loud and clear to them we\u2019re not happy with this project.\u201dPlayground in Port Arthur, TX, future destination for Keystone XL tar sands oil.Photo: Rocky Kistner/NRDCMeanwhile, in Texas, landowners are fighting a multi-year battle over the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, a plan to pump tars sands crude from the Cushing, OK, oil hub all the way to the massive petrochemical refineries of Houston and Port Arthur and then to the export market. They are the landowners who bear the risk and worry of tar sands spills near their homes and drinking water sources.They are voices like that of Eleanor Fairchild, a proud Texan whose husband once had been chief geologist with Hunt Oil. After he retired, the couple bought a house and property with a beautiful lake near Winnsboro, TX, a place her husband, now deceased, called \u201cheaven on earth.\u201d Now, Eleanor finds her land is threatened as she battles TransCanada over plans to run its Keystone XL tar sands pipeline straight through their slice of heaven.\u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t against the pipeline because I did realize what tar sands was... the more I learned the worse tar sands looks. They just wanted a place to put their pipelines down and to heck with the landowner... they just weren\u2019t very nice people when it came to what you wanted for your land... There should be laws that protect people from this type of treatment. We have to think of children and grandchildren and what we\u2019re doing to this earth. I think we need to leave this earth in as good a shape as we can for generations to come.\u201dWatch this video of Port Arthur resident Erma Lee Smith, who needs a \"breathing machine\" in her apartment next to the massive refineries of Port Arthur, TX.Meanwhile, at the end of the proposed 1,700 mile conduit of Canadian crude, the petrochemical Gulf community of Port Arthur lies waiting for a bigger toxic assault. This is where community activist Hilton Kelley, the 2011 recipient of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, has been battling refineries, long a source of hazardous waste and air emissions that locals blame on respiratory problems and cancers in their community. Kelley says residents do not need the added toxic assaults that tar sands oil will bring to his home.\u201cAll my life we\u2019ve lived in the shadows of refineries and chemical plants that are located here in our area... once that pipeline is built, all those jobs are gone that they said was going to bring so much wealth, those are not permanent jobs, and what we're going to get is a continuous flow of this tar sands that is heavy in mercury, heavy in metals and heavy in sulfur and what it\u2019s going to do is increase the negative air quality that we presently have.\u201dThese are but a few of the powerful voices from the front lines of the tar sands fight, voices that we will be adding to in the months ahead. They are from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, a multitude of races and communities from regions north to south. They all share a common bond; the health and safety of their families and their friends and neighbors, their cherished environments threatened by Canadian tar sands mining operations rapidly metastasizing through the boreal forests and pristine watersheds of northern Alberta. But this environmental carnage is just the beginning, part of a massive network of pipeline plans designed to pump millions more barrels of dirty tar sands oil toward U.S. refineries and the export market off North America's coasts.Watch and listen to the voices of people in its poisonous path. These are words well worth heeding, not the empty rhetoric of petrochemical companies trying to fatten their already profitable bottom lines. These are the people who speak from personal experience and observations in their own communities; they are the ones who speak from the heart."}, {"title": "Ten Most Endangered Rivers of 2012 (PHOTOS)", "text": "With Congress considering bills that would turn back the clock on 40 years of progress under the Clean Water Act, and rivers nationwide facing threats from natural gas drilling, pollution, and new dams, American Rivers today released its annual list of America's Most Endangered Rivers.American Rivers named the Potomac River, known as 'the nation's river' as it flows past our nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the most endangered in the country.

The tools we have today work extremely well in almost all settings, so we don't want people throwing their hands up in the air and saying this is a catastrophe,\" Robert Newman, the programme's director, told Reuters.\"But we have identified resistance, it is a problem out there, and we need to take urgent and concerted action to make sure we maintain the effectiveness of the tools.\"The WHO recommends four main classes of insecticides, the most common of which are pyrethroids. But resistance to at least one of these classes has now been detected in all regions where the disease is endemic.RESISTANCE SPREADSA study published last year found that mosquitoes in one region of Senegal swiftly developed resistance to bednets treated with deltamethrin, a pyrethroid.WHO director general Margaret Chan said the levels of resistance found in Africa and India were of greatest concern.\"These countries are characterised by high levels of malaria transmission and widespread reports of resistance,\" she said in a statement. In some places there was resistance to all four classes of insecticide.The WHO plan says each country at risk must analyse the extent of resistance and design a pre-emptive management strategy as part of its national malaria control effort, rather than waiting for resistance to increase.Experts estimate the cost of the global plan at more than $200 million a year, including research into insecticide resistance, research and development of new insecticides, and putting in place management strategies.\"We need to think of this as a long-term investment and look at what the costs would be if we did nothing,\" said Newman.WHO estimates that malaria costs the African economy alone $12 billion every year, a multiple of the annual $1.5 billion spent globally on the fight against malaria.\"If, for example, we were to lose pyrethroids and not be able to use them any more, then malaria control could become very expensive very quickly,\" Newman said.\"But if we buy ourselves many more years of being able to use them - by responding quickly when we find resistance and proactively putting in strategies to stop the emergence of resistance - then the overall price tag for malaria control ... is likely to be lower.\" (Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"}, {"title": "Beach Energy, Australia Natural Gas Company, To Sell Shale Gas Within A Year", "text": "By Rebekah KebedeADELAIDE, Australia, May 15 (Reuters) - Australia's Beach Energy may be ready to sell shale gas just a year from now if its pilot production wells are successful, the company's managing director said on Tuesday.Australia is in the midst of a gas boom, as developers build around $170 billion in projects that will make the country the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter before the end of the decade.The fuel for those projects is from conventional fields and coal seams, not from shale.Firms such as ConocoPhilips, Canada's PetroFrontier and Santos have been increasing their investment in the Australian shale gas sector, and the government has pointed to shale's future potential.But experts say the fledgling industry could take a decade to produce significant commercial volumes of gas. Beach Energy, one of the first companies to invest in shale gas, is aiming to do that much earlier.\"I am going to love proving them wrong,\" managing director Reginald Nelson told Reuters.The company's pilot wells are expected to start producing at the end of this year or early 2012, and within a year, Nelson said he expects the company could sell the gas into the domestic market. It would out the gas through the Moomba processing plant in South Australia, which is operated by Santos.Funnelling shale gas into longer term contracts, which usually range from 10 to 15 years in length, would likely to take a few more years, he said.\"In terms of locking in longer term contracts, you have to have the reserves booked and certified to be able to tie it up to a contract, so that might be a little later,\" Nelson said.U.S.-STYLE SHALE BOOM?Australia could have enough shale gas resources to double its gas resource base and its expand its growing export industry, according to a government report released earlier this week.The reserves, which are estimated at around 400 trillion cubic feet, have sparked hopes that a U.S.-style shale gas revolution is just around the corner in Australia.In the United States, which holds the second largest shale gas reserves after China according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, production converted the country from a big gas importer to a prospective exporter.Some analysts are sceptical the same will happen in Australia, as the industry faces many challenges, including high costs, environmental concerns and competition from alternative energy sources, including coal seam gas.\"It remains to be seen if Australia will have the same kind of world class shale gas assets as the U.S. does,\" Ross Millan, senior analyst at Woodmackenzie said.\"Shale gas will always be higher cost than coal seam gas and tight gas in Australia. Australia's coal seam gas assets are world class. So shale gas will never be able to beat that,\" Millan said.Coal seam gas has, however, sparked environmental concerns that could dog shale gas as well. Extraction of gas from shale requires large amounts of water and chemicals, which has led some governments worldwide to ban one of the extraction technique known as \"fracking.\"The average break even price for shale gas in Australia is around $6-$9 per mmBtu, according to some analyst estimates, two to three times the current domestic prices in eastern Australia.But domestic prices are expected to rise as more export projects come online, and the higher gas price will encourage more shale gas production, industry executives and analysts say.\"My intuition just tells me, if you've got a bunch of gas and you can unlock it at the right price, it's a good place to be,\" Nelson said.

Other operations on smaller fields have also been affected.The total loss in gas production from Elgin and nearby fields could cut British gas production by as much as 6 percent this summer, Britain's energy network operator has warned.Environmental impact from the leak has been minimal with fish and water samples from just outside a two-mile exclusion zone around the platform have not shown any signs of hydrocarbon contamination, the Scottish government said.Total has said it saw a possibility for production at Elgin to gradually restart later this year."}, {"title": "Living Planet Report 2012 From WWF Looks At Ecological State Of The Earth", "text": "Humans are currently using the equivalent of one and a half Earths to support our activities.

Global natural resource demand has doubled since 1966.Humans may be using 50 percent more resources than the Earth can provide, but resource demand in the U.S. is higher than much of the world. According to the 2012 report, the U.S. has the fifth highest ecological footprint per capita. In fact, if the entire world lived like Americans, the report claims, over four Earths-worth of resources and carbon absorption would be needed to meet our demands. (The four countries with larger ecological footprints are Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Denmark.)Colby Loucks, WWF's director of conservation science, explained that using the resources of one and a half planets is \"akin to buying on credit.\" He noted that by \"rapidly eating into our capital\" we continue to increase our \"ecological debt.\"Loucks stressed the importance of using resources more efficiently and protecting nature.

(MP3 Audio)Small wonder.For years, the oil and gas industry has adopted a war-like mentality towards its critics. When confronted with problems caused by drilling and fracking, instead of acknowledging them and working to prevent more, their approach has too often been to cover up the issues while attacking any critics who make problems known publicly.This pattern has sharply accelerated in recent months.Earlier this month, Al Armendariz, the EPA's regional administrator for the oil-and-gas rich states of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, sent his letter of resignation to Lisa Jackson, head of the EPA. Mr. Armendariz had come under heavy fire over comments he made two years ago at a local government meeting in Texas.In explaining his law enforcement philosophy, he analogized his agency's strategy to the early Romans, who he said would \"crucify\" law-breakers to make examples of them. After a video of these remarks was circulated last week by Sen. James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, who counts the oil and gas industry as one of his largest donors, a firestorm of controversy broke out.As Media Matters pointed out, when Mr. Armendariz said he intended to make an example of offenders, he was referring only to companies that actually broke the law -- but this was not enough to save his career.Despite high-profile incidences like these, many academics, reporters, environmentalists and public safety advocates have continued to press forward and conduct research to identify the sources of environmental contamination in their communities.When the oil and gas industry is at fault, these professionals have a responsibility to inform the public -- a responsibility that many take seriously, even knowing that they are confronting powerful interests. Fulfilling that responsibility has all too often cost them their privacy or their careers.These attacks have also stood in the way of an open and direct discussion of issues, distracted listeners from the real issues, and consumed the time of those targeted, and often spread misleading or false information.For example, after (then) Dish, Texas mayor Calvin Tillman arranged for air quality tests to be conducted in his town (home to dozens of compressor stations and pipeline junctions), he found himself dragged into lawsuits by natural gas companies and facing subpoenas and open records requests for his files.Mr. Tillman, who has since moved from the town because of his family\u2019s health problems, was able to successfully quash the first subpoena against him.The second time around, the same company, Range Resources, also hit a well-known blogger, Sharon Wilson, better known as Texas Sharon, with subpoenas ordering her to be deposed and to provide email exchanges with a long list of people, including many well-known activists and researchers.This time, Mr. Tillman responded. The Texan has now filed a formal ethics complaint with the state bar against two of the companies attorneys, alleging that the company abused the court\u2019s power, using it to go fishing for information unrelated to any pending case.\u201cIt is now my belief that this subpoena was not issued as a matter of necessity in this case, but rather this mechanism was used by Mr. Poole, and Mr. Okruhlik, as an intimidation and punishment tactic, due to my negative statements regarding the natural gas industry in general,\u201d wrote Mr. Tillman in a letter to the Texas bar association, describing his and Ms. Wilson\u2019s experiences with two of the company\u2019s attorneys.Within the scientific community, the blowback faced by researchers whose conclusions are considered harmful by the industry has been intense.One of the longest-standing controversies from drilling and fracking has centered on tiny Garfield County, Colorado, which was the most heavily drilled county in the state in 2007.That year, Judy Jordan, a newly-hired county geologist, Geoff Thyne, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines, and a graduate student, Tamee Albrecht, undertook a three-part study to determine where contamination in the county\u2019s aquifer had originated.In May, 2009, officials from the Colorado School of Mines threatened to fire Prof. Thyne, under pressure from the industry, causing him to leave the institution, according to Prof. Thyne.In 2010, amidst clear signs that the study would implicate Encana, a natural gas drilling company, Judy Jordan lost her job.The study itself? Never completed.Other academics have reported similar experiences.One of the industry\u2019s fiercest and most vocal critics in academia was Conrad Volz, Director of the Center for Healthy Environments and Communities at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.When reports began to emerge that the natural gas industry was disposing of its wastewater through treatment plants ill-equipped to handle the specific contaminants in the brine and frac water, Prof. Volz and a team from the University of Pittsburgh began to investigate.Last March, they reported their findings from testing the wastewater discharged by an industrial wastewater treatment plant in Pennsylvania, demonstrating that high levels of contaminants were hitting local rivers and streams, causing health concerns for local fishers, swimmers and others.Shortly after the report was distributed to the EPA, and local and state authorities, Prof. Volz came under enormous pressure to leave the University.In an April email to colleagues, he explained that he was not being forced out. However, I am leaving over what I perceive as a basic philosophical difference with the university as to the role of environmental public health advocacy and the practice of environmental public health in an academic setting,\u201d he wrote as he explained his resignation.When environmental organizations try to publicize problems, the drilling industry flexes its muscles, making it nearly impossible to get their message out. Signs questioning the impact of drilling are often deemed \u201ccontroversial\u201d in ways that ads touting the benefits of drilling are not.In Pennsylvania, a billboard depicting a jug full of contaminated water from a local well, captioned \u201cFix It\u201d was dismantled after only two days. In New Brunswick, the local power company was pressured by government officials to pull anti-fracking signs, and no other signs, down from utility poles.Anti-fracking activists have also described being questioned by law enforcement officials about their beliefs. For example, Adam Briggle, a professor of philosophy and bioethics, was visited by the FBI and questioned about his course syllabus and his participation in anti-fracking protests, based on an anonymous tip.And Pennsylvania awarded a $125,000 no-bid contract to a consulting firm, the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response, nominally to protect against terrorism threats. Instead, the firm issued bulletins alerting local law enforcement authorities about peaceful protests, anti-war organizing, and environmentalists concerned about fracking.Not only were there breathless -- but entirely unsubstantiated -- warnings that activists could target natural gas pipelines, but, most absurdly, the firm suggested that local authorities beware of a screening of Gasland.When the contract came to light, it was immediately cancelled -- but the damage has been done.Attacking the messenger may work in the short run. But as the oil and gas industry is starting to find out, these tactics come to light in the long run.As the list of those who\u2019ve come under fire grows, the industry further weakens its credibility. In the meantime, the underlying problems are ignored and grow worse."}, {"title": "Fracking States Losing Jobs And Revenue As Industry Shrinks", "text": "By Joan GrallaMay 14 (Reuters) - While Pennsylvania, northwestern Louisiana and gas-rich areas around the Gulf of Mexico are losing jobs and revenue as the fracking industry shrinks after a price collapse, oil-rich North Dakota and Texas are in the midst of a boom.Other winners in the fracking lottery include central and southern Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Wyoming, where the economy is expanding and revenues are climbing.As oil prices are expected to stay around $100 a barrel for at least a couple of years, the success of these states may last longer. But the high volatility of energy prices may give local economies a headache.With natural gas prices touching 10-year lows three weeks ago, there could be more pain ahead for gas-rich communities and states where fracking was until recently a growth industry.The forerunners in fracking natural gas are a case in point.Parts of northwestern Louisiana, where the Haynesville shale is located, already have been hit as gas rigs left. In Bossier City-Parish, one of the communities in the Haynesville area, the rural district tax revenue fell 25 percent to $2.5 million from January to April, according to tax administrator Ken Kirspel.Economists warn that this type of reduction in local revenues could spread throughout Lousiana as natural gas output falls, cutting more jobs and revenue.In the last two years, the oil and gas extraction industry added 36,000 jobs around the nation. Most of those jobs were in natural gas fracking, according to Dean Baker, an economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, D.C.Those jobs could move elsewhere, other experts said.Fracking is a drilling technique that extracts oil and gas from shale by blasting it with water, sand and chemicals. Environmentalists have raised concerns about possible air and water pollution. Due to these concerns, Vermont is set to ban fracking, and New York has placed a moratorium on it.How many jobs will be lost in gas production and gained in oil drilling is difficult to estimate, economists say, but local communities in gas-rich areas will feel the pain.The estimated number of jobs lost could reach 72,000 - or double the jobs added during the fracking boom, said Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. This assumes that each fracking job created one more job in related areas, such as trucking and steel manufacturing, and in other sectors, from hotels to shops, where oil and gas workers spend their wages.GOODBYE GAS, HELLO OILThe decline in gas rigs happened swiftly in Louisiana's gas-rich Haynesville shale. The number of rigs has dropped to about 40 from over 140 over the past 18 months, said Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.\"These rigs are moving to Texas or other places to drill wells ... for oil instead of natural gas,\" he said.Caddo Parish, which enjoyed the fracking boom, is getting squeezed now. Sales tax revenue fell 18 percent in 2011, and has kept slipping this year, said Erica Bryant, director of finance. \"We will have to monitor the situation to determine its effect on our operations.\"Some of the economic damage comes from the lost payments that landowners hoped to get from drilling companies.Suzanne Stinson, the court administrator for Bossier Parish, said a company that leased property from her family for three years has not renewed the contract.\"It didn't come as a surprise to us,\" she said, noting other landowners had the same experience.The metropolitan area around Shreveport, a Haynesville drilling hub, had 6,800 mining and logging workers in March 2012, down from a year-ago peak of 7,200, according to the Louisiana Workforce Commission.The state's severance tax, its natural resource levy, has yet to recover from the Great Recession. It only produced $764 million in 2011 versus a 2008 peak of $1.047 billion. The state's budget last year was about $25 billion.Natural gas drilling could remain depressed for a couple of years, economists say, because that is how long it could take to work off the oversupply created by fracking.The price of natural gas has fallen to about $2.50 per million British thermal units from around $13.70 in July 2008. Output fell in February, and the decline was the bigger of two monthly drops in 12 months..Drillers have reacted. The number of gas rigs fell last week to 598, the lowest in a decade. Yet the total number of oil rigs rose to 1,372, a 25-year high..Pennsylvania, which opened its doors to fracking, has started to see gas rigs leave the state. The number last week fell to 95 from 108 a year ago.\"I think Pennsylvania will see some moderation and there probably will be some short-term adverse effects on jobs,\" said Eric Smith, a professor at the Tulane Energy Institute, in New Orleans.The state, whose oil and gas revenue leaped to $419 million in 2011 from $176 million in 2006, could see that windfall shrink as more rigs leave, economists said To put that figure in perspective, the state's budget last year totaled $27 billion, with gambling alone producing $1.4 billion in 2011 tax revenues.NORTH DAKOTA'S OIL RUSHMany rigs have moved to North Dakota because of its oil-rich Bakken shale formation.Its mining and logging sector rose to 21,000 workers in March 2012 from 15,500 in December 2007, and its oil output topped California's in January. Economists expect more gains.North Dakota's oil production in January averaged 546,284 barrels a day and \"I think it's very realistic to assume this becomes a million barrels-a-day production,\" said John Harju, associate director for research at the University of North Dakota's Energy & Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks.The state's 3 percent jobless rate could fall further, and might even be lower in a few drilling hotbeds, like Williston.\"There's no unemployment here, everybody's home values have gone up, but at the same time, there is a lot more traffic,\" said Tom Rolfstad, the town's economic development director.North Dakota's oil tax revenue - which totaled $1.027 billion from July 1, 2011 to March 3, 2012 - is expected to keep rising. Its budget is about $4.2 billion.The state is aiding its booming localities, planning to send them about $1.2 billion by the time its two-year budget ends on June 30.\"They certainly have been our Big Brother through this whole thing ... but it is kind of hard to keep up,\" Rolfstad said."}, {"title": "R Street Institute, Heartland Insurance Spin-off, 'Will Not Promote Climate Skepticism'", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Heartland Institute's insurance research project, formerly the Center on Finance, Insurance and Real Estate, which on Friday announced its split from Heartland, \"will not promote climate change skepticism,\" according to Ray J.

Richard Lugar joins the ranks this month of his ousted moderate colleagues and predecessors, from former Sens. Chuck Hagel and Lincoln Chafee to former Reps. Wayne Gilchrest, Chris Shays and Sherwood Boehlert. Frankly, it is a little depressing. Wait, more than a little. A lot.   When I first came to Washington D.C., in 2006, I interned with Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest, who at the time represented Maryland's first district and its beautiful eastern shore.Despite having only ever voted for Democratic or Independent elected officials, I was so impressed with the congressman that I defended him publicly after Club for Growth went after Gilchrest with a $600,000 ad buy.Writing for a Hill newspaper, I suggested that Gilchrest was \"a veritable Lee Hamilton in terms of statesmanship and civility,\" and that \"this Maryland Republican's style harkens back to a Congress of yesteryear where contemplative conversation regarding state and foreign affairs was commonplace\".  This is true of Sen. Lugar as well. Both Lugar and Gilchrest stuck their necks out on countless measures, frequently risking much in order to encourage Congress to communicate with adversaries, not invade them, or to preserve the environment for the next generation by addressing climate change.Lugar and Gilchrest, furthermore, knew that sound domestic and foreign policymaking was not found in sound-bite rhetoric but thoughtful, deliberative dialogue with a vast variety of voters. Yet Congress is slowly losing the deliberative bearings to which it once belonged.To be clear, I am not simply suggesting that we need more bipartisanship. That is the wrong frame. What I am suggesting is that we be willing to approach each issue with nuance and contemplation, irrespective of party stance. This is why I have coauthored op-eds with members of Congress from both parties based on unique stances on specific issues. Whether it was my coauthor with Republican Congressman Bartlett on the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, my coauthor with Republican Congressman Gilchrest on fixing income inequality, or my coauthor with Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks on the Middle East peace process.All three of these aforementioned op-eds required courageous stands by each Member of Congress. It was not politically palatable within their parties to raise their voice on these issues in this way. But they did so anyway. Morals and principles guided them, not party platforms.This is what we need more of and I am concerned that with the tide of Super PACS beginning to swell we will see even less congressional decision-making based on moral compass and an increasing majority of decisions based on political premise and financial prowess. This heralds the death of deliberative democracy that represents the peopled majority. But perhaps it died a long time ago.

What's new about Map of Life is that it combines several sources of data that, at first glance, don't seem like they would fit well together. Range maps found in field guides, individual points from someone observing a species in a particular place, citizen science data, data gathered by national parks rangers and data gathered from larger regions all show up on the Map of Life. The map's creators gave the different kinds of data different shapes and colors, so users can distinguish between them even when they all show up on the map at once. Users can also add or remove one kind of data at a time.Knowing the distribution of species around the world will help scientists and government agencies decide how to use different pieces of land and focus conservation efforts, said Robert Guralnick, a biologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who worked on making the map. The map could provide data for studies about climate change and about diseases that are passed between animals and people.Right now, the tool people see at Mappinglife.org is still in beta testing. In the future, Map of Life users will be able add their own data to the map, Guralnick told Nature News. Future versions of the map will also include plants and some species without backbones. No matter what the mapmakers do, they'll only ever cover a fraction of the world's 1.3 million described species, not to speak of the millions that are yet undiscovered.Here's the most fun upcoming improvement: Map of Life's scientists want to make a smartphone app where users can see their odds of seeing a species, wherever they're standing in the world.Follow InnovationNewsDaily on Twitter @News_Innovation, or on Facebook.Copyright 2012 InnovationNewsDaily, a TechMediaNetwork company.

He talks about how the shallow-banked, slow moving river evokes personal memories of the Florida Everglades, and how if a foreign corporation were plotting to ram a toxic tar sands pipeline through the Everglades, the country would be, figuratively speaking, \"up in arms.\" He urges similar national concern for Nebraska's river treasures.Renewable Rider Tom Weis hears organic farmer Robert Bernt talk about how Keystone XL would threaten his family's livelihood by contaminating Nebraska's Cedar River. Robert, who describes the Ogallala Aquifer as \"one of the most precious natural resources that this country has,\" talks about his \"long, scary, unbelievable fight\" against Keystone XL and how TransCanada has divided Nebraskans with lies: they \"buy their way, force their way, threaten eminent domain...\" He provides a disturbing first-hand account of how he was \"ridiculed,\" \"humiliated\" and \"put down\" by Nebraska legislators at a public hearing on Keystone XL, giving the unmistakable appearance of politicians on the take. He describes TransCanada representatives openly mocking a member of the public at that same hearing, calling them \"ruthless\" and \"careless,\" with \"no concern for their fellow man...\"Renewable Rider Tom Weis rocket trikes down a section of the \"Cowboy Trail,\" a bike trail running 321 miles across northern Nebraska and following the old Chicago & Northwestern rail route.

The caveat: Each guest insists on picking one ingredient to include in the final dish, and your guests are from 193 different countries. This is what you all might come up with:It's clear after two weeks at the UN that negotiators for the Rio+20 Earth Summit on June 20-22 shouldn't quit their day jobs to become chefs. After splitting up the 200+ page document into two \"manageable\" chunks -- basically, the \"green economy\" and everything else -- and introducing a \"chairs selected text\" consolidating and removing repetitions, we then went back to line-by-line jockeying for inclusion of our favorite ingredients for success. The weeks of negotiation ended with one consensus: to meet one more week at the end of May.Each country's negotiators want to make their mark. The European Union wants to talk about roadmaps, the G77 has as many favorite dishes as countries, and many want to give more emphasis in the final document to food, oceans, education, and on and on. Unsurprisingly, the community is still fighting over what handful of sustainable development goals should rise to the top for adoption in Rio. Kazakhstan made waves when it tried to include an actual initiative in the single adopted outcome; the response was resounding: This is not the place for that.So I ask: Wouldn't a potluck suit the occasion much better? A smorgasbord of actions that bring the best each country has to offer? We all recognize that the world's changed a lot since 1992, and that's why the organizers have set aside several days prior to the big event in Rio to include other influencers. From the Global Town Hall to the Corporate Eco-Forum, we're living in a world of diverse tastes, capabilities and challenges.A potluck approach to Rio+20:For this bite at the Rio apple, how about a radically new approach: where we focus on the activities and actions that are actually happening...on the ground, affecting people's lives, and that don't have to be reiterated in a formal document to make them \"real\" somehow. NRDC has helped launch the Earth Summit Watch to bring to light these details. Some incredible changes are going on beneath our feet (just read how the G20 countries are leading on clean energy) and NRDC has called on numerous occasions for the creation of a global aggregator of sustainability commitments -- affectionately known as the \"cloud of commitments.\" This needs to be front-and-center if the Earth Summit is going to live up to its promise.The outcome document is part of what comes out of Rio -- and Kelly Rigg of GCCA has some tips for those scrambling to pull it together. But my generation will be living with the Earth Summit 2012 legacy for our most productive years -- and I don't think we need more paper.

I call it the puppy voice. In a pitch almost high enough that only dogs can hear it, my girls will say things like, \"That's so cute. Oh, look at that little baby. That is the cutest thing ever.\" I usually cringe and walk away while they exclaim over a cat video on YouTube. But the baby otter in Otter 501 is a helpless little piece of fuzz that needs rescuing and it actually could qualify as the cutest thing ever.In watching Otter 501, we learn a lot about otters, but for all the facts presented, the film isn't a documentary. It just feels like one and captures the northern California coastline beautifully. Otter 501 is the 501st otter rescued with the Sea Otter Research and Conservation program (SORAC). Through this program, otters are rescued, nurtured back to health, taught to survive in the wild and released. We learn about the program through Katie, a biology student taking some time off, until she discovers Otter 501 and a whole new world of opportunity opens up. I spoke with Katie Pofahl about her role in the film.\"I made the film and was part of the production team, doing on-camera work. Kind of consulting on scripting for my character's role.The thing that I think is so awesome about it is that these are documentarians to the core and they're going to try to make everything as close to reality as possible. In a sense, the animal's life in the film is straight documentary. My life is fictionalized because I never found an otter. You have to fudge a little bit to make the story compelling. In another sense, it's really true. I recognize that person on camera. I like her. The person I'm growing into and the person I want to be -- I see those elements in her.\"Katie tells the story of finding the baby otter through video Facebook updates. I wasn't sure if I liked this technique at first, but it turned out to be an effective way to show how the lives of the girl and the otter weave together. We follow the recovery of Otter 501 and the progress of Katie as she falls in love with the Monterey Bay area and marine biology. Katie filled me in on the film's social mission as well.\"We did a lot of our filming in Elkhorn Slough. It's a wetland, a marsh area. It's not what sea otters typically choose for their habitat. As the sea otters have repopulated the California coast, they've moved into this slough and done really well there. They release all the otters that have been reared at the aquarium there and it's a great place for them. Many of the wild otters choose to go there.Aside from the beautiful camera work, Otter 501 was a pleasure to watch. It brought together three elements that grab my attention -- animal shows, new use for social media and social action. By highlighting the plight of the sea otters, we learn about sea otters and their habitat, food, habits and needs. We also learn ways to help them. And finally, we have Katie making her direct address to the audience through her Facebook updates. It's a really interesting use of the different media. Check out the Otter 501 Facebook page for more on the film, personal updates from Katie and short videos.Otter 501 is being released in selected theaters on May 11th and will travel around the country hopefully coming to a theater near you. I'm imagining a whole theater filled with girls mock whispering, \"Oh my god, that is the cutest thing ever.\" Just see if you don't agree."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Runner's High -- Animal Rights Advocate Runs For The Cause", "text": "Compassion Over Killing's Jaya Bhumitra won't take animal abuse lying down. She's been getting up before dawn to train for the Palos Verdes half marathon this Saturday. Bhumitra is running 13.1 miles to raise money on behalf of the 9 billion animals killed annually for food in this country. She's also doing it in memory of her sister and, she says, \"to regain myself.\"Bhumitra began running in her teens and went meatless even earlier. \"I became a vegetarian at the age of nine -- the first in my family!\" In 2009, her growing concern about animal welfare made her switch from vegetarian to vegan. \"I wanted to get involved in animal activism in a more meaningful way, have a community of support around me.\" She began volunteering for COK in Los Angeles. \"I fell in love in with the organization, their approach in appealing to the mainstream, their creative campaigns.\"What really resonated for her was COK's message of empowerment. You don't have to wake up in the dark and run to show compassion for animals, \"you can do it with your fork\" -- by making the choice to go meatless.Through Bhumitra's work with the nonprofit, she met a terrific guy and they fell in love. It seemed like her whole life was moving forward in wonderful ways.Then Bhumitra's sister suffered a fatal accident at the end of 2009. Bhumitra was so devasted, her life came to a halt. She stopped doing the things which had given her pleasure, including running. She could only grieve.What saved her was her desire to save animals. \"I had this amazing, important cause. I found my purpose in animal advocacy.\"Last year, COK hired her to open their LA office and she and her terrific guy, Chris Locke, got married. This year, she was promoted to COK's campaigns manager and \"I'm finally ready to run again.\"She runs along the water, sometimes in the company of pelicans. \"It's exhilarating.\" Even at five in the morning. \"You see the sun rise, you have a head start on your day, you're more focused,\" she says. \"I find running very meditative.\"Saturday's half marathon gives Bhumitra an even bigger reason to run. She's running to raise $2,500 for COK, and hey, there's still time before the race to pledge.Training for the race has brought Bhumitra's attention back to what she eats. She's focusing more on plant-based whole foods like tempeh, which \"improve performance\" and provide the best fuel.\"I'm a huge fan of Chef AJ,\" she says. LA-based and plant-based, Chef AJ advocates whole foods, not processed foods. And no salt, sugar, oil, alcohol or coffee. We're talking hard-core. Instead of salt, Bhumitra's weakness, she's been ramping up the spice and lemon in her food, which add big flavor but no sodium.   \"I'm feeling great,\" she says. \"I have the opportunity to get back on track, to set a goal I feel so strongly about supporting.\"She also feels she's honoring her sister. \"She was an environmental and animal advocate. This gives me an opportunity to carry on her legacy,\" says Bhumitra.\"Animal advocacy and running are my biggest passions. To be able to combine the two is the ultimate dream for me.\" Bhumitra takes a deep breath. \"It feels really good to be back.\"Runner's High Mango Curry"}, {"title": "Mexico Wind Power Increases With Natural Tunnels, Farms Near La Ventosa", "text": "* Natural wind tunnel feeds electric grid* 26-storey turbines blossom across regionBy David Alire GarciaLA VENTOSA, Mexico, May 14 (Reuters) - On an arid plain where sudden gusts of wind can rip roofs off buildings and knock over tractor trailers, Mexico is building a new engine for its energy future.Surrounded by towering turbines in every direction, the town of La Ventosa - which means \"the windy place\" in Spanish - is at the heart of a wind power boom in the country.Mexico, the world's 14th biggest economy, still punches well below its weight in terms of wind energy, ranking 24th on the planet in installed capacity last year, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).But the market is growing fast. By the end of this year, the national wind energy association expects Mexico to jump to number 20 on the list, which is dominated by wealthy European nations, the United States, China and India.\"We're talking about the largest growth in wind power projects anywhere in the world,\" President Felipe Calderon said recently near La Ventosa at the opening of Latin America's largest wind park owned by Spanish company Acciona SA, a long row of turbines whirring behind him.Producing just 3 megawatts of wind power in 2005, Mexico now has nearly 400 times that, and will have 2 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2012, says the Mexican Wind Energy Association, or AMEE.Though it only accounts for a fraction of the 2011 global total of nearly 240 GW, by the beginning of next year, Mexico's installed wind power potential should equal almost 4 percent of the country's own energy needs.The planned build-up will make Mexico's wind industry the fastest growing in the Group of 20 economic powers this year, said Steve Sawyer, secretary general of the Brussels-based GWEC. He also said Mexico's net addition to installed capacity in 2012 could be the fifth highest of any country.Most of the increase will come from giant wind farms along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest point between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Eighteen of Mexico's 27 wind plants now operate around La Ventosa.Acciona says its $600 million project alone will be enough to power 700,000 Mexican homes, generating 306 MW of energy with 204 turbines. That investment will be followed later this year by an even bigger wind farm owned by the Macquarie Group's Mexico hedge fund, in partnership with Mitsubishi Corp and PGGM, a leading Dutch pension fund.By turning to wind, Mexico aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels that now power some 80 percent of electricity.\"It has the potential to transform how Mexico gets and uses energy,\" said V. John White, director of California's Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.AMEE President Leopoldo Rodriguez expects Mexico's total wind power supply to hit 4 GW by 2015, and go as high as 12 GW in 2020 - enough to cover about 15 percent of future energy needs. The United States, by comparison, aims to generate 20 percent of its electricity with wind by 2030.All told, the government estimates Mexico's total wind power potential at 71 GW - a figure well beyond the 51 GW of installed energy capacity in Latin America's No. 2 economy last year.NATURAL WIND TUNNELThe difference in temperature between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean in the southern state of Oaxaca creates one of the planet's strongest wind tunnels as gusts tear through gaps in the Sierra Madre mountains.\"When the wind blows hard here, buses fall over and entire trees are uprooted,\" said La Ventosa shopkeeper Miriam Luis.At the other end of the country, Mexico will begin its first-ever wind power exports next year to San Diego, California from a giant farm in the Baja California peninsula.The government is giving incentives to companies to use wind energy and Cemex, one of the world's largest cement makers, bread maker Grupo Bimbo, the Mexican arm of Wal-Mart, and mining company Penoles are among the corporations signing up.The Federal Electricity Commission, or CFC, offers companies a discount on electricity prices if they sign long-term power contracts with wind farms. As a result, the CFC is able to seek international financing at attractive rates to improve transmission infrastructure and promote the boom.Some firms take advantage of government tax breaks to build the farms themselves and others simply buy the energy from wind plants already being built, mainly by Spanish developers.Under the government's scheme, companies get credit for feeding the national grid with extra electricity they don't use, leading to savings up to 10 percent on their electricity bills.Investors can also make good money from wind projects in emerging markets such as Mexico, said Rupesh Madlani, head of clean technology research at Barclays Capital.Rates of return in Mexico are \"comfortably over 10 percent\" compared with 8 percent for western Europe, and 10 percent for many developing nations, Madlani said.OPPOSITIONCalderon, a conservative, has won praise for his environmental policies but he cannot seek a second term at a presidential election in July so it will be up to his successor to advance his green plans in the world's no. 7 oil producer.In a sign of continuity, Congress recently passed a climate change law mandating that more than a third of Mexico's energy will come from renewable sources in 15 years. The law would lead to a 12 percent drop in absolute emissions from 2005 levels by 2020, according to a research note by HSBC.Renewable energy, including hydropower and solar, generates more than a fifth of Mexico's electricity. The government also plans to build new dams and install more solar panels.But the towering wind parks, and the foreign developers behind them, are not entirely welcome in Oaxaca.Activists complain that locals only see a small share of benefits from projects that have cluttered the isthmus with hulking turbines. Indigenous groups in Oaxaca say that small farmers have been duped into leasing their land below market rates to make way for the rapid expansion.The turbines, some 26-stories high, have dramatically changed southern Mexico's picturesque mountains and coastline.Hundreds of acres of corn, bean and sorghum fields have been rented out to wind companies for existing farms or ones under construction.Some residents complain they were not properly informed beforehand about the scale of the development and now either want more money from the big companies or want them gone.\"For us, the wind isn't just a resource, it's part of our life from nature that shouldn't be sold,\" said activist Bettina Cruz, a native Zapotec speaker. She was briefly arrested this year for organizing noisy protests to block the wind farms.In most lease agreements, companies pay for the \"right to wind\" and allow farmers access to their land even if it falls within the park's boundaries.Opponents say they are often arbitrarily fenced out of their land in violation of the agreements and that irrigation canals and fields have been destroyed during construction.The projects mostly create temporary jobs, not permanent employment, meaning the impact on long-term economic development is limited in Oaxaca, one of Mexico's poorest states.The companies counter that the lease agreements are fair and can provide an extra source of income to poor farmers.Under \"right to wind\" leases, landowners on Acciona's wind park receive some 14,000 pesos ($1,000) a year - nearly half an average annual salary in the area - per 2.5 acres (1 hectare), said Amado Marin, head of a local farmers' cooperative. They can get even more if their plot is host to a turbine or a road.With every new turbine, though, subsistence farming practices that date back centuries are slowly disappearing.\"Farmers are not planting anymore. You don't see the typical local fruit as much. The corn that used to be planted everywhere, is gone,\" said Javier Valvivieso, a highway worker in La Ventosa. \"Instead, it's the wind business.\""}, {"title": "Springfield Coal Fossil Forest Is Largest Ever Discovered (PHOTOS)", "text": "Deep beneath southern Illinois, scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 307 million-year-old forest that could \"shed new light\" on modern climate change, reported The New York Times.Located between 250 and 800 feet underground, the forest is buried within the coal seams of a region that has seen a resurgence in mining in recent years. The find has been called the \"largest fossil forest ever discovered,\" by Paleontologist Dr Howard Falcon-Lang, reports Sky News.The New York Times explains that, within the coal mines, the forest can only be viewed from above. The forest once grew on peat, which became coal. \"When that was excavated, the forest\u2019s fossilized remains could be seen in the mine\u2019s shale ceiling.\"William A. DiMichele, a Smithsonian Institution paleobiologist who helped discover the forest, told the paper, \u201cIt's a botanical Pompeii, buried in a geological instant.\" DiMichele and the other researchers believe that the variety of plant species and the \"ancient geography\" found within the coal mines will allow them to \"undertake ecosystem-wide analyses\" and better understand the impacts of climate change as a result of rising CO2 levels.Several years ago, DiMichele, Falcon-Lang and others discovered a similar fossil forest in eastern Illinois coal. Noting that \"plant fossils are not uncommon in Illinois coal mines,\" the Illinois State Geological Survey explains that the earlier Herrin coal seam find stood out for its numerous fossils and \"excellent preservation.\"The ancient forests in Illinois aren't the only recent discoveries within coal mines. Earlier this year, a 298-million-year-old forest was found beneath a mine in northern China. Unlike the fossilized Illinois discovery, the Chinese peat forest was preserved by ash from a volcanic eruption.In February 2011, a coal miner found a fossilized shark jawbone within a mine in central Kentucky.

As a broadcast news journalist turned green radio activist, I am dismayed by these ominous tidings. As a mother, I am outraged, and you should be too.Whether or not you have a child, grandchild, nieces or nephews in this world, you should know there is an all-out war underway to harm their future and the future of all life on the planet. If that sounds apocalyptic, well, it is, according to James Hansen, NASA's top climate scientist. Dr. Hansen recently wrote a gripping op-ed piece about the Keystone pipeline signaling \"game over\" for our climate. If presidential approval is given to allow oil to be extracted from Canadian tar sands and piped down to Texas oil refineries, the energy intensive extraction process will release enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to help move us into the danger zone. As you might guess, Hansen means \"game over\" not in any sports context but in terms of the ultimate American challenge: Will we do what is necessary to avert climactic disaster for generations to come? This reality is unfolding now but the drama will not be broadcast on any station near you: Our planet's fate is a little TOO real for prime time.Those of us watching the planet's ecological emergencies grow exponentially more serious -- and working to help change our course -- are accustomed to this type of daily doomsday commentary from the experts. We only wish it were not true, but we know better. If you've been living under a rock, somehow missing reports of all the record weather events -- and ensuing death, damage and destruction -- you should start subscribing to Climate Progress or The Daily Climate and you too, will soon wake up and smell the carbon.The events that sparked the ire of many are so disgusting and discouraging as to give me pause in committing to this work of eco-consciousness raising. It is now painfully clear that our biggest obstacle is not just a matter of informing a distracted multitasking public about our environmental urgencies -- a daunting enough challenge since the clock is ticking. A far darker monster has raised its ugly head and it's growing more legs everyday. First the ultraconservative Heartland Institute posted a Chicago billboard equating climate change believers with extremists like Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. It was taken down after an outpouring of outrage, but that trial balloon was enough to burst my bubble in not believing fossil fuel funded deniers were that evil -- misguided, yes, but evil no. Actually, unequivocally, yes, given what happened later in the week.As seeming proof of the effectiveness of the lobbyist's disinformation campaigns, on Tuesday came word from Stanford researcher, Jon Krosnick, Ph.D., that public support for curbing climate change has slipped significantly in the past two years, particularly among Republicans. Support for various steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions has dropped an average of ten percentage points since 2010 from 72 percent to 62 percent, according to Krosnick, who notes that most of the 62 percent \"hate the idea of consumer taxes to do it.\" If that sounds like public opinion influenced by radically \"conservative\" politicians, libertarians and right wing media, you guessed... right. While nobody loves to pay taxes, given the scope of the planetary emergency posed by climate extremes, it will take attacking the problem on all fronts. It must include voting for eco-savvy leadership to help Americans understand the need for all of us to contribute to the solution, and not just monetarily. Why not start diverting a fraction of the millions going to military purposes to address the war on warming? Simply put, not doing so will doom us, and mostly our offspring.But back to the research and on to the real outrage. As if it's not disturbing enough that during a period of unprecedented changes in the atmosphere, oceans and the world's disappearing rainforests, public opinion has gone in exactly the wrong direction (and for that you can thank the DIC, or \"Denial Industrial Complex,\" according to Joe Romm of Climate Progress). While the right wing controls 95 percent of talk radio and shows on the Fox network continue to dismiss climate change as a hoax, too many busy Americans are not tuning in to their environment, our life support system. That trend - just as Mother Nature appears to be trying to tell us something -- is reason enough to despair, for those of us who know what it portends. However, the other development is the one that put this mother over the top.On Tuesday the  Guardian reported that \"a network of ultra-conservative groups is ramping up an offensive on multiple fronts to turn the American public against wind farms and Barack Obama's energy agenda.\" The article goes on to report that \"a number of right wing organizations, including Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, are attacking Obama for his support of solar and wind power. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which also has financial links to the Kochs, has drafted bills to overturn state laws promoting wind energy.\" There is more, including mention of a new loose coalition of fossil fuel industry interests linked to -- you guessed it -- the Koch brothers.There are no words for just how outrageous, sinister, greedy and evil these efforts and people are -- proof positive they will stop at nothing to destroy the future to protect their own short term interests (to hear what happened when we found words to describe this atrocity, and hear from Peter Kelley of the American Wind Energy Association, check out this week's show at thegreenfront.com).And as if the cognitive dissonance was not making my head scream enough, to put a point on all this madness, Friday came word that Saudi Arabia is unveiling a $100 billion plan to make solar \"a driver for domestic energy for years to come.\" So even the world's largest producer of oil understands the value of developing renewable energy (while America's fossil fools declare war on it). This coming a few months after Saudi Arabia's oil minister called global warming \"among humanity's most pressing concerns.\" It looks as though we'll continue to be energy dependent on Saudi Arabia in the future. While they bask in the sunshine they'll be happy to sell us their oil, thereby increasing our debt and further decreasing our chances of a stable ecology and robust economy.On the positive side, Thursday brought good news from Progressive Democrats Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Keith Ellison (D-MN). They unveiled a bill to end subsidies to the oil, coal and natural gas industries. The bad news is that the bill reportedly doesn't stand a chance in hell of passing.So, on this Mother's Day, falling as always just weeks after Earth Day, I ask all of you mothers (and others) out there, just how much do you love your kids? What about your country and planet? Enough to stand up and let your voices be heard, to take a break from the daily activities to take some action? I, for one, am \"steamed\" enough to consider launching a Green Tea Party to raise the volume on the outrage more Americans would feel if they truly understood what was at stake. While Tea Partiers -- all of whom have proudly declared that climate change is not a problem -- were angry about high taxes, we should be angry about high (greenhouse) gases! Why?Because -- like it or not, America -- we are in hot water and before we reach the boiling point, we should 'steep' ourselves in science, infuse ourselves with information, and together come up with a solution that will ensure we do not damn our children, and theirs, to a future too hot to handle.Happy Mothers Day and if you want to make my day, email me at betsy@thegreenfront.com and tell me \"you are in\" on a Green Tea Party.

Their population is currently estimated to be around 20,000. They are up to 46 feet (14 meters) long and weigh up to 99,000 pounds (45,000 kilograms).While scientists have known that commercial whaling decreased whale populations, the specifics of the population prior to whaling has been uncertain. To get a better understanding of the pre-whaling numbers for one subspecies of gray whale, the researchers used DNA samples from the bones of eastern Pacific gray whales that lived between 150 and 2,500 years ago and compared the results with the genomes of modern whales.\"In this case, we were able to look at pre-whaling specimens of gray whales, and found that the genetic data are consistent with a sharp and recent bottleneck \u2014 very likely the result of commercial whaling,\" study researcher Elizabeth Alter, of City University of New York, York College, said in a statement.They saw that the older whales, from before the advent of commercial whaling, had much more variation within their genomes than today's whales. This means that at the time, the whale population was much larger.This genetic data on those whales suggests their population used to be much larger than their current numbers, probably around 78,000 to 116,000. These estimates were at odds with historical records of whale populations, the researchers said, which had suggested that there were somewhere between 15,000 and 35,500 whales at that time.Their new study supports the previous genetic work, which focused on only current whale populations and suggested their numbers were much larger even as little as 200 years ago.\"Retrieving DNA from ancient whales allows more direct insights into their population histories than using modern DNA alone,\" Alter said. \"As methods for retrieval and analysis of ancient DNA improve, we'll be able to increasingly refine population histories for heavily exploited species like whales.\"The results were published May 9 in the journal PLoS ONE.You can follow LiveScience staff writer Jennifer Welsh on Twitter, on Google+ or on Facebook.

Senator Paul responded and implied that it was I, in fact, who was misleading the public.It is always interesting and sometimes productive to debate with people of differing political views. In this case, Senator Paul provided all the information needed to make an informed decision on this issue by including the 11th Circuit Court decision on the case at hand. I strongly urge anyone to read the case as it lays out the facts, the law, and the circumstances better than I ever could.Anyone who listened to Senator Paul's testimony at the hearings would have difficulty reconciling them with the facts of the case. The evidence clearly shows that not only did the fishermen run a large and complex operation, but they were well aware that they were harvesting millions and millions of dollars' worth of lobsters they were not supposed to catch.The court makes it clear that restrictions on which lobsters can be caught are not trivial. Those restrictions are in place so that immature lobsters, or others that are about to reproduce, are protected. This is a textbook example of where the Lacey Act was rightly applied to protect the future of an industry by preventing exploitation today.A jury in Alabama and two federal courts found the defendants guilty in this case. They had all of the protections of the American court system, and their convictions have been upheld. As can be the case where other nations' laws come into play, especially when millions of dollars, prison time, and lots of lawyers are involved, this can be complex. Complexity, however, does not mean that there was injustice.The United States also has fishing laws, as well as laws to protect our other limited and precious natural resources. I suspect that if foreign fishermen smuggled 400,000 pounds of Maine lobsters or illegally harvested wood from Oregon, worth millions of dollars, from our country, that Senator Paul and I would want them brought to justice, even if, especially if, they fled our jurisdiction. Laws such as the Lacey Act exist to protect the future of our industry and our environment."}, {"title": "How to Make Population Growth Reverse Itself", "text": "Most people seem to think that to reverse population you'd need violence, epidemics, or forced sterilization. Actually, you need literacy; read on. Many other people think technology will save us.Probably the greatest technological advance ever implemented to ease the likelihood of population-induced starvation was the Green Revolution. Engineered to end hunger, the Green Revolution failed because most of the world allowed the increased food to grow more hungry people than ever. China, partly because of its one-child policy, has eased more hunger, faster, than anyplace ever has. Meanwhile, India's population growth largely erased its food-production increases. Now, a record 1 billion people suffer malnutrition; 10 million more each year. A recent U.N. report titled \"The State of Food Insecurity\" came with a press release stating, \"For millions of people, eating the minimum amount of food to live an active and healthy life is a distant dream.\"Land, water, population growth -- violence. When Rwanda's population tripled between 1950 and the early 1990s, it became Africa's most densely populated country. Farmland and food -- and tempers -- grew short. And in the ethnic rampage that killed 800,000 in 10 days, whole families were hacked to death lest there be survivors to claim the family farm-plot. Sudan's Darfur genocide was also ignited by disputes over farmland, exacerbated by drought. Sudan's population, about 10 million in 1950, is projected to hit 70 million by 2050. If it does, Sudan will likely fight a newly doubled 120 million Egyptians for Nile water -- unless Ethiopia, having more than doubled to 80-plus million, tries diverting the 85 percent of the Nile headwaters it controls.Poor people don't want to stay poor. But there's a misconception that it's somehow \"unfair\" to poor people to let them in on the main secret of wealthy, educated, and successful people: smaller families mean larger lives.The thing that brings fertility down fastest happens to be the same thing that brings down poverty: educating girls. Turns out, illiterate women bear three times as many children as literate women, and their children tend to stay poor. Meanwhile, each year of schooling raises earning power 10 to 20 percent. And when people are a little better off, they desire fewer children.Good news: Things are getting worse at a slower rate; the rate of population increase is easing. More than 40 countries now have populations that are stable or slowly declining, including Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan. At present trends, the world population will likely peak around mid-century (at between 8 and 11 billion). By then, something like 50 countries will likely already have fewer people than today. People can live crowded and in fear. But real human beings will always need soil, water, food, wood, air, beauty, freedom from oppression, freedom of expression, room for compassion, the company of creatures, and a future.When the ship Titanic set out to cross the ocean, its proprietors believed it indestructible. So they did not equip it with enough lifeboats for all the people on board. History is sometimes destiny. Believing ourselves too clever to sink our enterprise, we're on another voyage where lifeboat room is limited. And we're discovering there are more passengers than the mothership was built to handle. No known island exists, no opposite shore, no passing ships to call to for rescue. Just us. Just us, and the wish -- perhaps too late -- that we had steered a more careful course while the band gaily played.As we bravely enter the new time of the Anthropocene and the uncertainties of a world with us at the helm, it's worth reconsidering Thoreau's declaration, \"In wildness is the preservation of the world.\" Wild places produced the living world and its inhabitants in abundance and resilience.On the other hand, let's not forget that for most of human history, natural things stood poised to recycle us at any moment. Weather, beasts, famine, enemies. We can live safer and better by enjoying those elements that have come under control -- agriculture, medicine. I wouldn't recommend a \"return to nature.\" I like books and science. I like music. I am willing to abandon the concept of Nature. I'm willing to abandon it -- for any approach that works better.Nature is moot, anyway, because we've so thoroughly changed the world. As oceans get depleted, water tables drop, sea levels rise, and forests fall, you begin to realize that the draw-down of \"nature\" is just one side of a coin on which hundreds of millions of people face a world wherein likelihood of dignity -- always so elusive throughout history -- now drains away with the fresh water; hope flies away like the birds that no longer return.If, to paraphrase Aldo Leopold's dictum, \"a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty\" of the living community, then we've passed \"right\" traveling in the opposite lane. If our values change, we might use science and technology to save us. If our failed values persist, science and technology will only press our accelerator.Adapted from: The View From Lazy Point; A Natural Year In An Unnatural World, by Carl Safina, published by Henry Holt (Hard cover) and Picador (paperback, 2012); winner of the Orion Book Award.All photos by Carl Safina.Sources: Africa populations, relation to Nile water, and population projections and tensions, also Rwanda: Brown, L, 2008, Plan B 3.0, Norton, New York and London, p 117-119.

The series chronicles flat-out lies by chemical industry witnesses before state legislatures and deliberate misrepresentation of science, all in service of a successful campaign to avoid government and public oversight. Sound familiar? It's the Big Tobacco playbook. In fact, many of the tactics, including faking the story of dead baby (I kid you not) would even make a tobacco lobbyist blush.Today's story focuses on the ongoing policy failures that allow these deceptive practices to continue unchecked, especially the Toxic Substances Control Act. It also chronicles how the industry has not only blocked reform in Congress, but has successfully influenced the White House to block the limited reforms that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has attempted.The fabrications, front groups, deliberate distortions of science, and political bullying documented in the stories have been sustained over years and across the country. They are not isolated incidents. (In fact the article left out some particularly ugly battles in Maine and Maryland.) Similarly, the companies the Tribune implicates are not on the periphery of the industry, but in its mainstream, playing major roles in the American Chemistry Council. Until this year, Albemarle's CEO even chaired the ACC board committee that set strategy for federal policy on chemical safety.Our current chemical safety policy amounts to an honor system and it's now perfectly clear that too many of these companies simply have no honor. It is past time for Congress to pass the Safe Chemicals Act by Senator Lautenberg, which addresses every major failure of current policy: the lack of independent health and safety information about most chemicals, excessive secrecy, and the lack of action on even the most notorious chemicals.It is also past time for the White House to stop blocking the more limited reforms that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has proposed. The story of how the White House has stymied Jackson hasn't been told very much but it is quite tragic. Jackson's efforts are restrained by the limits of current law, nevertheless, they have all been small, sensible moves toward greater scrutiny of the chemicals that end up in our homes and too often in our bodies. Her most recent proposal would reveal health and safety information that has been kept secret under an abuse of the current law. The White House should approve it without delay so that the public can better evaluate the dangers from chemicals. This is something they can do about the problem that doesn't require cooperation from Congress.In the meantime, please take a moment to read the Tribune series.

Asthma. Cancer. Emphysema\" -- masks marked with conditions often attributed to coal were scattered among the faces of a Portland, Ore., crowd on Monday.On stage, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke against the export of Montana and Wyoming coal through six proposed ports in Oregon and Washington.\"They are not coming here to bring you prosperity and jobs,\" Kennedy, president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, told the 400-plus rally attendees. \"They're coming to ship their poison, so that they can poison the people in China, and that poison is going to come back here and poison your salmon and your children. So don't let it happen.\"As The Huffington Post reported in November, before the coal ever starts its voyage across the Pacific, mile and a half long trains must first carry it through dozens of Western communities, including the cities of Spokane and Seattle, along a northwest route that originates in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming. There, the combustible rock would be strip-mined, triggering a cascade of local, national and global health and environmental consequences.Opposition to the ports is mounting. The rally in Portland is the latest of a string of protests and pleas that emphasize the potential public health fallout should the projects move forward. In a letter on Tuesday, the Washington State Department of Ecology urged that the cumulative effects of all the ports be studied. Oregon's governor asked the federal government in April to address how increasing exports to China and other Asian counties will \"fit with the larger strategy of moving to a lower carbon future,\" reported The Oregonian.Experts now estimate that the influence on climate change of the combined coal proposals would exceed that of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline.\"The scale of these proposals is unprecedented,\" Eric de Place, senior researcher at Seattle-based Sightline Institute, an environmental think tank, said during a press call on Thursday. Running at full capacity, he noted, the six proposed ports could send around 150 million tons of coal to Asia, far more than the entire U.S. shipped abroad last year.Some of the most immediate and tangible effects would be felt by the communities along the rail corridor. Cheney, Wash., Mayor Tom Trulove said during the press call that more than 60 trains could soon be \"tooting and rumbling\" through his city every day.In addition to the noise pollution, which researchers suggest can raise risks of everything from heart disease to cognitive impairments in kids, Trulove is also concerned about slower emergency response times for fire trucks, ambulances and police that need to traverse the five railroad crossings in town.He admits that he hasn't even given much thought to coal dust that might blow off each train car during its journey, nor has he really considered the diesel particles pumped into the air by both the trains and ocean-going tankers.Exposure to coal dust, which can include toxic heavy metals such as mercury and lead, has been associated with greater risks of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as reduced memory, motor skills and attention spans in children. Meanwhile, diesel pollution poses another set of risks: respiratory problems, heart disease and cancer.\"One of the most disturbing issues is that diesel particulate matter has been shown to cause abnormal lung development in kids,\" Dr. Frank James, a private practice physician in Bellingham, Wash., told The Huffington Post. \"And kids that live near the train lines are going to be disproportionately affected. These are mostly poor children, the least able to get the resources to deal with asthma and other problems.\"Once the coal sets out to sea, the danger of an oil spill also comes into play, as The Huffington Post reported last month. Research also suggests that mercury and other pollutants resulting from Asia's eventual burning of the coal would come back to haunt the U.S. west coast.Chinese activists have their own concerns.As The Oregonian reported, Hao Xin of the Qiantang River Waterkeeper in China told the Portland crowd that lower domestic demand is prompting U.S. coal companies to look overseas for new markets for their product. (The last coal-burning power plants in Oregon and Washington are scheduled to shut down, in 2020 and 2025, respectively.)\"China should not become the dumping ground for your coal industry,\" he said. \"We Chinese people need clean air, clean water.\""}, {"title": "Adventurers And Scientists For Conservation Project: Roadkill Data Gathered By Cyclists", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon:The open road is a dangerous place, especially if you're not in a car. But thanks to a new \"road ecology\" project, people who defy these dangers on bicycles and on foot are uniting to help their carless counterparts in the animal kingdom, who often bear an added burden of not quite grasping the risks.Led by Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation, the project seizes on the recent trend of citizen science, crowd-sourcing roadkill data from volunteers worldwide. While anyone can report a sighting \u2014 including people in cars \u2014 ASC executive director Gregg Treinish says cyclists and pedestrians have a unique appreciation for animals' vulnerability on roads, which many motorists treat as single-purpose car corridors.\"It's a scary prospect while you're road biking that you could get hit by a car,\" Treinish says. \"And it happens. Maybe not as often as with wildlife, but it does happen.\"By amassing so much data, researchers hope to learn which species are most affected by road traffic, as well as when, where and how often they're hit. This would not only reveal threats to individual species and populations, but may also identify potential \"roadkill hotspots.\" If there are places where traffic is unusually deadly to animals, more data might build support for tackling the problem, whether by adding animal-crossing signs, building wildlife overpasses or simply lowering speed limits.The ASC's Roadkill Survey expands on two smaller, state-level projects set up in California and Maine over the past three years, both developed by the University of California-Davis' Road Ecology Center. The REC opened in 2003 to study \"the impact of roads on natural landscapes and human communities,\" and it's now working with the ASC to let citizen scientists \"collect data anywhere there are roads,\" Treinish says.It's also easy to report the data, thanks to an online form and a smartphone app designed by iNaturalist. Photos help, but they aren't necessary \u2014 organizers mainly want basic details about the animal, location and time. The ability to collect this kind of data so quickly and on such a large scale is a big deal, says UC-Davis ecologist and REC director Fraser Shilling, because it's paving the way for an unprecedented cache of information about wildlife, both living and dead.\"There are two stories here,\" Shilling says. \"One is understanding what causes roadkill, where there might be more roadkill than other places, and where we can start doing something about it. The other story is that there are no large-scale wildlife observation systems in the world, no standardized protocols. This is that system, taking people's observations and mapping them out over space and time. If we do this over years and years, we can learn really important stuff.\"The global survey is still in its early stages, but local research has already shed some light on roadkill in recent years, Shilling adds. The busiest highways have low roadkill rates because animals rarely try to cross, while urban roads are generally clear due to sparser wildlife in cities. Most roadkill occurs on \"less busy, but still high-speed, rural highways and roads,\" Shilling says, adding that curvy roads are worse.Raccoons were the most common roadkill in California last year with 1,693 reported, followed by striped skunks (1,372), ground squirrels (845), opossums (763) and mule deer (761). The top casualties in Maine were eastern gray squirrels (503), porcupines (447), raccoons (266), striped skunks (214) and wild turkeys (212). Nationwide, the REC estimates there are up to 2 million animal-vehicle collisions every year. And these aren't just bad for wildlife \u2014 striking big animals like deer can also hurt motorists, and Shilling points out many crashes occur when drivers swerve to dodge a collision.Manmade wildlife overpasses can help some animals avoid roads, from common varieties like raccoons and white-tailed deer to endangered species like a recently spotted Canadian lynx. Walls and fences may also work, but in general, Shilling is skeptical that building new infrastructure will make a dent in roadkill rates.\"There's roadkill everywhere,\" he says. \"There are very few hotspots. Hotspots are a convenient fantasy for conservation planners. They make it seem like you can solve the problem by building overpasses, but it's really a much broader problem about human behavior.\" No certain type of vehicle stands out as a top roadkill culprit, although most cars, trucks and SUVs that hit animals do have one thing in common, he adds: \"The type of car that's most likely to cause roadkill is a fast-moving one.\"Speed is often the deciding factor in all kinds of traffic accidents, and wildlife collisions are no different. Shilling doesn't entirely dismiss building overpasses, but he says focusing on driving habits instead would be more effective and produce broader benefits: \"There are places in the world with speed limits for wildlife. When we have people driving 75 or 80 mph through the Sierra Nevada, we're going to be losing wildlife. If we want to protect wildlife, we need to address the problem.\"And the first step in addressing a problem is understanding it \u2014 something that's much easier now with citizen scientists pitching in. \"I still have an old box of roadkill observations that a fish and game biologist was recording, and it's all hard copy,\" Shilling says. \"It's great data, but it's sitting in a box. It's really hard to share it, and a system like this makes it easy to standardize the reporting and share the data.\""}, {"title": "Aftermath Of 7 Natural Disasters As Seen From Space (PHOTOS)", "text": "Here are before-and-after images from 7 natural disasters on Earth captured from space.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "The Koch-Stone XL Pipeline", "text": "Two pieces of crucial evidence emerged in the tar sands fight yesterday. One, happily, got all kinds of notice -- Jim Hansen's op-ed in the New York Times was the \"most emailed\" item of the day, which is appropriate since he explained new calculations showing that those Canadian deposits contain \"twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by global oil use in our entire history.\" If we burn them on top of all the coal and oil and gas we're already using, \"concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eventually would reach levels higher than in the Pliocene era,\" the government's leading climate scientist explained, which you think would be enough to end the debate -- even in our weird political culture, there aren't many leaders clamoring to return us to the Pliocene.But the debate continues -- in fact, House leaders are busily trying to fasten automatic approval of the Keystone Pipeline, the biggest straw into the pipelines yet, onto a must-pass transportation bill. So the other crucial analysis that emerged yesterday is probably just as important. It demonstrates the real power behind the drive for tar sands oil: the Koch Brothers. They'd long insisted that they didn't have a stake in the Keystone Pipeline, and in the most narrow lawyerly sense that may be true. But the expose from from journalist David Sassoon pierced the secrecy of the Koch brother's private holdings to show that \"at the top of the list are the Koch family's long and deep investments in Canada's heavy oil industry, which have been central to the company's initial growth and subsequent diversification since 1959.\" Their companies are among the largest importers of tar sands crude to the U.S., and the largest holders of mineral leases across Alberta -- they're up to their necks in the tarry stuff.And to protect that investment, they've done what they always do: buy influence. According to an article last year in the Los Angeles Times, Koch Industries and its employees were the largest oil and gas industry donors to the new members of the House subcommittee on energy and power, including new chair Fred Upton of Michigan, contributing $279,500 to 22 of 31 Republicans, and $32,000 to five Democrats. Little wonder, then, that Upton -- long considered an environmental moderate in the GOP -- soon became the leader of the fight to build the Keystone Pipeline, even now pushing to shut down environmental reviews and provide a permit.The irony of the Koch Brothers involvement should be lost on no one. The only argument for building the pipeline (which will export its oil off the continent and do nothing at all about gas prices) is that it will provide several thousand good-paying construction jobs. That's nothing to sneeze at. But in so doing it will prop up the people doing most to undermine the union movement in this country. Construction workers that depend on, say, the Davis-Bacon Act and its support for prevailing wages on public projects have their most powerful enemy in the Kochs, who have helped create the anti-union campaigns in Wisconsin, Indiana, and so many other places.Despite the power of the Kochs, this battle is still very much alive. First Nations people rallied in Toronto yesterday -- environmentalists and trade unionists have joined with indigenous people across Canada in an inspired fight against other proposed pipelines that would carry tar sands crude to China. So far they're winning -- the projects have drawn more public comment and opposition than any infrastructure plans in Canadian history. It's entirely possible that we'll be able to keep most of the tar sands oil in the ground.It's also entirely possible that oil money will carry this fight as it has so many others -- at the moment in Washington, only a handful of senators, led by Barbara Boxer, stand in the path of congressional approval. But at least, as of yesterday, we know exactly the stakes and exactly the players."}, {"title": "Heartland Institute's Insurance Project To Depart After Controversial Billboard Campaign", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Heartland Institute announced Friday the spin-off of its insurance research project, effective May 31.

We look forward to working together for many, many years on our common goals.\"The announcement is part of a larger defection from Heartland that kicked off following the launch of its Chicago billboard and mounting pressure from organizations like Forecast the Facts, a group that advocates for global-warming awareness.The billboard featured Ted Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber, along with the words, \"Do you still believe in global warming? I do.\" Among the sponsors that have jumped ship are the United Services Automobile Association, beverage giant Diageo (the parent organization to Guinness, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Moet & Chandon) and automobile insurance company State Farm, which said in a simple statement on Tuesday, \"State Farm is ending its association with the Heartland Institute. This is because of a recent billboard campaign launched by the Institute.\"E&E News has reported that the institute's board of directors was not consulted before the group launched the explosive campaign. Evan Lehmann reports:According to three people with knowledge of Heartland's campaign, the surprise ad comparing Unabomber Ted Kaczynski to advocates of reducing greenhouse gases prompted a sudden conference call last Friday between the board and the group's president, Joe Bast. The call occurred hours after the electronic billboard became active Thursday afternoon. The ad was canceled before rush hour Friday.While Heartland has taken its billboard down, it has not apologized for the ad campaign, and the language is still featured on its website.In a statement issued Friday the Institute attempted to put a positive face on the departure of its insurance project:\"We're convinced this will be a win-win situation for Heartland as well as Eli Lehrer and his team of very skillful and devoted policy experts.

You could see her backpedaling, and then you just see a black cloud forming around her. And by the time she screamed again, we pretty much knew,\" one witness, Michael Curran, told CBS Miami. \"I started calling 911 as they dragged her onto the sand. Just saw, real bad shark bite.\"\"It was from a foot above her knee to half her calf was just gone. It wasn't like it was still there. It was just gone,\" another witness, Scott Weston, told the station.Lifeguard Eric Toomso was on a nearby boardwalk when he heard Stei scream and rushed into the water to pull her out, with help from several other people near the scene, United Press International reports.Luckily for Stei, a fire rescue helicopter happened to be flying above the water when the attack occurred, and touched down after the pilot saw the incident. She was flown to Lawnwood Regional Medical Center & Heart Institute in Fort Pierce and immediately underwent emergency surgery.Stei is now in stable condition, and discussions are underway about the huge schools of common bait fish that gather close to shore around this time of year, attracting sharks as well as predators like bluefish, mackerels and jacks.\"There have been a ton of sharks around,\" Capt. Brian Williamson, a fishing guide who runs a tackle shop and full service charter fishing company in Vero Beach, told WPTV.\"A lot of my regulars that come by the shop are saying it's been harder to catch bait off the beach lately than it is to catch sharks,\" he said.According to Local 6 News in Orlando, shark bites are rare in Indian River County, where Vero Beach is located. Between 1882 and 2011, there have been only 17 reported attacks.But in other Florida counties, it's a different story. Brevard County, which borders Indian River County to the north, has logged 103 shark bites since 1882.And to the north of Brevard County lies the \"shark bite capital of the world,\" Volusia County, according to Local 6 News. That county saw 242 attacks during the same time period.WATCH:"}, {"title": "Dimock, PA Water Deemed Safe By EPA", "text": "By Timothy Gardner  WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said drinking water is safe to consume in a small Pennsylvania town that has attracted national attention after residents complained about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas.  The EPA has completed testing water at 61 homes in Dimock, Pennsylvania where residents have complained since 2009 of cloudy, foul-smelling water after Cabot Oil & Gas Corp  drilled for gas nearby.  \"This set of sampling did not show levels of contaminants that would give EPA reason to take further action,\" Roy Seneca, a spokesman for the regional EPA office, said about the final set of data released Friday. The agency released data for only 59 of the homes as they could not contact residents at two of them.  Dimock became ground zero for the debate about fracking after Josh Fox, the director of Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary called \"Gasland,\" visited the town and met residents who feared their water was contaminated by the drilling.  Techniques including fracking have revolutionized the U.S. natural gas industry by giving companies access to vast new reserves that could supply the country's demand for 100 years, according to the industry.  Environmental and health groups, however, say that some fracking operations near homes and schools pollute land and water.  The EPA will re-sample four wells where previous Cabot and state data showed levels of contaminants, but where EPA's first round of testing did not find levels that would require action, Seneca said.  The agency found one well in the last batch of data that contained methane, a main component of natural gas.  Seneca would not say what the agency thought the source of that methane was, but said the agency will conduct a review of the data.  Residents have complained that methane could be from fracking, but industry groups say methane can occur naturally in wells in energy-rich areas.  Over the course of the EPA tests that have been released since mid-March, contaminants were found in some wells. But the EPA said those levels were safe. In the first set of tests, for example, six of 11 homes showed concentrations of sodium, methane, chromium or bacteria. Arsenic was also found at two homes, but, again, levels were deemed safe.  Cabot spokesman George Stark said any contaminants found in the tests \"are more likely indicative of naturally-occurring background levels or other unrelated activities.\"  Another three Dimock homeowners had wanted their water to be sampled by the EPA but they have not scheduled a time for the testing."}, {"title": "In Indonesia, Community Patrol Shuts Down Shark Crimes", "text": "Nestled to the northwest of the Island of New Guinea, within Indonesia's West Papua Province, there is a 46,000 square kilometer stretch of ocean spotted with a stunning chain of small islands named Raja Ampat (the Four Kings). Sitting at the center of the Coral Triangle, Raja Ampat is famous for its unparalleled marine biodiversity-there are more marine species recorded there than any other place on Earth of that size.Recognizing Raja Ampat's natural beauty and the value its intact ecosystems provide for local communities in the form of food, coastal protection, and tourism revenue, the communities and government of Raja Ampat have established a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) throughout its borders and further designated the entire area a shark sanctuary. These efforts are starting to pay off, with fish -- especially higher predators like sharks -- starting to rebound inside the MPAs.Unfortunately, these increases make the area a target for illegal activity. In an incident last week, that was reported on by the Washington Post and Jakarta Post, 33 poachers were caught red-handed within the borders of the Kawe MPA, one of the MPAs within Raja Ampat, an area which is under local, regional, and national protection and over 97 percent of which is entirely closed to fishing. Tragically, they had already caused substantial damage by killing large quantities of sharks and other marine life.Fishing vessels tethered together after being apprehended by the Kawe joint patrol team.What makes this story unique is not what the poachers took out of the water -- an estimated market value of $160,000 USD of shark fins, shark and ray carcasses and sea cucumbers. No, the exceptional part of this story is that these fishermen were intercepted and stopped by a local community patrol led by the rightful custodians of this area, the Kawe tribe.Up through the beginning of this century, the region had been notorious for illegal fishing activities like blast fishing and shark finning, mostly conducted by outside fishermen who had come to Raja Ampat after depleting their own waters. In 2006 however, the Kawe people, whose lives depend on the natural resources of the sea decided to take action. They declared a 383,000 acre MPA, eventually recognized by the regional and national governments, and took back control and protection of their own resources.While Raja Ampat police officer reviews the vessels documents, a staff member from Conservation International, Abraham Goram, that supports the local communities and governments in their managment of the MPA, exaplained the protected area status of Kawe to three of the fishermen.Managed and patrolled by the local villagers for six years, the Kawe MPA began to see results as reefs damaged by explosive fishing started to grow new coral and the shark population began to rise. In this part of the world, that rebound in the shark population can bring a lot of value. Marine tourism is one of the most important and fastest growing industries in Raja Ampat and is already bringing significant revenue and livelihood opportunities to the local communities and government. The revenues generated from tourist fees alone contribute an additional $380,000 per year for social programs and conservation actions that directly benefit the local communities, on top of the jobs and revenues created through tourism businesses.Unfortunately a resurging shark population is also a strong motivator for fishermen to risk entering protected areas like the Kawe MPA.The Kawe tribe protects the area for the benefit of their children, so they guard it bravely and passionately. When reports came in, late on a Sunday evening, that seven fishing vessels were in their no-take waters, they rushed into action -- quickly getting support from the regency government of Raja Ampat and the Indonesian Navy for a mission to intercept the poachers the following day.Fresh shark fins drying on the deck of one of the apprehended vessels.Thankfully for all involved, the tense situation when the patrol boat stopped the seven fishing vessels and the patrol members boarded the ships did not erupt into violence. They seized all of the poacher's catch, their documentation, and all of their illegal long-line fishing gear (used to catch sharks) and compressors (used to harvest sea cucumbers).Unfortunately the patrol was unable to bring the poachers into custody due to the difficulty of controlling a large number of now angry poachers on seven different boats with only a small patrol team. The boats fled and unfortunately still remain at large. Action must now be taken to bring them to justice; the chase is on to recapture them.When their territory was under attack, the rightful custodians of this natural wonder, the Kawe tribe, took action to fight for the resources that they depend upon for survival -- with support from government, the navy, and conservation organizations.While the people of Raja Ampat still have many challenges ahead, their story is proof that communities can be empowered to protect their own resources, and an inspiration to the thousands of community groups and governments around the world who are working to protect their marine ecosystems from similar threats. The ocean and the life within it are too valuable to give up without a fight.Photos by Abraham Goram, courtesy of Conservation International."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Keystone Pipeline Debate Reopens With Submission of New Application", "text": "The U.S. Department of State has received a new application from TransCanada -- the company behind the controversial Keystone XL project -- to ship crude oil via a proposed pipeline running from the Canadian border to existing infrastructure in Nebraska. TransCanada had its initial application rejected by the Obama administration in January. The reapplication to the U.S. State Department on Friday calls to reroute the pipeline around the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills Region of Nebraska -- adding miles onto the project. Despite the new route, some in Nebraska still oppose the plan. The pipeline is causing other problems as lawmakers debate a multi-year surface transportation plan -- the first one since 2005.If approved, construction on the pipeline could happen in early 2013, with oil flowing as soon as 2014, according to The Canadian Press.That same day, the Obama administration issued a proposed rule requiring companies drilling for natural gas on federal and tribal lands to disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. While the rules also set standards for proper construction of wells and wastewater disposal, disclosure of the chemicals used in the \"fracking\" process would not have to be reported until after work is complete. The regulations, which could go into effect by the end of the year, spurred debate among environmentalists, industry and lawmakers--with some saying the rules didn't go far enough. Others highlighted the \"toughest\" provisions, which require tests of wells' physical integrity and expand the scope of water protected from drilling -- but pointed out the rules \"only apply to a sliver of the nation's natural gas supply.\"Gas prices have continued a steady decline the last five weeks, causing the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to revise forecasts for the summer -- predicting motorists will spend $10.7 billion less than previously estimated.Heartland Institute Pulls Controversial BillboardsThe Heartland Institute made headlines again recently for their campaign -- in billboard ads -- that linked terrorists to the belief in manmade global warming. The failed campaign attacking the existence of climate change prompted a firestorm of criticism and recalled another kerfuffle involving the Institute earlier this year. Reactions to the campaign caused the Institute to announce removal of the billboards after being up just 24 hours. Even after they were removed, some donors pulled funding for the Institute, but others weren't so quick to cut their ties with the organization.A new study focuses blame for warming on another species entirely. It links methane emissions from dinosaurs, the sauropod specifically, to climate change in the past and a warmer Mesozoic era. Like the dinosaurs before them, modern-day methane emitters such as cows and sheep are being studied to determine how the methane they emit could be contributing to warming. Regardless, according to the study, emissions from dinosaurs were far larger than those of our modern-day plant-eating animals, and in fact may have equaled all modern methane emissions -- both natural and manmade.New data sheds li\u00adght on the speed of melting glaciers, and how their changes affect sea levels. Greenland's ocean-bound glaciers accelerated by an average of 30 percent from 2000 to 2011 -- not quite as quickly had been estimated in previous worst-case scenarios, but still a cause for concern.The Rise and Fall of RenewablesWhile a solar-powered boat was circumnavigating the world, on land the U.S. activated the first solar power project on federal land near Las Vegas. Meanwhile, residential solar leasing is taking off, Motley Fool reported. And in the next five years, the world's solar power generating capacity is predicted to grow more than 200 percent, although public support for green energy initiatives has dropped recently.Japan may be taking steps toward renewable energy after taking its last nuclear reactor off line last week. The move left the country without nuclear power for the first time since 1970. But MSNBC insisted renewables wouldn't bring immediate relief, as only 10 percent of Japan's power generation currently comes from renewables. Saudi Arabia is exploring whether it can generate a third of its electricity by way of solar power.In the U.S., the renewable winner may not be necessarily who you think, according to the Washington Post. The EIA now has a map showing a large uptick in renewables between 2001 and 2011. This surge in renewables can largely be attributed to state renewable portfolio standards requiring utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable sources, federal production tax credits and stimulus grants. The stimulus grants have expired; the tax credit for wind will expire at the end of 2012. The Guardian reports there is an effort underway by conservative think tanks in the U.S. to eliminate all government programs aimed at promoting the use of renewables.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

Her fashion brand, RainTees, is designed in 100 percent organic cotton and was one of the first eco-conscious brands on the market. It launched at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in 2008 and today, RainTees works with nonprofit partners in more than 38 countries and operates a pen-pal program linking fans with at-risk youth in developing nations.Every RainTee sold results in the planting of a tree, and the line has helped reforest mass areas of land that are being destroyed by logging, oil drilling and ranching. Her work has also helped spread awareness about the largest environmental court case in history, occurring in the Ecuadorian Amazon where more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste were dumped by a multi-national oil company onto indigenous lands.Hemispheres Magazine nominated her a \u201chero\u201d for her environmental achievements, and celebrity photographer John Russo featured her in his book, \"100 Making a Difference,\" alongside first lady Michelle Obama and director Steven Spielberg. She has spoken at TedX, at universities across the country, including the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM) \u2014 also the the West Coast Home of \"Project Runway\" \u2014 and has spoken on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., alongside celebrities, politicians and NASA scientists about sustainability and climate change. She has also written an award-winning children\u2019s book entitled \"From the Jungle\u2019\" that will launch in June that highlights the lives and journeys of four children living in endangered tropical rain forests.I had to figure out how this passionate 29-year-old got where she is and what she was up to next.MNN: How did your early experiences and fashion experience inform your activism?Beth Doane: I have been in love with nature and wildlife since I was a little girl, and my first attempt to save our rain forests was in second grade. I was pretty persuasive in my cause and managed to collect all my friends' lunch money. I got sent to the principal's office as a result, but my passion never really faded. As a young woman in the fashion industry many years later, I saw firsthand how toxic fashion production is environmentally and for millions of garment workers (mostly females) around the globe.I was shocked by the human rights violations that occur in manufacturing and also by the rate at which \"fast fashion\" is destroying our planet. Fast fashion evolved as retailers and brands realized they could greatly increase their profits by producing multiple collections each year and like fast food, fast fashion is made using crappy materials that are cheap to produce, cheap to purchase and come with a dangerously high cost to humans and the Earth. It's a completely unsustainable way of doing business and what I learned changed the direction of not just my career but my life.Why are you so passionate about environmental issues?  I think what drove me as a child and what still inspires me today is what most of us know instinctively \u2014 we are not merely on this Earth, we are of it and so much a part of it that whatever we do to this planet we are in essence doing to ourselves. I think that when we are ready to see this truth with open eyes, we will then see massive change occur because we will no longer behave in ways that ensure the demise of the human race as we are doing today.We are running out of time to combat the effects of human-induced climate change and we have to take this seriously. The more people that truly understand what is happening the better chance we have at turning around the crisis we are facing.We have become so disconnected and so separate from nature it is actually killing us and we don't even see it \u2014 we even go as far as to deny what we do see.You have spent more time than most Westerners with indigenous people. How have they influenced you? I love spending time with indigenous people. They value and understand nature and would never destroy it for the immediate monetary gain that we are taught from a very young age is acceptable in so much of our Western culture.They respect the delicate balance of our planets intricate ecosystems and I am continually mesmerized, amazed and given so much hope by the ways they live their lives. I love speaking about the benefits and scientifically proven positive effects that being immersed in nature provides our human body and our minds, and I have experienced that myself form my time spent with tribal people.What is your passion when it comes to the planet? What issue is most important to you?  Reforestation is crucial; we can't continue to destroy the lungs of our planet and expect to survive. This is why I focused on reforestation with my brand RainTees. Trees are so powerful and provide a very viable solution to curbing CO2 and its appalling to me the rate at which we are destroying our world's forests from Canada to Cambodia to Colombia. When we destroy a forest we destroy more than land. We eradicate native species, thousands of which are facing extinction today, we alter weather patterns, we displace indigenous people and cause intense pollution. I speak a lot about \"the power of planting\" and how a single mature tree can actually absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 48 pounds or more!What is your 10-year goal? 20? My goals are all about creating a world where we value our natural resources, where we value each other and where we actually work together to create what we want and not against each other. Through education I believe that's possible. We can't expect people to change what they don't really understand. It starts with awareness and it's why I spend so much time writing and speaking about what I have learned and my personal experiences.What kind of advice would you give to a young person regarding how they can get involved in environmental work?  Find your passion first. Amazing things happen when we are aligned with what really inspires us to make a difference. I believe every single one of us has something powerful and profound to share. When we know what that thing is and what we stand for, there are so many incredible organizations doing amazing work for us to contribute to.I see a lot of people, friends, colleagues, etc., starting new foundations or charities, but this is not always necessary or even the best way to make a difference in my opinion. There is so much that can be done through already existing channels. Explore sites like charitynavigator.org. I am also a massive supporter of microcredit and there are incredible organizations that specialize in this. It really does change lives, and I believe social business and brands that give back are the answer moving forward which is why I designed a social business over a nonprofit.What's your favorite place to spend time in? I love the Eastern coast of Africa and so many countries in Latin America.

She lay in a thicket. Thrashing around in the attempt to stand up, one leg was stuck up a tree.I could stand a few feet from her. I watched her carefully, as she watched me. The front right leg still hideously swollen -- younger than I thought, small adders: she had not yet calved. And now no more chances.  Insects buzzed, birds called, a normal day.Surreal: a still alive African elephant, fearful, mighty, impossible to tame? I saw only a creature in pain, hurt by greed and cruelty, helpless, at the mercy of our whim.With love and shame, I reached out to touch her. Her open eye rotated focusing on me, staring wildly, inflamed, terrified, watching me as I watched her.I sent to my car for my yellow shawl to shelter her eye from the light. She twirled it up in her trunk -- soft and supple like the arm of a child -- and it lay discarded in the mud.I called the KWS vets: very helpful, concerned, but Sunday, would take them a day to sort out a chopper: too late I knew -- an elephant cannot lay down long -- and pointless anyway. They had tried their best: if the antibiotic had not acted by now, nothing more they could do: broken front leg infected by arrow? By bullet? Doomed.I knew the decision would have to be mine.It started to rain. It stopped. The sun drew its arc in the sky.I sat in silence with the dying, helpless elephant female. Her deep rumble like the breath of the African earth.  She knew I was there and a strange stirring link was formed in those hours: I tried with all myself to bridge worlds without words, I told her my love and my friendship, my solidarity and my sadness and my pain and my shame at being human. I let her feel that she was not alone and I would help her.Night would bring the hyenas, and lions would find her. They would tear into her, stomach first, eat her when still alive.Her death would be horrible, violent, slow. I had to spare her this. It was up to me.The rangers had been brought tea and food.They sat hushed, in the shade of a bush, waiting for the decision I would make. There could only be one -- we all knew. Play God. How dared I?Heart breaking heart broken.I phoned my warden, I told him. He agreed.I chose the friend who I knew was the most competent to do what had to be done. He flew in. I was grateful.One shot. It was over.In the mud my yellow scarf was soaked in blood. A long way from the London shop where I had bought it-a life time ago.Her long lashed yellow eye stared unseeing. She was beautiful.\"Mungu of the elephant will take care of her now\", said Merino.Is there a resting place, where the elephants go, endless pastures safe from the intrusion of humans, mighty forests with ripe fruits and lakes of fresh waters where to play undisturbed?Ol ari Nyiro was once, just yesterday, the Shangri La of the elephant. Will it again be? Is there no end to the raping of the wild?Leaving the rangers to remove the tusks, I turned and walked to my car, feeling I had aged ten years.The elephant female is casualty no. 25 in Ol ari Nyiro this year, an unprecedented, horrifying, unforgivable number of deaths by poaching.She is one of the thousands voiceless martyrs of a despicable, anachronistic, criminal market that goes on to this time.  The time has come to ask for your help to PUT A STOP to the shameful trade of ivory and body parts of animals for trinkets and unnecessary medicine that is responsible for the current slaughtering of elephants and rhinos on the African continent.And to the unforgivable shame of elephant hunting.You can do it through internet, pressure groups, Facebook, Twitter, you MUST join this campaign. The torment the elephant female and thousands of elephants are going through now in the forests and savannas of Africa, where gangs of thugs now even use hand grenades to exterminate the ones with no choice, with no voice, who hurt nobody and only need to be left alone, is an unspeakable crime and an horror that deserves the contempt and punishment reserved to crimes against humanity.Elephants do not vote: they need champions.

It is important to find a proper way to dispose them, but even that can be difficult. Ultimately recycling batteries is very important, because if they are not dealt with they can leak toxic chemicals into the ground water. So what can we do?Obviously batteries cannot be disposed of with the regular trash. Always make sure you keep them separate from regular garbage. Many retailers, including Target and The Home Depot, have drop-off bins in the front of their entry ways which allow customers to not have to find the proper disposal site. At these sites they pretty much only accept household batteries.If you have an old automotive battery, check with your town's public works department. Many will allow you to drop them off for disposal. If they don't, check a local automotive repair shop. A lot of them will accept them if you pay a disposal fee.One of the most popular ways to deal with getting rid of old batteries is to do it as part of a group. Start a collection box at your office or church, giving your coworkers an opportunity to properly dispose of the batteries.

The mine, called Bear Run, is now the largest surface mine in the eastern United States and a symbol of the revival of one of America's historical coal fields.As coal mining slows in Appalachia, Midwestern fields are drawing new coal investors as more efficient anti-pollution technology at coal-fired power plants has made Illinois Basin coal competitive again.\"It's probably the fastest growing region because now utilities have scrubbers, they can burn that nasty coal,\" said William Burns, a coal industry analyst with Johnson Rice in New Orleans.Coal entrepreneur Chris Cline is betting on an Illinois Basin boom with a planned $300 million initial public offering (IPO) for his Foresight Energy and producers like Peabody and Alliance Coal are ramping up operations or opening new mines.Peabody, the largest U.S. coal producer, opened another new mine, Wild Boar, in Indiana last year and is expanding its Gateway mine in southern Illinois, in a region where Peabody traces its roots back to its first mine in 1895. The Bear Run mine alone employs 460 miners and produces 6 million tons of coal a year.Production in the Illinois Basin, which covers parts of Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky, shrank by more than one-third i n the last two decades on environmental concerns over the high-sulphur content of its coal.The game changer was the advance of anti-pollution scrubber technology that allows burning high-sulphur coal with fewer pollutant emissions, analyst Burns said.Also, stricter emissions regulations requiring scrubbers mean power plants can no longer get by burning lower-sulphur Appalachian coal.Scrubbers using limestone or lime can remove as much as 97 percent of sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions at a coal-fired electricity plant. Most utilities have now installed scrubbers following the 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule that required further reduction in SO2 emissions in the eastern United States.Burns noted that the Illinois Basin was the region most affected by the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments that set federal controls on air pollution.The resurgence of the Illinois Basin contrasts with the central and northern Appalachian region of West Virginia, Virginia, eastern Kentucky and Pennsylvania, where many of its mines are played out or increasingly difficult and expensive to work.\"Now most plants have installed scrubbers and there are very favorable conditions for mining there,\" said analyst Lucas Pipes, of Brean Murray Carret & Co. \"There are still virgin seams that have never been mined and costs are extremely low.\"Illinois Basin coal is cheaper to mine because the coal seams are closer to the surface, and the region is well-positioned to ship coal to Gulf ports for growing U.S. exports, Svec said.\"The Illinois Basin has good growth potential from a variety of perspectives,\" said Peabody spokesman Vic Svec. \"It is a backfill against the continuing decline of central Appalachia.\"LOWER COSTS, EASIER TO MINEThe Illinois Basin, one of America's four major coal basins besides northern Appalachia, central Appalachia and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, has been mined since the 1800s.In the 1970s, it was producing about 140 million tons per year, according to U.S. Energy Department data. But it fell below 100 million tons per year after 1990, following implementation of Clean Air Act amendments.In 2011, Illinois Basin output rose to about 116 million tons.By contrast, Appalachia's total production has fallen from a high of 488 million tons in 1990 to about 336 million last year.Overall, the U.S. coal industry is in a slump, with prices for thermal coal, used for power generation, plummeting as demand from utilities has fallen off.Coal producers, mostly operating in Appalachia, have suffered as power plants increase the use of natural gas, which is at historically low prices, and switch off many older coal-fired power plants.The relatively mild U.S. winter has also led utilities to burn less coal, forcing producers to shut mines to manage supply.The lower prices, combined with the higher costs of mining in increasingly more difficult Appalachian coal seams, are squeezing margins and forcing producers to scramble to find lower-cost alternatives.\"They have discovered that Illinois Basin coal is a suitable replacement of high-cost Appalachian coal,\" said John Hanou, whose Hanou Energy Consulting LLC just carried out a survey on the region's prospects for the next 10 years.Adding to the attraction of Illinois Basin coal is that costs are about 40 percent to 50 percent lower than in Appalachia because the coal seams are close to the surface.Mark Levin, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets, said some companies operating there had mining costs of $20-$30 per ton, compared with as much as $70 per ton in Appalachia.In its IPO filing, Foresight said its average costs last year were $19.85 per ton.Hanou predicts Illinois Basin production could rise to 136 million tons in 2012, with the addition of two Foresight mines.Daniel Scott, an analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co, believes production can increase by 50 percent in the next few years.Peabody produced 28.1 million tons in the Illinois Basin last year and expects to boost mining as it forecasts U.S. coal exports will increase by more than 75 percent to 250 million tons in the next five years.Alliance Coal, a subsidiary of Alliance Resource Partners LP , was the No. 2 producer in the Basin last year with 27.7 million tons.Cline's Foresight mined 10.4 million tons last year but with two mines -- Sugar Camp and Hillsboro -- opening this year, it could rise to 25 million by 2013, Hanou said."}, {"title": "Northern Gateway Oil Pipeline: Canada's Government Looks To Silence Enbridge Opposition", "text": "By Jeffrey JonesCALGARY, Alberta, May 11 (Reuters) - Some opponents of the proposed C$5.5 billion ($5.5 billion) Northern Gateway oil pipeline to Canada's Pacific Coast may not get a chance to be heard as scheduled by the regulatory panel looking at the plan because of federal government moves to streamline the country's environmental review process.As part a series of changes to environmental reviews that are packed into a sweeping budget bill, the pro-development Conservative government seeks to restrict who can appear before regulatory panels to those deemed directly affected by the proposals and those with relevant expertise.The new rules come after more than 4,000 people registered to comment at hearings into Enbridge Inc's controversial Northern Gateway pipeline. The project, which would move crude from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific Coast for shipment to lucrative markets in Asia, is opposed by environmentalists and by many aboriginal groups along the mountainous route in British Columbia.Partly due to the large number of people wanting to have their say, the regulators said in late 2011 they were extending the process by a year to late 2013. It started in January.The \"directly affected\" provision would not force the three-member panel to strike any evidence already presented, but it would give it \"additional flexibility to manage the remainder of the review process within timelines that will be established following passage of the bill,\" according to a government source.The \"new tool\" is aimed at allowing regulatory panels to guard against having their proceedings used \"as a platform for delay and protest,\" the source said.The government says Canadian oil's lack of access to global markets leaves the economy captive to deep oil price discounts. It has accused \"radicals\" of seeking to clog up the proceedings in attempts to force delays in building the pipeline.Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said after the March announcement of the budget measures that the regulatory changes will apply to Northern Gateway.Preventing registered interveners from, say, cross-examining Enbridge when that part of the hearing begins in the autumn is unlikely as it would fuel a flurry of court actions, said Barry Robinson, lawyer for EcoJustice, which represents environmental groups in court cases.A bigger question relates to thousands who have signed up to give 10-minute oral presentations.Almost 175 had appeared by this week, according to the National Energy Board. Another 64 registered interveners, many of them from aboriginal communities, and 383 witnesses on their behalf, have given evidence in locales in British Columbia and Alberta.If each of those wanting to comment has to be vetted before presenting, it would only add another layer of proceedings, stretching the time even more, Robinson said.\"I have somewhat facetiously said, you can give them 10 minutes to hear what they have to say, or we can have a one-hour hearing to determine whether they are directly affected,\" he said.NEB spokeswoman Kristen Higgins said she could not comment on how the new rules might apply to the Northern Gateway proceedings until the legislation is passed by parliament.Enbridge Chief Executive Pat Daniel said on Wednesday he doesn't foresee a major departure.\"I'm not an expert on exactly who can and cannot participate, but I wouldn't expect that any rules of engagement would change from the start of the process through,\" he said.ALBERTA COULD BE GUIDEThe legislation includes a host of other measures aimed to cutting environmental red tape, including hard-and-fast time limits on reviews and allowing provincial authorities to hear some applications if they have the resources and expertise.Green groups have blasted the changes, saying they represent a gutting of environmental law, while government officials have said they will only remove duplication and unnecessary delays, not imperil lands and waterways.Alberta regulators already restrict hearings to those deemed directly affected or having relevant expertise, and that has led to some court challenges. The Alberta rules could be a guide, experts said.\"That's definitely excluded a lot of expertise from environmental organizations, so this looks like an attempt to mimic that model in Alberta,\" said Nikki Skuce, energy campaigner for ForestEthics Advocacy, which opposes Northern Gateway, partly on its assertion that the project would foster more oil sands development and increase carbon emissions.George Hoberg, a University of British Columbia professor who specializes in environmental and natural resource policy, said U.S. green groups have found ways around similar restrictions, including finding local residents, or even municipal councils and mayors, who share their views on projects and agree to participate on their behalf.Still, such moves do not address the larger issues of limiting opinions on important projects such as Northern Gateway, Hoberg said.\"I'm not suggesting that I actually think it's good policy. I think that the direct impact test is far too narrow and a much broader public interest test is very valuable,\" he said.

Further research was required, the official said.A magnitude-9 earthquake and massive tsunami hit northern Japan last year, leaving nearly 19,000 people dead or missing and causing the world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.An earthquake in 1707 caused Fuji to erupt and killed an estimated 20,000 people. (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Nick Macfie)"}, {"title": "Language Diversity Is Highest in Biodiversity Hotspots", "text": "In my decades of traveling the world, I've gotten to see firsthand many of the fascinating human cultures inhabiting our planet, from the Kayap\u00f3 of the Brazilian Amazon to the San people of the Kalahari to the multitude of cultures of Melanesia.Many people from these cultures, including a wide variety of indigenous peoples, live in the most biologically rich regions of our planet -- regions that hold the key to maintaining global biodiversity and ensuring the continued flow of ecosystem services -- such as fresh water, pollination and clean air -- that are essential to the more than 7 billion of us now living on Earth.Yet as globalization moves forward, many of these traditional and indigenous communities seem to be forgotten or cheated out of the equitable distribution of benefits derived from the ecosystem services they steward. Even worse, as many of these vital habitats and territories bow to the pressures of economic development, so too does our unique cultural heritage, which is ever more endangered.As conservation scientists, we have always assumed a strong linkage between biodiversity and human cultural diversity, but it's never been quantified in a way that demonstrates how strongly the two go hand in hand. To remedy this, I and several colleagues recently published a paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the strong and fundamental connections between biodiversity and the diversity of human languages.There is some discussion regarding the extent to which languages are a good surrogate for human cultural diversity, but it would be hard to find a better indicator. Languages distinguish one cultural group from another, they derive from and reflect the world view of each group of people, and they are a source of pride and a record of history that sets each community apart from even its closest neighbors. Consequently, when we decided to look at the linkages between biodiversity and human cultural diversity, we chose languages as the best manifestation of the diversity of the world's peoples.The results of our study -- carried out by Larry Gorenflo from Penn State University, Suzanne Romaine from Oxford University, and Kristen Walker Painemilla and myself from Conservation International (CI) -- were quite remarkable. We began with the best available database on human linguistic diversity from SIL International, which recognizes some 6,900 languages still spoken on our planet. We looked to see how these were distributed globally, especially in relation to the highest priority areas for terrestrial biodiversity -- the 35 biodiversity hotspots and the five high biodiversity wilderness areas that have been central to CI's conservation strategy for the past quarter century.The biodiversity hotspots are the places on our planet -- such as Madagascar, the Philippines, the Tropical Andes and South Africa's Cape Region -- that have lost more than 70 percent of their original natural vegetation and yet still contain high concentrations of endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. Collectively, at least 50 percent of plants and more than 42 percent of vertebrates found in the hotspots are endemics found nowhere else. The planet's high biodiversity wilderness areas -- places like Amazonia, the Congo Forests and the island of New Guinea -- are also rich in biodiversity, but are distinguished by still being 70 percent or more intact.Together, hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas are home to at least 67.1 percent of all plants and 50.2 percent of all vertebrate animals. They once covered about 24 percent of Earth's land surface, but today that coverage has dwindled to an alarming 8.1 percent. What's more, if one looks at the endangered species -- those at greatest risk of disappearing in the next few decades -- we find that between 82-90 percent of the three groups of vertebrates (birds, mammals and amphibians) for which we have the best information are restricted to these priority areas.Yes, that's a lot of numbers, but the bottom line is: These biodiversity hotspots and wilderness areas must be among our top priorities for terrestrial conservation if we hope to preserve Earth's natural ecosystem services and biodiversity for future generations of people.Now consider the correlations and added benefits to language diversity. In our research, we found to our great surprise that these areas of exceptionally high biodiversity are also home to an amazing 70 percent (4,824) of the world's known languages. What is more, many of these languages are also in danger of extinction; other research indicates that 50-90 percent of known languages will have disappeared before the end of the century.If we look at the languages -- and the cultures they represent -- that are most at risk of disappearing this century, we find that more than 30 percent of languages spoken by fewer than 10,000 people and almost 28 percent of those spoken by fewer than 1,000 people are found in the hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. This means that nearly two-thirds of languages spoken by fewer than 10,000 people are found only in these priority regions for biodiversity, a large portion of them indigenous groups that are still highly dependent on natural ecosystems for their daily needs.There are numerous theories about why this connection between species and language diversity exists. One possibility is that access to plentiful, diverse resources in places like biodiversity hotspots reduces the likelihood of distinct groups of people needing to communicate and share resources with other groups. Another theory suggests that during the time of colonization, European countries mostly focused on expanding into regions with temperate climates, therefore limiting contact with people in tropical areas where most of the high biological and linguistic diversity still occurs. For example, the highlands of New Guinea -- the island with the highest linguistic diversity on Earth -- were not explored by the outside world until the early 1930s.Regardless of the reason behind it, at its most basic level this finding further reinforces an ethos that we have at CI: \"People need nature to thrive.\" It also shows that we can have real win-win approaches in which efforts to conserve nature and ensure the integrity of human cultures can go hand in hand.At the Rio+20 conference next month, discussions about the development of healthy sustainable economies will be in the global spotlight. The key message at the heart of these discussions should be that integrating conservation of nature and development initiatives is absolutely essential to maintain the full range of life on Earth, including the amazing diversity, traditions and values of human cultures.To prevent language extinctions, we must redouble our efforts to prevent biodiversity hotspots and wilderness areas from being converted for short-term gain. If we can do this, I believe that we'll have a much better chance of saving the language diversity and cultural heritage of our own species.Dr. Russell Mittermeier is the president of CI.

The sayings are: do not \"kill the goose that lays the golden egg\" nor \"lose the forest for the trees\".The destinations at issue are the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina and the Biscayne Bay National Park off the coast of Miami.National Park Service officials are determined to avoid such sorry outcomes for Hatteras and Biscayne from commercial miscalculation. To achieve this goal, the Service is restricting certain human activities where lax enforcement has resulted in damage to especially fragile portions of the two parks' ecosystems.Conflicts have arisen because local business people tend to view Hatteras and Biscayne foremost as sources of income and only secondarily as national park units with all of the stringent environmental protections that the law demands.Commercial interests' self-serving priorities are those of a distinct minority. The overwhelming majority of the public, who have as much proprietary interest in the national parks as those residing adjacent to the sanctuaries, embrace the aforementioned priorities directly in reverse. It is also a values alignment that the law obligates the Park Service to follow. The Enabling Act establishing the National Park System requires that the Park Service's first order of business is to provide for enjoyment of park natural resources \"in such manner and in such means that they will be left unimpaired for future generations.\" Recreation is important, but clearly not at the expense of unique natural resources set aside for posterity and all Americans.With that principle in mind, the Park Service has designated roughly one-third of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore's 67 mile stretch of beach permanently closed to off-road vehicles (not to pedestrian traffic mind you) in order to protect nesting endangered birds and sea turtles. It should also be noted that only 10 percent of those visiting Hatteras even drive off-road vehicles on the Atlantic coast beach.As for the 70,000 acre Biscayne Bay Park, the Park Service has proposed to make 10,000 acres a marine reserve off-limits to fishing in order to give a badly degraded coral reef and the fish species spawned there an opportunity to recover from excessive human activity.Local merchants have protested that these moves damage business by closing off areas popular with fishermen, even though a depressed economy and high gas prices might well explain any recent visitor decline.If the businesspeople were to get their way, the economic losses from the subsequent environmental degradation would eventually be greater than any suffered from access restrictions.Undaunted, members of Congress from the two districts have dutifully rallied around a bill to overrule the Park Service and modify its decisions. Hopefully, the legislation will be blocked by environmentally sensitive federal lawmakers defending the Park Service formula that allows for the maximum recreational use without jeopardizing natural resource preservation.The reality is that merchants operating next to national parks face a tradeoff. They benefit greatly from their proximity to a prime tourist attraction, but are most impacted economically by restrictions on park recreational use in the name of conservation. If they cannot successfully integrate such a tradeoff into their business plans, they should consider either another line of work or a different place to set up shop."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - May 10, 2012", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport.The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!.IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: The deepest well ever dug; Cyber-attacks on the US natgas pipeline industry; Romney makes big promises to Big Oil; RFK Jr. fights Big Coal in Portland; Schizo Fox 'News' now says lower gas prices are a bad thing; PLUS:  It's official: the last 12 months were the hottest on record in the US ....

The chimps use hard \"nutcrackers,\" which they craft from materials they find in their environment, to break the skin of these nuts against tree root \"anvils.\" The nuts are hard at the beginning of the season, becoming softer and easier to crack open over time. [10 Animals That Use Tools]Each of the three groups of chimpanzees in the national park ranges across about 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers) of land, sharing a border with one of the other groups.One of the groups used mostly nutcrackers made of stone to extract the meat from coula nuts, no matter how soft the nuts were. The other two groups started using wooden tools (which are easier to come by) to break open the nuts later in the season, using the stone tools only for the harder early-season nuts. All three communities had a special preference for how big of a hammer they used.Interestingly, the chimpanzees from separate tribes are genetically the same, so they can and do interbreed between populations. In fact, the female chimpanzees of one group often move to mate with males from another group.\"We have documented differences in hammer choice within a single forest block, with members of three different adjacent chimpanzee communities that are in regular contact with one another and are thus not genetically differentiated,\" Luncz said.Somehow, the females are able to adapt to their new culture's tool-use preferences; the researchers are currently studying these communities further to see how these females are able change the way they use tools.\"In many ways, chimpanzees are very similar to us humans,\" study researcher Christophe Boesch, also of the Max Planck Institute, said in a statement. \"By studying the similarities to our closest living relatives in their natural habitat in Africa, we have the unique opportunity to learn more about the evolutionary roots of culture, which is for us humans one of the key elements of our identity.\"The study was published today (May 10) in the journal Current Biology.You can follow LiveScience staff writer Jennifer Welsh on Twitter, on Google+ or on Facebook.

We're asking readers who care about providing healthier food to school children to take a stand by voting on our resolution: A Farm Bill for Healthy Kids.Be it resolved: Notwithstanding the need for full funding of conservation and nutrition programs, along with other essential reforms, the \"farm bill\" now before Congress shall reduce subsidies for industrial commodity crops by $1.5 billion per year and shall use those funds to serve fresh fruits and vegetables daily to the 30-plus million kids enrolled in more than 100,000 schools now served by the federal school lunch program.I voted yea.What will it be, America? What's on your shopping list for the farm bill?How do you want your money spent on the food system over the next five years?Do you want to throw another $140 billion into subsidies, including a brand-new $33 billion \"shallow loss\" entitlement program that guarantees business income for a few thousand agribusiness operations growing industrial commodity crops?If you want to see what that version of your farm bill investment portfolio will look like through 2017, take a gander at EWG's Farm Subsidy Database.Most of the very same big winners we spotlight will hoover up billions more over the next five years under the bill passed last month by the Senate Agriculture Committee. What's more, that bill also proposes to cut conservation programs and nutrition funds by more than $10 billion.Is the Senate ag panel's bill the best we can do? Or do you want to reclaim a fraction of your money and use it to give tens of millions of kids a shot at forming healthier eating habits by serving them fresh fruits and vegetables at school? You'll support farmers who grow that food in the bargain.The farm bill headed to the Senate floor contains only $150 million annually to provide school children with a healthy fruit and vegetable snack -- only enough for children in 4,500 schools.Is offering a healthy snack the only idea in the farm bill that should matter to the food movement? Of course not. The farm bill should also provide incentives for low-income consumers to purchase fruits and vegetables, support local and regional food sales, invest in organic food, fully fund conservation and nutrition programs and reform farm subsidies.But the farm bill drafted by the Senate Agriculture Committee fails to deliver the recipe consumers are demanding. The committee wants to bestow $140 billion on agribusiness, leaving crumbs -- roughly $200 million -- for healthy food programs.Doesn't it make more sense to encourage a new generation of kids to crave fruits and vegetables -- and to pay for that effort by cutting subsidies to highly profitable corporate farmers and insurance companies?I ask for a recorded vote, America: yea or nay?Or will the food movement pick one of the other two options?Absent? Or not voting?Go to my post at EWG's AgMag to vote,"}, {"title": "This Mother's Day, Mother Earth Wants <i>You</i>", "text": "Photo Credit: Big Stock PhotoHow did a girl raised and hardened on the streets of New York City become a passionate environmentalist, geeky master gardener and full-fledged compost queen? I read Rachel Carson's bestseller, Silent Spring. Carson, a marine biologist, wrote about the detrimental effects of pesticides on the environment in 1962, facilitating the ban of the pesticide DDT in the United States 10 years later. The book is named one of the 25 greatest science books of all times by the editors of Discover magazine.Overnight, I became a Rachel Carson groupie and I went searching for my teammates. I found them at Rachel's Network, a nonprofit organization that builds productive alliances among women funders who care deeply about the environment, health, and women's leadership. These impassioned leaders and agents of change have collected the statistics showing that women are uniquely positioned as environmental stewards and that women in policy-making positions will vote to protect the environment more than their male counterparts.In their latest report entitled \"When Women Lead: A Decade of Women's Environmental Voting Records in Congress,\" they compare the environmental voting records of Congresswomen and Congressmen each from the 107th through the 111th Congress (2001 to 2010). What they found is that women tend to support clean air, clean water, and overall environmental protections within the aim of promoting public health and resource conservation for future generations.This is all swell, you may be thinking. We can stop worrying about clean water, safe food and the ubiquitous barrage of industrial and agricultural chemicals linked to human (and animal) hormonal disruption. Not quite, pilgrim. Why? Because American women account for only 23 percent of state legislators and 17 percent of Congress, and the United States ranks 73rd in the world in gender parity in governance. We are tied with Turkmenistan. Turkmeni-where? (No offense Turkmenistan.)I contacted Laurie Syms, co-director of Rachel's Network, to ask how both women and men could earn some badly needed extra-credit points from Mother Earth.Okay Laurie. Rachel Carson. Who? How can we get the younger generation and my 53-year-old sister to read Silent Spring?Rachel's Network was named in Rachel Carson's honor, and our members perpetuate her legacy as advocates across the spectrum of environmental issues. While her name resonates within our community of influential women leaders, the rising generation is less aware of her significance, while many adults who recall her impact are consumed by issues of immediate concern, such as the economy or personal health.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of Silent Spring, so it's vital that the environmental community seize this opportunity to amplify Carson's call to action. Her catalytic message remains as relevant as ever: environmental issues are fundamental to everything that matters to us, whether it's the impact of toxic chemicals on our health, the risk to national security posed by depleting natural resources, or the untapped economic opportunities in green technology.Our society is more connected than ever before, so we need to meet people where they live. Where Rachel Carson once tracked the silencing of birds by pesticides, we need to \"tweet\" our message to the next generation.Here in California, thousands of volunteers just collected over 900,000 signatures to have the 'labeling of genetically modified food' on the November 2012 CA ballot. This was started by a grandmother! Obviously, women are hearing the call. How can they make sure these critical environmental issues are supported in Congress?Women can increase our collective impact on policymakers by raising our own leadership profiles. Rachel's Network cultivates women's leadership by having placed over 40 women on the boards of major national and international advocacy groups. These 40 women now have a seat at the decision-making table, where they shape the messages sent to policymakers about environmental protection.Women can also leverage our influence by supporting environmental projects that empower women. Rachel's Network partnered with Environmental Working Group to fund pioneering tests that documented the prevalence of toxic chemicals in women's bodies. Among the women tested were five leaders from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, who were then empowered to serve as spokespeople about the need for toxic chemical reform in their communities, to the media, and in Congress.Finally, women can BE the legislators introducing and supporting environmental protection in Congress by running for office! If that seems like a tall order, all of us can also build relationships with our state and national representatives to hold them accountable for their environmental policy decisions.According to your study, women legislators are more likely to vote for issues of health, safety and economics that affect their families and communities. Any difference between the two political parties? 'We conducted an extensive survey of voting records in Congress from 2000 to 2010, using scores published by the League of Conservation Voters to track votes by male and female legislators on environmental issues. Our research conclusively demonstrated that in both the U.S. House and the Senate, regardless of party, women voted in support of the environment at rates that outpaced those of their male counterparts. In the Senate, women scored an average of 66 percent, whereas men scored 45. In the House, women's average score was 70 and men's 47.Analysts have observed that regardless of party, women legislators are more likely to prioritize issues of health, safety, and economics that affect their families and communities. Additional research reveals that while men are driven to run for office to \"be somebody,\" women report wanting to \"do something,\" or help advance the causes most important to them, so they are more likely to reach across the aisle to broker compromises on issues such as the environment. Though we cannot make broad assumptions about what motivates individual lawmakers, we do know this: whether blue or red, congresswomen are greener!You write that adding more women's voices to the U.S. Congress would represent an advance for both women's movement and for environmental champions. We get two for one. I like that.When we released our report, Rachel's Network had already teamed up with The 2012 Project  to persuade pro-environment women to run for office. The report's conclusion only strengthened our resolve to redress the gender imbalance in politics. Previous studies have shown that with more women in office, lawmakers will reach across partisan lines to broker alliances. Now that we have evidence that women are environmental champions in Congress, we can also be confident that with more opportunities to set the agenda, women will place environmental issues on the front burner and build coalitions to move them forward. We are proud that our partnership with The 2012 Project has already resulted in environmental leaders exploring a candidacy this election year, and we look forward to seeing if 2012 can be a true 'year of the woman.'Women account for only 23 percent in the U.S. Senate and 17 percent in Congress. What can Americans do to change that in this critical election year?We change the reality one seat -- at a time. With congressional redistricting leading to an unusual number of open seats, this year presents the perfect opportunity for first-time women candidates to run for office with significantly improved odds. To get to the point where more women are ready to stand for election at the national level, we need to propel more women into the political pipeline at the state and local levels.Right now, barriers that keep women from entering politics include the assumption that they need particular qualifications, such as a law degree or prominent public profile, or that they need to be \"invited\" to run by some official committee of powers-that-be. That's why Rachel's Network partnered with The 2012 Project -- to reach out to women environmental leaders and remind them that their expertise, commitment to the issues, and investment in their communities amply qualify them to run, and to extend an explicit invitation. To any women interested in parlaying their dedication to the environment into a position of greater influence, here it is: we invite you to run, for the betterment of your community and benefit of the planet!Visit Annie at www.dirtdva.com"}, {"title": "Car Guys Know We Need Strong Regulations", "text": "When I got my driver's license at 17, I was curious about how things worked under the hood of the family's battered '63 Ford Fairlane station wagon.

That was 1971.A Car Guy's InsightThough I love to drive, I'm still not a car guy. I defer to a very good mechanic-technician. I trust him. He takes the time to explain repairs, to show me the problem with a part he replaced and tell me why it gave out. I like that, even if I don't always understand what he's talking about. I like his enthusiasm and love of cars.Last August, during the annual inspection of my late-model station wagon, he told me how excited he was about the future of the automobile: the promise of electric cars, battery improvements, near-zero emissions and high-mileage. He was all for \"the government\" pushing for higher auto standards because \"it has actually worked\" even though industry always whines and drags its feet. He cited the example of the catalytic converter.Regulation to Innovation to Breathable AirThe catalytic converter is part of the exhaust system on every car. As engine exhaust passes through it, three toxic compounds are rendered harmless. Along with the phase out of leaded gasoline, this device, conceptualized in the 1950s and refined in the 1970s, had an enormous impact on eliminating smog in cities and it enabled auto manufacturers to meet the stricter emission requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1970 -- requirements that the industry initially fought.Industry Fears UnfoundedWhy did the auto industry fight the Clean Air Act of 1970? Among other reasons: too expensive.\"In an address last week to stockholders [Henry Ford II] said that the average motorist could expect to spend $475 more for his car in 1978 than for a 1974 model [under] the original exhaust emissions standards set by the Clean Air Act of 1970. He said the results might not be worth the price.\" -- The New York Times, May 16, 1974The U.S. Chamber of Commerce even warned that \"entire industries might collapse\" because of the economic effects of the new anti-pollution laws.Entire industries did not collapse. The price to consumers was not nearly as much as Mr. Ford predicted. Today, no one would reasonably argue that the dramatic improvement in air quality was not worth the cost. Obvious, right?Dangerous Attack AwaitsBut the \"too expensive\" argument is being used again, this time to attack the EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Power Plants, which is slated to go into effect next month. This rule will finally place a limit on the amount of mercury and other toxics that power plants can emit to our air.Will it have a cost?Yes.Will the benefits outweigh the cost?Absolutely. It will save thousands of lives every year, and it is essential to protect the health of our children and the environment.However, lying in wait is a killer resolution (S.J. Res. 37), introduced by Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla), that would not only nullify the EPA's life-saving standards, but would permanently block the EPA from issuing any \"substantially similar\" mercury and air toxics protections in the future without express Congressional authorization. This is lethal. Please be sure to contact your representative to express your opposition to this resolution and your support for MATS for Power Plants.Dad KnewThat old 1963 family station wagon didn't come with a pollution control device, obviously. But it didn't come with seatbelts either. When they became available, my dad had his car guy retrofit those in the front and back seats. It cost money, and money was always tight. But he knew that some things are just worth the price."}, {"title": "U.S. Acid Rain Regulations: Did They Work?", "text": "Crossposted with TheGreenGrok.U.S. acid rain regulations have worked. What's more, they didn't seem to get in the way of the country's longest economic expansion.Environmental regulations are none too popular these days. According to some, they're plain ineffective; for others, they're job killers; and for still others they're downright un-American , subversive even. The answer for these anti-regulation hawks: roll back regulations, and rein in or even do away with the Environmental Protection Agency.That stuff may play well to a polarized electorate, but it's not a sound idea. Why? A healthy, vibrant people and environment are what makes living in the United States so great, and we can thank EPA and, more broadly, environmental regulations for a good deal of that vibrancy.Acid rain, according to data I came across last week from the University of Delaware, dropped remarkably in Lewes, Delaware, between 1990 and 2010, a decline attributed to emission cuts enforced through the acid rain program. How did that happen? Funny you should ask.The program to address the growing acidity in rain falling in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s was established in the Clean Air Act amendments signed into law by President George H. W. Bush in 1990. The relevant section, Title IV, required large cuts in the emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from power plants \"to reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition.\" These emissions cuts would have the added benefit of reducing fine particle pollution and ozone, which can lead to aggravated heart and lung problems, including asthma, irregular heartbeats, and nonfatal heart attacks. The cuts would also reduce haze, which limits visibility in places where visibility is important --  our national parks, for example.Quite controversial at the time, Title IV prescribed a cap-and-trade mechanism for reaching a nationwide target for sulfur dioxide emissions -- controversial for acid rain then, controversial for climate change now. Another source of controversy was the program's supposed costs: industry projected them to go as high as $1,000-$1,500 per ton of sulfur dioxide reduced, while forecasting a  hike from all the Clean Air Act amendments on many states' electricity prices of up to 10 percent [pdf]. Other early projections, from sources ranging from industry to government, estimated that the annual cost of compliance for the sulfur dioxide portion of the program would be between $2.4 billion and $5 billion [pdf] for 1995-1999.Bottom line, said many, especially those in industry: too expensive.Fortunately we are in a position to answer that question, at least in part, because the government had the foresight to establish the National Acid Deposition Program (NADP), which among other things maintains a national network of sites monitoring air quality and the composition of precipitation throughout the country.In the case of the acidity of rain, the results are striking. Over a period of 16 years, from 1994 to 2010, we have seen a decrease in the concentration of acid-forming compounds in rain falling on the Northeast, where ecological impacts of acid rain were most severe, and in the Southeast. Other NADP data indicate that lakes and streams in some affected areas have begun to recover. That sounds like success, but there is a caveat. The emission reductions accomplished thus far do not look to be sufficient to have restored some of our waterways to complete health. For example, while \"sulfate deposited by rain in New England\" has declined by about 40 percent, according to NADP data, EPA says \"more time and more emissions reductions are needed before the lakes and rivers in New England will fully recover from the effects of acid rain.\"Nevertheless, it's hard to escape the conclusion that the acid rain program with its use of cap and trade was very effective in reducing emissions of acid rain-causing pollutants. Emissions of sulfur dioxide in 2009 were about one third of what they were in 1990.OK, but What About the Economics?Was the acid rain program an economic downer for the United States? Consider three measures.The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the agency tasked with providing Congress with objective, nonpartisan data and analyses related to energy, has calculated that the annual costs were only $836 million. The actual cost range per ton of sulfur dioxide [pdf] during this period was between $100 and $200. EPA's initial 1990 estimate, which had projected that annual costs for the sulfur dioxide program from 2000 on would rise to about $6 billion annually [pdf], was also off: the actual annual costs for the whole program since 2000 have been about half that [pdf].And the health benefits from Title IV to us Americans in the form of improved air quality are estimated to be in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars annually [pdf]. Not bad.As illustrated below, U.S. electricity prices at first rose modestly before falling through the 1990s as the program was implemented. Prices have risen in the 2000s. The group's latest report projects modestly falling prices in 2013 due to the low cost of natural gas.The environment and the economy. At least in the case of the acid rain program, looks like you can have your cake and eat it to."}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders, Keith Ellison Unveil Bill To End Fossil Fuel Subsidies", "text": "WASHINGTON -- Progressive lawmakers Sen.

He became the highest-ranking official in the Obama administration to do so.Panetta explained that his Department of Defense is facing a budget shortfall of more than $3 billion because of unexpected fuel costs. \"I have a deep interest in more sustainable and efficient energy options,\" he said. Secretary Panetta went on to describe how the U. S. military will be called on for humanitarian assistance in the face of rising seas, longer droughts, and more frequent and the severe natural disasters that are a result of global warming.Secretary Panetta was followed on the podium by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who has served since May 2009. In 1987, the Harvard-trained lawyer became the youngest governor in the nation when he won office in Mississippi. Mabus declared, in an inimitably rich Southern drawl: \"We buy too much fossil fuel from the most volatile places on earth.\"He emphasized that \"drilling alone will never solve our national security concerns over foreign oil.\" Mabus went on to announce that the Navy has made a commitment to get 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources, like biofuels, solar and wind, by 2025. That's the most ambitious goal for renewable energy in the country -- higher even than California's!Mabus pointed out that the Navy has always led in pioneering new sources of fuel, whether it was from moving from sail to coal in the 1850s, to oil in the 20th century, and nuclear energy in the 1950s. \"Every time, there were doubters and naysayers,\" he said forcefully. \"Every time. And every single time, they were wrong and they will be wrong again this time.\"Mabus vigorously countered the argument that renewable energy is more expensive. \"Well of course it is! Every new technology is more expensive. What if we hadn't started using computers because they were more expensive than typewriters? What if we hadn't started using cell phones because they were more expensive than land lines? Where would we be?\"Both Panetta and Mabus are on the front lines again -- in a battle that will help us curb carbon emissions and lead us to energy independence. Anyone want to join the notoriously craven science deniers at the Heartland Institute in their claim that any leader who fights global warming is no better than tyrants and killers like Charles Manson, Osama bin Laden and Unabomber Kacyznski?Go ahead. Make Secretary Mabus' day.PLEASE TAKE ACTION WITH MOMS CLEAN AIR FORCE!"}, {"title": "Get Oil, Gas and Coal Off Welfare", "text": "In the upcoming presidential election, we are embarking on the wrong energy conversation.But, before I start, let me say that everyone including the 1 percent and 99 percent should be in favor of getting mature, highly profitable industries off of welfare.Mitt Romney does not address subsidies for energy on his website. Recently, Obama Energy Secretary Chu announced $30 million for research to find the next energy storage technologies. Yet, neither the current administration, nor the potential Republican administration address the fact that oil, gas and coal are on welfare. In fact, the U.S. subsidizes oil companies by so much that \"over the past two years, ExxonMobil reported $9,910 million in pretax U.S. profits. But it enjoyed so many tax subsidies that its federal income tax bill was only $39 million -- a tax rate of only 0.4 percent.\"To get this done we have to get behind the smoke and mirrors and get to the root issues. There is an assumption that Republicans are against clean energy initiatives. I think that is a false statement. In the Republican primary, Rick Perry, Ron Paul and the presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have said, let's have a level playing field and eliminate the welfare for the oil, gas, coal and mature renewable energy industries so the best technologies can rise to the top. Now Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform and others are instructing their colleagues that Republican = anti-renewable energy. I think Republicans are for the \"all of the above approach.\"Nor do I believe that Democrats totally oppose fossil fuel subsidies. Plenty of them reside in coal states. The Democrats maintained the Ohio Coal Development Office.But facts are facts, and some of the largest growth in exports in the past three years has come from renewable energy. In terms of new generating assets, more megawatts (MW) of renewables were installed in the past four years than natural gas and coal.Clearly, the driving issues in this election are jobs, the economy and getting ourselves out of debt.If the Republicans thought that investing money in only clean energy solutions would get us back to 4 percent growth and hundreds of thousands of new jobs per month, they would be all in.Conversely, if I told Democrats that relentless hydrofracking would balance every budget in the country and achieve the same miracle while securing energy independence, they would be for that. And, we have witnessed that type of thinking in the pursuit of \"all of the above\" for energy solutions.So, for this election, let's acknowledge that environmental concerns are not moving the electoral needle -- natural gas will probably not be adequately regulated until the industry destroys an acquifer. And maybe not even then, when looking at our pitiful response to the BP oil spill. But I think we all agree that energy infrastructure investments create jobs, so why can't we all agree that we need a level playing field to attract this investment in larger numbers? A clean environment is obviously essential to the future, but apparently it is not persuasive enough to get the votes to pass -- maybe 4 percent growth can be.The real question is that with more than 37 conservative groups signing a letter to get rid of most permanent subsidies, including The Heartland Institute which receives funding from the Koch Brothers, outlined in the Green Scissors Report why can't we get the welfare industries of oil, gas and coal off the dime -- the welfare dime. If mature energy sources phased out their subsidies we could receive an extra $300 billion in federal revenues in the next five years according to the Green Scissors 2011 report. With that money you could reduce Corporate Taxes in the US.I understand that to get it done politically, we will have to phase out wind and solar subsidies and I am fine with that as I wrote last year.I noted, \"Permanent subsidies don't create jobs and sharpen the competitive edges of new companies.\" They distort markets by artificially reducing the interest rates paid by the energy companies when they borrow money -- like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do for home mortgages.More importantly, if we eliminated our system of energy tax credits for mature technologies, we could allow small investors to participate in the energy boom. Today, main street investors cannot invest in low-risk renewable energy projects because these investors can only invest in oil and gas tax credits per the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The master-limited partnership that eliminates double taxation only applies to oil and gas as well -- how convenient.I recently read and wrote about The Brookings Institution published paper, dated April 2012, authored by a collective of experts who I respect entitled, \"Beyond Boom and Bust: Putting Clean Tech On a Path To Subsidy Independence.\" It contends that \"US clean tech sectors could falter\" based on the fall in U.S. Federal financial support from $44.3 billion in 2009 to $11 billion in 2014. What Brooking did was prescribe more of the same. So, I had to object, because it is the wrong argument.I contend we must get rid of the permanent subsidies for all mature energy sources. In fact, get them off welfare. So, are the 99 percent + 1 percent with me?"}, {"title": "Jim Jordan Continues Charge Against Solyndra, Department Of Energy Loan Program", "text": "Rep.

It's severance tax on natural gas is essentially zero -- only 0.42 percent. Texas levies 7.5 percent, Oklahoma 7.1 percent, and neighboring West Virginia and Pennsylvania 5.79 percent.So it might seem sensible that Governor John Kasich, whose proudest credential when he served in Congress was that he was serious about budgets and deficits, called on the Ohio legislature to raise the severance tax very modestly -- 1.4-4 percent, but only on oil and natural gas liquids and only 1 percent on methane itself. So small were the increases that groups concerned about the state's huge financial shortfall and cuts to education blasted them, pointing out that if Kasich had simply gone along with Texas, \"enough money would be generated to pay for damages to local roads and infrastructure, stop the layoffs of thousands of police, fire and other public safety workers -- or prevent increases in local property taxes that pay for schools.\"Former Presidential candidate Rick Santorum loudly proclaimed the Koch Brothers-Tea Party orthodoxy on such efforts to eliminate tax give-aways to oil and gas so they would \"drive up the cost of energy, destroy this economy and do so at the behest of a bunch of radical environmentalists who do, in fact, want to drive up the cost of energy and slow down this economy...\"Of course Santorum was talking about President Obama, so you couldn't be sure if this was simply a partisan slam, or a serious, principled policy position -- that taxes on fossil fuels companies are bad, regardless of how low. But the reaction of the Tea Party in Ohio to Kasich's efforts is revealing; it shows just how far the oil industry's hold on the Tea Party faction of the Republican party goes, and how irrational the opposition to fair taxation has become.Kasich was careful to make clear that he wasn't going to raises overall; the increases severance revenues would all go to fund a billion dollar cut in the state's income taxes. That didn't buy him any cover at all. First the Ohio Oil and Gas Association came out against the tax -- or any tax on natural gas liquids, the petroleum like substance that makes Ohio gas drilling profitable.Kasich's response was blunt. \"Special interests have a different point of view than I have on this. This appears to be the first inning of what's going to be a long ballgame,\" he said. Democrats in the legislature supported the tax -- although they wanted to devote the revenues to fund critical public services, not income tax cuts. But Republicans in the legislature simply shot it down as utterly unacceptable. The head of the fiscal committee of the House commented, \"This aspect of the proposal touches on a high priority for our caucus: making Ohio's tax burden as equitable and competitive as possible.\" Let's be clear: to the Tea Party, zero severance tax on natural gas liquids, and $0.20 of tax on a barrel of oil is equitable and competitive -- even though no other major drilling state (except California) is anywhere like that level. As Kasich put, \"This is what the oil companies in Ohio are paying in tax on a $107 barrel of oil -- 20 cents. I'm not kidding you. Do you understand what I just told you? This is what they pay for taking oil out of our ground and selling it to you, by the way, for $4.30 a gallon.\"Kasich had also proposed similarly modest improvements in Ohio's regulatory framework for gas drilling -- these too were shot down by the Republicans in the legislature.You really have to wonder what folks are thinking. To begin with, by shooting down Kasich's severance tax, Ohio Republicans have just disarmed their Presidential ticket in the state. When Mitt Romney repeats his attack on President Obama for trying to \"crush the private enterprise system, to crush our ability to have energy, whether it's oil, gas, coal, nuclear,\" the President can calmly respond, \"These folks are so extreme they think Governor Kasich shouldn't be trying to get rid of tax breaks for oil and gas. Now I have my differences with Governor Kasich, but his being anti-fossil fuel is not one of them.\"And the oil and gas industry? Well, they are busily drilling wells in Pennsylvania -- even Texas with a 7.5 percent severance tax isn't suffering from a mass flight of drilling rigs. So they know they can live with the tax. What they can't live with is the lethal combination of public fear that they won't conduct drilling responsibly, combined with an enemy in the Governor's mansion. Kasich tried to point this out to them:\"If you try to jam this down people's throats, you'll fail,\" he told an audience dotted with representatives from the oil and gas, steel-making and chemical industries. The governor then went on to make a very direct promise, one that should have sent shivers down industry's spine: \"If we do not have a good regulatory format,\" the governor said, \"we're not going to issue (drilling) permits.\"(Can you imagine the outcry from Fox News if Obama had made a similar statement after Republicans in Congress refused to pass his off-shore oil drilling reforms -- \"We're not going to issue permits\"?)But apparently the dominant voices in the Ohio Oil and Gas industry would rather than 100 percent of nothing, rather than 96 percent of a healthy industry. Or perhaps they think that Kasich is just bluffing, pandering to their competitors in the Ohio coal industry -- who, incidentally, also pay an extraordinarily modest severance tax, $0.10/ton. They'll find out soon enough.The reality is stunning enough: a rock-ribbed reactionary Governor who proposes a very modest tax increase on oil and gas that would not even begin to raise Ohio taxes to those in Texas and Oklahoma is broadsided by his own party, while the local voice of the oil and gas industry, oblivious to public sentiment, sandbags even the most modest efforts to improve oversight.It's a commonplace these days how many people in Washington, D.C. who hated him at the time wish for the return of Richard Nixon.

The brick building had many charming features such as fireplaces, ornate moldings and glittering chandeliers in the classrooms. It also had bookcases high up to the ceiling. In my classroom -- the Language Arts room, the top shelves held vintage children's books, some rare first edition classics. The Social Studies classroom had ancient yellowing maps that dangled down from the upper shelves. On the tippy top shelf of the Science room, far out of reach from small hands, stood vintage glass beakers with unidentified liquids from years past when the building had been a doctor's office.One bright spring day, I poked my seven-month belly into the Science room to have lunch with a fellow teacher. A few kids joined us to show off a cool stick they found in the woods by playground. The stick looked just like a boomerang. They were raring to fling it. They had come to ask permission. Before an explanation about why it would not be appropriate to set the stick into flight, one of the children impulsively flung it. The stick hit the top shelf broadside, sending the antique beakers and their contents smashing down. There was glass and liquid everywhere.Within minutes, the other teacher, kids and I were whisked off to the hospital. An administrator had called when he caught wind of what happened. I had never been a patient in a hospital, let alone set foot in a screaming ambulance. The kids needed me not to freak out, so I stayed relatively calm. Until...In a composed manner, the EMT explained the seriousness of the situation to the children. That was the exact moment my blissfully uneventful pregnancy got derailed. In my 29-year-old panicked pregnant state, I heard one of the doctors say we need to watch her for poisoning:\"Mercury and a motherlode of other chemicals could have been lurking in those beakers.\"\"MERCURY! Isn't that the stuff in glass thermometers that you weren't supposed to bite down hard on and break?\"\"Yes, there are three kinds... for a pregnant woman, mercury can be especially damaging.\"3 Types Of Mercury1. Elemental mercury is found in thermometers. The inhalation of fumes from this type of mercury is highly toxic. Mercury can cause significant amounts of neurological damage to babies and children.2. Mercury salts come from industrial emissions. Breathing or ingesting mercury salts can harm the kidneys.3. Organic mercury is what leaches into the food chain. Water can become polluted during the manufacturing of certain types of energy production. The mercury can accumulate in shellfish and fish. Organic mercury acts similarly to elemental mercury.Yikes! Is your heart racing as fast as mine right now? I'm calming myself so I can tell you the rest of the story...After hours of blood and urine testing, and a full ER exam, I was given the green light and told to go home and watch for any unusual symptoms.Unusual symptoms!With pregnancy dreams hopped up on overdrive, even unprovoked, every possible baby horror was passing through my sleep state. Now all of my dreams became punctuated with a capital \"M\" for mercury.This is the first time I've told this story in the 26 years since my daughter was born. We were lucky -- there were no \"unusual symptoms.\" As I am about to celebrate my beautiful, healthy daughter's birthday (she was born on Mother's Day weekend), those dreams are coming back to me. Did politicians think when they sided with corporate energy lobbyists to block limits on mercury pollution that we moms wouldn't notice? Let's prove them sorely wrong, and stand up for our kids by protecting the Clean Air Act.Here's the rub: No matter what age our children are, there are things we can protect them from and things we can't (wayward boomerangs).

Colony collapse disorder has cut through honeybee populations, with some beekeepers reportedly losing up to 90 percent of their stock in recent years. European bee populations are also declining, and so are some species of North American bumblebee. That data is often interpreted to mean that all of the world's 20,000 bee species are in danger, and that we may be in the midst of a \"global pollinator crisis.\" But there's little data to back up those claims, scientists say.\"When you look at what's out there in the public press, the implication is that pollinators are all under threat, that there's some kind of mysterious decline across the board,\" says Sam Droege, a biologist at U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. \"The problem is, there's really no data to show that either way.\"[View the Native Bee Slide Show.]A new paper, published in the Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, offers a ray of hope for native bee species. In this research, Droege and his colleagues compiled a list of 770 species that are historically native to the eastern U.S. They sent this list to a network of bee experts, asking them to note which species they had found within the past 20 years. The survey revealed that 95 percent of the bee species that lived 150 years ago have not gone extinct. Thirty-seven species were nowhere to be found, but the researchers pointed out that those bees had been rare to begin with and were often subject to taxonomic confusion. The paper offers \"a clarification to the 'all pollinators are going to hell' point of view,\" Droege says.It is important to understand the health of our native pollinators, because \"in the absence of pollination, whole communities could collapse,\" says USGS ecologist Ralph Grundel. \"If plants can't reproduce, you lose the primary producers, and then the species that depend on them.\" It is also estimated that bees pollinate about a third of the food that we eat, at a value of about $15 billion per year.Grundel, who was not involved in the research, said that the paper is a good starting point. \"It's useful because they've put together this information on what was out there historically, and what still is out there. But the fact that they're not finding mass extinctions is not the equivalent of knowing whether species are declining or in jeopardy.\"Droege, too, said that the conclusions are weaker than he'd like. \"We'd love to make statements more detailed than, 'Yup, we found 'em!' But if we didn't do this paper, we basically wouldn't know anything at all,\" he says.John Ascher, an invertebrate zoologist at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), agreed. He wrote in an e-mail that \"we don't even know what native bees exist, as many remain undescribed or unidentifiable. Nor do we know where they live, as even state lists remain highly incomplete despite our best efforts\u2026. As to how the bees are doing\u2014we know even less.\"In order to really understand the health of native bees, scientists need to document species' distribution and abundance as well as monitor how those numbers change over time. That's why Droege and several colleagues are working with the U.S. Forest Service to set up a nationwide bee-monitoring program. He recruited 11 experimental forest stations from places as far-flung as Maine, Colorado and Puerto Rico, and has created a standardized, almost foolproof collection strategy.\"It's fantastic that someone is doing this,\" says Rutgers University entomologist Rachael Winfree. \"There are no long-term bee monitoring programs in North America, except for bumblebees. This is not a new idea, it's just no one is doing it.\"Part of the reason there hasn't been a long-term, wide-scale bee monitoring program is because there wasn't an efficient way to collect the bees. Using nets takes time, and results vary depending on who swings them. Bowls of soapy water catch bees effectively, but the water evaporates quickly\u2014meaning scientists have to check the traps frequently. \"Figuring out how much and when to sample is tricky\" with this method, Droege says. A third option uses malaise traps, which are large tent-like nets that funnel insects into jars of alcohol or propylene glycol, but these traps can cost up to $250 apiece.Droege and his colleagues spent years cooking up a solution. They developed a trap made from painted plastic beer cups, soap and glycol. The paint colors attracts the bees, the soap kills them and the glycol preserves them. (Propylene glycol is \"generally recognized as safe\" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.) The foresters at each site set out the traps, collect the captured bees every two weeks and mail them to Droege for identification.The program is in its third year of data collection, but doesn't yet have a name or funding. And so far they haven't needed it; most of the participating sites report that maintaining the traps requires very little money or effort. Henry McNab, a research forester at the Bent Creek Experimental Forest in North Carolina, estimates that on average the bee collections required 15 minutes per week and about $30 per year.Some sites have collected more than 1,400 bees in one summer. They've found several rare bees, and discovered species in places that would typically be considered outside of their normal range or habitat\u2014for example, scientists at the Maine site collected a squash bee (Peponapis pruinosa), a species that is most common in the U.S. Southwest and rarely found north of southern New England.The two-year analysis is also uncovering hints at population trends, although several years' more data are needed to determine whether these hints are significant. \"The main goal is to look at change over time,\" Droege says. \"If we can foresee declines, we can intervene before it's too late.\"By making the monitoring project simple and inexpensive, Droege has made it easy for the experimental sites to continue participating for a very long time. Michael Ryan, a research ecologist at the Manitou Experimental Forest in Colorado, said in an email that \"As long as the Forest Service can afford to keep a site manager at Manitou, we'll continue. And even if the site manager goes away [due to budget cuts],\u201d he added, \u201cI'll work somehow to get it done.\"The simplicity of the program could come at a slight cost. For now, foresters participating in the monitoring program set up the traps in an area of their own choosing, typically in an area that is most convenient. But bees respond strongly to local habitat changes, such as weeds flowering in a nearby field or a freshly mowed lawn, Winfree says. She suggested that by standardizing and controlling the environments around the traps it will be easier to detect large-scale changes in bee populations, rather than the effects of local changes.As the project is still in its infancy, Droege continues to work out the kinks. After he has proved that the experimental design works, he says he'll ask for federal funding in hopes of scaling up the project and increasing data resolution. At the moment Droege alone is tasked with identifying the thousands of bees collected, so he only has time to categorize them down to the genus level. \"To some extent, the really interesting and important questions are at the species level,\" Winfree says. \"The problem with having genus-level data is that, say one species is increasing and one went extinct, you wouldn't even detect it,\" because the total number of bees would stay the same, she says.AMNH's Ascher also pointed out that this monitoring project alone won't to tell us everything we need to know about the bees' status. He said that it should be paired with diverse types of sampling that are better able to detect rare bees, and bees that occupy specialized habitats.Nevertheless, it's a start. And whether or not the project receives funding, entomologists say that the project is a first and is already turning up important data about the U.S.'s native bees. \"It shows how much research can be done on a shoestring budget,\" Bent Creek's McNab says. \"And it's something that we can't afford not to do.\""}, {"title": "The Energy Wars Heat Up", "text": "Six Recent Clashes and Conflicts on a Planet Heading Into Energy OverdriveCross-posted with TomDispatch.comConflict and intrigue over valuable energy supplies have been features of the international landscape for a long time. Major wars over oil have been fought every decade or so since World War I, and smaller engagements have erupted every few years; a flare-up or two in 2012, then, would be part of the normal scheme of things. Instead, what we are now seeing is a whole cluster of oil-related clashes stretching across the globe, involving a dozen or so countries, with more popping up all the time. Consider these flash-points as signals that we are entering an era of intensified conflict over energy.From the Atlantic to the Pacific, Argentina to the Philippines, here are the six areas of conflict -- all tied to energy supplies -- that have made news in just the first few months of 2012:* A brewing war between Sudan and South Sudan: On April 10th, forces from the newly independent state of South Sudan occupied the oil center of Heglig, a town granted to Sudan as part of a peace settlement that allowed the southerners to secede in 2011. The northerners, based in Khartoum, then mobilized their own forces and drove the South Sudanese out of Heglig. Fighting has since erupted all along the contested border between the two countries, accompanied by air strikes on towns in South Sudan. Although the fighting has not yet reached the level of a full-scale war, international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and a peaceful resolution to the dispute have yet to meet with success.This conflict is being fueled by many factors, including economic disparities between the two Sudans and an abiding animosity between the southerners (who are mostly black Africans and Christians or animists) and the northerners (mostly Arabs and Muslims). But oil -- and the revenues produced by oil -- remains at the heart of the matter. When Sudan was divided in 2011, the most prolific oil fields wound up in the south, while the only pipeline capable of transporting the south\u2019s oil to international markets (and thus generating revenue) remained in the hands of the northerners. They have been demanding exceptionally high \u201ctransit fees\u201d -- $32-$36 per barrel compared to the common rate of $1 per barrel -- for the privilege of bringing the South\u2019s oil to market. When the southerners refused to accept such rates, the northerners confiscated money they had already collected from the south\u2019s oil exports, its only significant source of funds. In response, the southerners stopped producing oil altogether and, it appears, launched their military action against the north. The situation remains explosive.* Naval clash in the South China Sea: On April 7th, a Philippine naval warship, the 378-foot Gregorio del Pilar, arrived at Scarborough Shoal, a small island in the South China Sea, and detained eight Chinese fishing boats anchored there, accusing them of illegal fishing activities in Filipino sovereign waters. China promptly sent two naval vessels of its own to the area, claiming that the Gregorio del Pilar was harassing Chinese ships in Chinese, not Filipino waters. The fishing boats were eventually allowed to depart without further incident and tensions have eased somewhat. However, neither side has displayed any inclination to surrender its claim to the island, and both sides continue to deploy warships in the contested area.As in Sudan, multiple factors are driving this clash, but energy is the dominant motive. The South China Sea is thought to harbor large deposits of oil and natural gas, and all the countries that encircle it, including China and the Philippines, want to exploit these reserves. Manila claims a 200-nautical mile \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d stretching into the South China Sea from its western shores, an area it calls the West Philippine Sea; Filipino companies say they have found large natural gas reserves in this area and have announced plans to begin exploiting them. Claiming the many small islands that dot the South China Sea (including Scarborough Shoal) as its own, Beijing has asserted sovereignty over the entire region, including the waters claimed by Manila; it, too, has announced plans to drill in the area. Despite years of talks, no solution has yet been found to the dispute and further clashes are likely.* Egypt cuts off the natural gas flow to Israel: On April 22nd, the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company informed Israeli energy officials that they were \u201cterminating the gas and purchase agreement\u201d under which Egypt had been supplying gas to Israel. This followed months of demonstrations in Cairo by the youthful protestors who succeeded in deposing autocrat Hosni Mubarak and are now seeking a more independent Egyptian foreign policy -- one less beholden to the United States and Israel. It also followed scores of attacks on the pipelines carrying the gas across the Negev Desert to Israel, which the Egyptian military has seemed powerless to prevent.Ostensibly, the decision was taken in response to a dispute over Israeli payments for Egyptian gas, but all parties involved have interpreted it as part of a drive by Egypt\u2019s new government to demonstrate greater distance from the ousted Mubarak regime and his (U.S.-encouraged) policy of cooperation with Israel. The Egyptian-Israeli gas link was one of the most significant outcomes of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries, and its annulment clearly signals a period of greater discord; it may also cause energy shortages in Israel, especially during peak summer demand periods. On a larger scale, the cutoff suggests a new inclination to use energy (or its denial) as a form of political warfare and coercion.* Argentina seizes YPF: On April 16th, Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, announced that her government would seize a majority stake in YPF, the nation\u2019s largest oil company. Under President Kirchner\u2019s plans, which she detailed on national television, the government would take a 51% controlling stake in YPF, which is now majority-owned by Spain\u2019s largest corporation, the energy firm Repsol YPF. The seizure of its Argentinean subsidiary is seen in Madrid (and other European capitals) as a major threat that must now be combated. Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Margallo, said that Kirchner\u2019s move \u201cbroke the climate of cordiality and friendship that presided over relations between Spain and Argentina.\u201d Several days later, in what is reported to be only the first of several retaliatory steps, Spain announced that it would stop importing biofuels from Argentina, its principal supplier -- a trade worth nearly $1 billion a year to the Argentineans.As in the other conflicts, this clash is driven by many urges, including a powerful strain of nationalism stretching back to the Peronist era, along with Kirchner\u2019s apparent desire to boost her standing in the polls. Just as important, however, is Argentina\u2019s urge to derive greater economic and political benefit from its energy reserves, which include the world\u2019s third-largest deposits of shale gas. While long-term rival Brazil is gaining immense power and prestige from the development of its offshore \u201cpre-salt\u201d petroleum reserves, Argentina has seen its energy production languish. Repsol may not be to blame for this, but many Argentineans evidently believe that, with YPF under government control, it will now be possible to accelerate development of the country\u2019s energy endowment, possibly in collaboration with a more aggressive foreign partner like BP or ExxonMobil.* Argentina re-ignites the Falklands crisis: At an April 15th-16th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia -- the one at which U.S. Secret Service agents were caught fraternizing with prostitutes -- Argentina sought fresh hemispheric condemnation of Britain\u2019s continued occupation of the Falkland Islands (called Las Malvinas by the Argentineans). It won strong support from every country present save (predictably) Canada and the United States. Argentina, which says the islands are part of its sovereign territory, has been raising this issue ever since it lost a war over the Falklands in 1982, but has recently stepped up its campaign on several fronts -- denouncing London in numerous international venues and preventing British cruise ships that visit the Falklands from docking in Argentinean harbors. The British have responded by beefing up their military forces in the region and warning the Argentineans to avoid any rash moves.When Argentina and the U.K. fought their war over the Falklands, little was at stake save national pride, the stature of the country\u2019s respective leaders (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher vs. an unpopular military junta), and a few sparsely populated islands. Since then, the stakes have risen immeasurably as a result of recent seismic surveys of the waters surrounding the islands that indicated the existence of massive deposits of oil and natural gas. Several UK-based energy firms, including Desire Petroleum and Rockhopper Exploration, have begun off-shore drilling in the area and have reported promising discoveries. Desperate to duplicate Brazil\u2019s success in the development of offshore oil and gas, Argentina claims the discoveries lie in its sovereign territory and that the drilling there is illegal; the British, of course, insist that it\u2019s their territory. No one knows how this simmering potential crisis will unfold, but a replay of the 1982 war -- this time over energy -- is hardly out of the question.* U.S. forces mobilize for war with Iran: Throughout the winter and early spring, it appeared that an armed clash of some sort pitting Iran against Israel and/or the United States was almost inevitable. Neither side seemed prepared to back down on key demands, especially on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and any talk of a compromise solution was deemed unrealistic. Today, however, the risk of war has diminished somewhat -- at least through this election year in the U.S. -- as talks have finally gotten under way between the major powers and Iran, and as both have adopted (slightly) more accommodating stances. In addition, U.S. officials have been tamping down war talk and figures in the Israeli military and intelligence communities have spoken out against rash military actions. However, the Iranians continue to enrich uranium, and leaders on all sides say they are fully prepared to employ force if the peace talks fail.For the Iranians, this means blocking the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel through which one-third of the world\u2019s tradable oil passes every day. The U.S., for its part, has insisted that it will keep the Strait open and, if necessary, eliminate Iranian nuclear capabilities. Whether to intimidate Iran, prepare for the real thing, or possibly both, the U.S. has been building up its military capabilities in the Persian Gulf area, deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups in the neighborhood along with an assortment of air and amphibious-assault capabilities.One can debate the extent to which Washington\u2019s long-running feud with Iran is driven by oil, but there is no question that the current crisis bears heavily on global oil supply prospects, both through Iran\u2019s threats to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for forthcoming sanctions on Iranian oil exports, and the likelihood that any air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities will lead to the same thing. Either way, the U.S. military would undoubtedly assume the lead role in destroying Iranian military capabilities and restoring oil traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. This is the energy-driven crisis that just won\u2019t go away.How Energy Drives the WorldAll of these disputes have one thing in common: the conviction of ruling elites around the world that the possession of energy assets -- especially oil and gas deposits -- is essential to prop up national wealth, power, and prestige.This is hardly a new phenomenon. Early in the last century, Winston Churchill was perhaps the first prominent leader to appreciate the strategic importance of oil. As First Lord of the Admiralty, he converted British warships from coal to oil and then persuaded the cabinet to nationalize the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the forerunner of British Petroleum (now BP). The pursuit of energy supplies for both industry and war-fighting played a major role in the diplomacy of the period between the World Wars, as well as in the strategic planning of the Axis powers during World War II. It also explains America\u2019s long-term drive to remain the dominant power in the Persian Gulf that culminated in the first Gulf War of 1990-91 and its inevitable sequel, the 2003 invasion of Iraq.The years since World War II have seen a variety of changes in the energy industry, including a shift in many areas from private to state ownership of oil and natural gas reserves. By and large, however, the industry has been able to deliver ever-increasing quantities of fuel to satisfy the ever-growing needs of a globalizing economy and an expanding, rapidly urbanizing world population. So long as supplies were abundant and prices remained relatively affordable, energy consumers around the world, including most governments, were largely content with the existing system of collaboration among private and state-owned energy leviathans.But that energy equation is changing ominously as the challenge of fueling the planet grows more difficult. Many of the giant oil and gas fields that quenched the world\u2019s energy thirst in years past are being depleted at a rapid pace. The new fields being brought on line to take their place are, on average, smaller and harder to exploit. Many of the most promising new sources of energy -- like Brazil\u2019s \u201cpre-salt\u201d petroleum reserves deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, Canadian tar sands, and American shale gas -- require the utilization of sophisticated and costly technologies. Though global energy supplies are continuing to grow, they are doing so at a slower pace than in the past and are continually falling short of demand. All this adds to the upward pressure on prices, causing anxiety among countries lacking adequate domestic reserves (and joy among those with an abundance).The world has long been bifurcated between energy-surplus and energy-deficit states, with the former deriving enormous political and economic advantages from their privileged condition and the latter struggling mightily to escape their subordinate position. Now, that bifurcation is looking more like a chasm. In such a global environment, friction and conflict over oil and gas reserves -- leading to energy conflicts of all sorts -- is only likely to increase.Looking, again, at April\u2019s six energy disputes, one can see clear evidence of these underlying forces in every case. South Sudan is desperate to sell its oil in order to acquire the income needed to kick-start its economy; Sudan, on the other hand, resents the loss of oil revenues it controlled when the nation was still united, and appears no less determined to keep as much of the South\u2019s oil money as it can for itself. China and the Philippines both want the right to develop oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea, and even if the deposits around Scarborough Shoal prove meager, China is unwilling to back down in any localized dispute that might undermine its claim to sovereignty over the entire region.Egypt, although not a major energy producer, clearly seeks to employ its oil and gas supplies for maximum political and economic advantage -- an approach sure to be copied by other small and mid-sized suppliers. Israel, heavily dependent on imports for its energy, must now turn elsewhere for vital supplies or accelerate the development of disputed, newly discovered offshore gas fields, a move that could provoke fresh conflict with Lebanon, which says they lie in its own territorial waters. And Argentina, jealous of Brazil\u2019s growing clout, appears determined to extract greater advantage from its own energy resources, even if this means inflaming tensions with Spain and Great Britain.And these are just some of the countries involved in significant disputes over energy. Any clash with Iran -- whatever the motivation -- is bound to jeopardize the petroleum supply of every oil-importing country, sparking a major international crisis with unforeseeable consequences. China\u2019s determination to control its offshore hydrocarbon reserves has pushed it into conflict with other countries with offshore claims in the South China Sea, and into a similar dispute with Japan in the East China Sea. Energy-related disputes of this sort can also be found in the Caspian Sea and in globally warming, increasingly ice-free Arctic regions.The seeds of energy conflicts and war sprouting in so many places simultaneously suggest that we are entering a new period in which key state actors will be more inclined to employ force -- or the threat of force -- to gain control over valuable deposits of oil and natural gas. In other words, we\u2019re now on a planet heading into energy overdrive.Michael Klare is a TomDispatch regular, professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College, and the author, most recently, of The Race for What\u2019s Left: The Global Scramble for the World\u2019s Last Resources.

Scientists Recommend Radioactive Element's Disposal--But Where?", "text": "The vast majority of the radioactive plutonium on the planet is man-made\u2014roughly 500 metric tons, or enough to make 100,000 nuclear weapons by the calculations of the International Panel on Fissile Materials.Much of it is the legacy of the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and Russia in the latter decades of the 20th century but, more and more, it is also the legacy of nuclear power.Now a team of scientists\u2014physicists Frank von Hippel and Richard Garwin along with environmental scientists Rodney Ewing and Allison Macfarlane\u2014suggest that burying plutonium is the only reasonable solution to this problematic stockpile in a comment to be published in Nature on May 10. (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.)They also recommend the U.K., which is presently debating what to do with its nearly 100 metric tons of plutonium, should lead the way by studying how to immobilize the \u201celement from hell\u201d in ceramic pucks that can then be buried in deep caverns or even deeper boreholes.There are other alternatives. The U.K. actually appears to be leaning toward following the example of France and Japan in their attempts to use the plutonium in so-called mixed oxide nuclear fuel, or MOX. This alternative fuel gets its name because it bears fuel pellets made by combining oxides of uranium and plutionium, a fact that also makes MOX more expensive and harder to handle.By one French estimate from 2000 recycling plutonium in this way adds $750 million to the annual cost of electricity generation in France compared with fuel rods manufactured from uranium freshly dug out of the ground and enriched. The U.S. is spending $13 billion to turn 34 metric tons of its plutonium stockpile into MOX at a facility in South Carolina. And the U.K. failed in its prior attempt to produce MOX fuel at Sellafield, which shut down last year after spending $2.3 billion in its abortive attempt.Another option is to use the plutonium as fuel directly in so-called fast reactors, which employ neutrons to initiate fission that are whizzing about much faster than in current nuclear reactor technologies. That high-speed neutron action necessitates cooling such reactors with something a little more difficult to deal with than water, such as liquid sodium (which burns on contact with air or water). And that has meant maintenance problems have plagued the world\u2019s fast reactors, such as Monju in Japan or Superph\u00e9nix in France, although both Russia and the U.S. have each had some successes.In the end such fast reactors don\u2019t so much solve the plutonium problem as delay it: A hole in the ground to hide the radioactive stuff would still be required. So why not just take the cheap route and immobilize it, then bury it, asks the team of scientists?That may be because finding a place to bury it has proved politically radioactive\u2014from Japan to the U.S. Here, Yucca Mountain in Nevada is no closer to being a solution for nuclear waste today than in the 1980s when it was first designated as a final resting place for U.S. radioactive residue.A recent blue ribbon commission recommended starting over from scratch (although the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico has fared better). Nor has the U.S. adequately prepared for tearing down its aging nuclear reactors and dealing with the radioactive waste left behind, according to an April Government Accountability Office report. The problem with treating plutonium \u201cunambiguously as the dangerous weapons material that it is,\u201d as the scientists put it, is that few want to pay to have it buried, even very deeply, anywhere near their backyards.The views expressed are those of the author and are not necessarily those of Scientific American."}, {"title": "James Hansen: Game Over For The Climate", "text": "GLOBAL warming isn't a prediction.

It also sent a political signal to Europe: Canada's fight over oil sands is not done yet.As part its ambitious efforts to cut carbon emissions, the European Union has proposed classifying crude produced from oil sands, or tar sands as environmentalists and others call them, as much dirtier than other fuels.A 2011 study for the EU by Stanford University academic Adam Brandt found that oil-sand crude was as much as 22 percent more carbon intensive.Canada, whose oil sands have helped it become an energy power, fears such a ruling could imperil a resource it estimates will add more than C$3 trillion to its economy over the next 25 years.Which is why Ottawa has waged a concerted lobbying campaign against Brussels' proposal over the past three years. An examination of hundreds of pages of documents obtained under access to information legislation in both Brussels and Ottawa, some dating back to 2009, as well as interviews with leading officials in both Canada and Europe show just how extensive that effort has been.The governments of Canada and Alberta, along with Canadian companies, have wooed dozens of European parliamentarians, offered trips to Alberta and sponsored conferences in an effort that Chris Davies, a British Liberal Member of the European Parliament and a backer of the EU proposal, said \"has been stunning in its intensity.\"Satu Hassi, a Finnish MEP for the Greens and another backer of the EU proposal, said the thing that sets Canada's camnpaign apart is not its size but its official backing. \"There have been massive lobbying campaigns by the car industry, by the chemicals industry, banks, food giants, etc. But so far I have not seen such a lobbying campaign by any state.\"Perhaps the most surprising thing about the campaign is that virtually no fuel from Canadian oil sands reaches European refineries. Ottawa's fear is that a European ruling will influence other markets, including the United States, where Canada currently sends virtually all its oil.\"We don't want the potential stigmatisation and we're quite concerned about that issue,\" Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver told Reuters late last year.\"A GROWING REPUTATIONAL PROBLEM\"Canada's battle with the EU began in 2009 when Europe - the largest economic market in the world - agreed to adopt a measure called the Fuel Quality Directive to reduce the level of greenhouse gases emitted by vehicles.Brussels has still not agreed precisely how that will be achieved, but in 2009 the Commission published findings that tar sands might have a greenhouse gas intensity around one-fifth higher than conventional crude.Nearly all the massive reserves of oil concentrated in the northern part of Canada's Alberta province - home to the world's third largest proven reserves of crude after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela - are in the form of tar sands.The clay-like sands have to be dug up in open-pit mines with massive shovels, or blasted with steam and pumped to the surface, before oil can be extracted. The process means the oil costs more to produce than regular crude, uses more water and energy, and emits more carbon.As Canada has developed its sands - the industry in Alberta grew from 603,000 barrels a day in 2000 to 1.6 million in 2011 - environmentalists and non-governmental organisations have stepped up campaigning against the resource.Canada's Conservative government - which touts Canada as a \"clean energy superpower\" - counters that it needs to defend itself against lies and unwarranted discrimination against the tar sands.Emails from Canadian diplomats and other documents show Canada feared negative publicity could hit tens of billions of dollars of investment in its industry by such European majors as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, France's Total and Norway's Statoil.\"The oil sands are posing a growing reputational problem, with the oil sands defining the Canadian brand,\" London-based Canadian diplomat Sushma Gera wrote in a confidential e-mail on August 20, 2010, which like many of the documents acquired through Freedom of Information legislation has been redacted. \"With (a) recent increase in the NGO campaigns targeting (the European) public, we anticipate increased risk to Canadian interests much beyond the oil sands.\"In late 2009, Ottawa set up a body it called the Pan-European Oil Sands Team, which included diplomats from embassies in London, Paris, Berlin, The Hague, Oslo, Brussels and Canada. It also included representatives from the environment and natural resources ministries, the Alberta provincial government, and oil companies including Shell, Statoil and Total.Officials from the London-based Royal Bank of Scotland - a UK state-owned bank - and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), an energy industry group, rounded out the roster.\"The principal objective of the Oil Sands Team is to reframe the European debate on oil sands in a manner that protects and advances Canadian interests related to the oil sands and broader Canadian interests in Europe,\" wrote one diplomat in a \"Pan-European Oil Sands Advocacy Strategy\" document dated May 2011.\"AT LEAST IT'S NOT BLOODY\"A few months after its launch, the team reported \"a resurgence of highly critical public campaigns\" in Europe which it expected to intensify.\"In order to counter these negative campaigns and media coverage we will have to be proactive but strategic and coherent in our approach. This will require significant resources,\" said one document.CAPP, whose members are a Who's Who of the Canadian energy sector, provided C$30,000 for a conference on \"New Energy Frontiers\" in June 2011 in Britain. Ottawa and Alberta each contributed C$20,000.Canada and Alberta also arranged a series of visits to the tar sand fields for European decision-makers, legislators and think-tanks. Much of the campaigning was done in Brussels and European capitals, with officials from Ottawa and Alberta meeting, phoning and writing to MEPS.Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, used internal EU documents to calculate that between late September 2009 and late May 2011, Canadian officials and diplomats talked to their European counterparts at least 105 times.In August 2010, the Pan-European Oil Sands team reported: \"Oslo holds regular meetings with Statoil to update on each others' activities and coordinate where appropriate. (The) Hague is enhancing its engagement with the private sector and met with Shell recently. Paris has regular meetings with Total ... London is also in regular contact with the private sector including meetings with Shell, BP and Royal Bank of Scotland as well as Canadian oil companies.\"Lars Christian Bacher, president of Canadian operations for Statoil, told Reuters he conducted as many as 50 tours of the company's Leismer oil sands site in 2011, most of them for European officials and media.Last November, Norway's energy minister, Ola Borten Moe, a one-time critic of the oil sands, visited the site and said he was impressed by industry efforts to improve its environmental record.\"People see what it is and what it's all about, and sometimes what it's not all about. Then we can have a more factual-based debate around the dilemmas of oil sands, because we know that there are dilemmas,\" Bacher said. \"But that's nothing different from any other kind of industrial activity.\"The oil sands team also noted that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper met Total's chief executive Christophe de Margerie during an official visit to Paris in June 2010. A spokesman for Harper said the two men had participated in a business roundtable but declined to give more details.\"The lobbying from Canada and from Alberta is quite impressive. They have been really active for the last few years, organising lots of meetings and presentations,\" said one well-placed European Union source.Yet for all the effort, Canada's campaign ran into two problems in late 2011. Firstly, the EU's executive Commission decided in October to ignore Canadian pressure and rule that tar sands crude was much dirtier than regular oil.Soon after, in December, Canada's Environment Minister Peter Kent abruptly announced that the country would pull out of the Kyoto Protocol, which is the first global attempt to slow carbon emissions and is much cherished in many parts of Europe.Canada said it had to withdraw from Kyoto to avoid being hit by penalties for failing to stick to targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Kent, a former television news anchor who was appointed environment minister in early 2011, immediately pushed the idea that \"ethical oil\" from Canada is far preferable to crude from OPEC nations with dubious human rights records.A message from Britain's high commission (embassy) in Ottawa on January 7, 2011 summarised Kent's message as: \"it may be dirty oil, but at least it's not bloody oil\".\"WASN'T MY APPROACH\"That approach ended after Oliver, a sprightly former investment banker who will turn 72 next week, took over the Natural Resources portfolio last May.Oliver has told Reuters that promoting the idea of ethical oil \"wasn't my approach\", and has instead hailed the benefits of oil sands to Canada's economy.He has branded environmentalists who oppose oil sands and pipeline projects \"radicals\" bent on limiting economic growth, and in April angered green groups by taking final decision-making powers on big projects away from regulators and handing them to his own government.Last year, he sent a letter to European officials implying that if Europe pressed ahead with tagging tar sands dirtier, Canada would take its case to the World Trade Organisation.Many in Brussels were livid.\"You can't take Europe to court for treating oil sands correctly,\" said Sven-Olov Ericson, a senior energy official at Sweden's Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications who has been lobbied by Canadian and industry officials.THE VOTEScientific experts from the EU's 27 member states finally gathered to vote on their tar sands proposal in February. But the group was divided: 12 nations voted for, eight against and seven - including heavyweights Germany, Britain and France - abstained. Because of complex voting procedures weighted to reflect population, the outcome was a stalemate.British officials said the desire to help Canada was offset by worries about tensions between members of the country's coalition government.EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard, the most prominent champion of classifying oil sands as a heavy polluter, said that Ottawa's lobbying campaign had made her fear the proposal would be defeated altogether.Canada has now demanded more research into the validity of the proposal. A letter sent by Oliver on March 22 to European ministers said Ottawa remained \"firmly opposed\" to the Commission's proposal because it made \"an unfair distinction between crude from tar sands and other sources of crude\".Brussels says it will study the impacts of its proposal and won't decide anything until next year.\"When the world and these environmental groups are fundamentally opposed to something that is in the Canadian national interest, I believe that the government has an obligation to stand up and say, 'Hey you're wrong,'\" TransCanada Chief Executive Russ Girling told Reuters in late 2011.Minister Oliver agrees. \"We hear a lot from environmental groups, and that's fine, and we should hear from oil companies and from others who may be able to bring some facts to the table and who have interests,\" he said."}, {"title": "The World Is Watching: Will G20 Countries Lead This June at the Earth Summit?", "text": "Three years ago, the Group of 20 countries pledged to phase out environmentally-harmful and ineffective subsidies. The leaders of these twenty influential countries have since made many other promises to deal with climate change and the range of global sustainability challenges, including at the recently concluded Clean Energy Ministerial. As countries meet this week to set the agenda for 2012, they should commit to showing leadership where it counts. This June, we need to turn pledges into real actions starting at the G20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, and continuing through to the Rio+20 Earth Summit (read here and here for ideas).NRDC, with Stakeholder Forum and Road to Rio+20, recently launched the Earth Summit Watch -- a country-by-country progress tracker of the ambition (or lack thereof) of preparations before we all meet in Rio. The UN recently announced that 130 heads of state are already committed to attend Rio+20, but has not released their names, nor is there much information on how their governments are preparing for Rio+20. Therefore, we are gathering our own information on a handful of important questions from countries (\u201cWill your head of state attend?\u201d or \u201cWhat new or scaled-up initiatives is your country preparing for the summit?\u201d). Using these surveys, we have developed a map of where the world stands in getting ready:Promising activities on the Race to RioWe\u2019ve seen a lot of activity already from a number of G20 countries. Germany partnered with Denmark and Spain to release a global renewable resource atlas to map solar and wind energy potential around the world. Italy and the U.S. recently announced the launch of Lighting India, a project to bring modern lighting to two million people by 2015 in affiliation with The Global Lighting and Energy Access Partnership (Global LEAP). The Clean Energy Ministerial concluded two weeks ago with a host of new partnerships on energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy access.G20 countries are making unprecedented investments in clean energy. The U.S. invested $48 billion in clean energy in 2011, up 42 percent from the year before. India\u2019s 2011 investments rose 54 percent from 2010, and the EU in total invested over $92 billion in clean energy. These investments, coupled with massive price drops in renewable energy, will help forge new industries and create thousands of jobs and opportunities.Will G20 countries be world leaders at Rio?However, according to our surveys, only 6 out of 20 of these countries have confirmed that their delegations will be led by their head of state in Rio (just in Brazil, China, India, Italy, Japan, and Mexico). Currently, we only have information from 8 out of the 20 on plans for announcing specific initiatives during the conference. Even fewer have begun to really engage their publics about what\u2019s at stake if this summit fizzles.In these trying economic times, countries are looking to the G20 for not only support but true leadership. As the \u201cpremier forum for international cooperation on the most important aspects of the international economic and financial agenda,\u201d what could be more important than charting a new course toward sustainable economic growth?Let\u2019s not miss this opportunity to deliver progress to put the world on a more sustainable path.

The USAA is a Fortune-500 financial services company that serves 8.8 million U.S. military members and their families. \"In light of recent personnel departures at Heartland, we decided to end our support for the organization,\" the USAA said in a  statement on Facebook.Brad Johnson, campaign manager for Forecast the Facts, a group that advocates for global-warming awareness, responded to the move in a statement: \"Since the U.S. military has recognized climate change as a key national security threat, it's fitting that USAA has pulled their support for an organization that uses Osama bin Laden as the poster child for belief in global warming.\"The USAA's withdrawal is the latest in what has become a small-scale defection from Heartland after it launched a billboard in Chicago featuring Ted Kaczynski (better known as the Unabomber) along with the words, \"Do you still believe in global warming?

Forecast the Facts and Greenpeace pressured insurers to stop funding Eli Lehrer, Heartland's Washington, D.C., vice president, Romm reports, and Heartland was dropped from the websites of the following green coalitions:The Smarter Safer Coalition, an effort to reform the National Flood Insurance Program by top insurers, environmental organizations including American Rivers, the Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, Environmental Defense Fund, Defenders of Wildlife, Ceres, and the Nature Conservancy, alongside conservative groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute, American Conservative Union, and Americans for Tax Reform.Other organizations to abandon the Institute include beverage giant Diageo, the parent organziation to Guinness, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Moet & Chandon, and automobile insurance company State Farm, which said in a simple statement on Tuesday, \"State Farm is ending its association with the Heartland Institute. This is because of a recent billboard campaign launched by the Institute.\"While Heartland has taken its billboard down, it has not apologized for the ad campaign, and the language is still featured on its website.

Unfortunately at the conclusion of the operation he went into respiratory arrest and ultimately heart failure. Despite repeated attempts to resuscitate him, Harry passed away on the operating table.Prince Harry's birth shed light on the endangered species of hippo, which live in West Africa and are threatened by the bushmeat trade, according to the South Africa Star. Wildlife experts estimate there are only 3,000 pygmy hippos left in the wild.But Harry's birth on April 2 also captured the world's attention because the little hippo almost didn't make it: his mother Hilda rejected him and staff members at the Cango Wildlife Ranch had to care for him around the clock in order to ensure his survival.The little hippo was reportedly doing well earlier this month, and discussions were under way to make him the face of South Africa's tourism campaign, according to NBC News.For now, the Cango Wildlife Ranch is urging mourners to remember Prince Harry's accomplishments.\"In Harry\u2019s short life, he managed to raise much needed awareness for his species and their plight in the wild, and Cango Wildlife Ranch will continue to fly the flag of awareness for this species in honour of Harry\u2019s life,\" the ranch said in the press release.PHOTOS, courtesy of Miller and Maclean/Caters News:"}, {"title": "Cross River Gorillas: Rare, Endangered Animals Caught On Tape (VIDEO)", "text": "In what is described as the best footage to date, the elusive Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) has been caught on tape. The video above, from conservationists at the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary in Cameroon, shows the primates milling about in their natural state. One adult can be seen loping towards the camera, beating his chest, while another drags along with only one hand, possibly the result of a snare injury.While the gorillas' behavior may seem unremarkable, the video shows \"the most endangered African ape,\" according to WCS. \u201cThis video gives us all a spectacular view into the hidden world of one of our closest relatives, which is in dire need of our help to survive,\u201d Steve Sanderson, WCS President and CEO, said in a press release.\u201cA person can study these animals for years and never even catch a glimpse of the gorillas, much less see anything like this,\u201d explained Christopher Jameson, Director of WCS\u2019s Takamanda Mone Landscape Project.Thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in the mid-20th century, the Cross River gorillas live in the mountains on the Cameroon-Nigeria border and struggle with a population of less than 300 individuals. They are listed as \u201ccritically endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and are one of the 25 most endangered primates.Although Scientific American notes that the Cross River gorilla habitat is larger than previously thought, the animals still suffer from environmental and physical threats. A mountainous habitat means that the Cross River species is isolated from others of their kind, with the western lowland gorilla (their geographically and genetically closest relative) 155 miles away, explains World Wildlife Fund. The Illegal bushmeat trade and habitat loss also put these animals at serious risk. And even with a protected environment, gorillas breed slowly, usually giving birth to only one infant every four to five years.Established in 2008, the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary was formed by the Cameroonian government solely to protect this threatened species. \u201cSpectacular footage such as this, which we\u2019ve never had before for Cross River gorillas, is absolutely vital to inspire local people, the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon, and the global community to care about and to save this unique subspecies,\u201d Dr. James Deutsch, Executive Director for WCS\u2019s Africa Program explained in a press release. \u201cContinued research of this kind will help fine-tune management plans to protect this rarest of apes.\u201d"}, {"title": "This Mother's Day, Let's Be '7 Billion Strong'", "text": "This Mother's Day is a very special one for me. I'm expecting my first child in just a few weeks. It's a time filled with anticipation and hope. But most of all, this new addition to my family and my life has given even more urgency to our effort to create an inclusive green economy.It's pretty hard not to want to leave behind a healthier, greener, more prosperous world when it's your own child who will be living in it. Maybe that's why women have contributed so much over the decades to movements for justice and peace.In fact, we can trace Mother's Day in America back to an early activist. In 1870, fed up with the carnage of the Civil War, feminist and abolitionist Julia Ward Howe issued a \"Mother's Day Proclamation\" calling for women to band together to promote disarmament and peace. Howe believed women could be an unstoppable force for social change. She was right.From suffrage to civil rights to farmworkers justice, women have played a key role in the progress we've made over the past century. So when we celebrate Mother's Day, we're also celebrating the power of women to change the world.That's why I could not be more proud and excited to announce the release our new music video collaboration for the song \"7 Billion\" by Silent C and Invest.Their song -- which won Green For All's 2012 Dream Reborn Music Contest -- taps into the power of the planet's growing population to overcome poverty and oppression and create a better world. It also highlights the role women play in creating more peaceful and just nations and communities -- and in transforming individual lives.Women like my own mother, who worked hard to support our family. I grew up in the shadow of oil refineries and polluting industry, where, too often, families like mine were forced to choose between their jobs and their health. But my mom showed me what people can do when they come together for a purpose. When she joined a union and began to make a fair wage, my prospects in life suddenly improved -- and so did those of all the other kids whose parents were in the union. I witnessed the way community organizing can make a difference in real people's lives -- and that may have been one of the most valuable lessons my mother taught me.So this Mother's Day, in honor of my mom Gail Lamkins, I'm going to share this inspiring video. And I'm going to fight harder than ever for a greener and more inclusive America.You can join me. Take a moment to share the \"7 Billion\" video and tell us about a woman who's inspired you. And help our movement grow."}, {"title": "What's In the Name 'Environmentalist'?", "text": "Someone sent me a blog post this morning titled \"Don't call me an environmentalist,\" arguing that \"we need to look beyond the divisions and understand that most of us are on the same side, regardless of the labels we place on ourselves.\" Wouldn't it be great if that were all it took?Here's my response:First, I care less about what people call themselves than which side they're on. In fact, I spend much of my time these days working with people in Alaska who don't consider themselves environmentalists -- and have no aspirations to be. The only thing that matters is whether NRDC opposes the proposed Pebble Mine -- and supports protection of Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery. We do -- and everyone should. But tell that to the mining giants Anglo American and Rio Tinto who, so far, have a very different view.Second, when I hear people imply or suggest that environmentalists don't care enough about people or aren't talking enough about green jobs, I think they must not be listening. NRDC's primary area of focus in terms of staff and resources allocated is addressing climate change, and one of the central and consistently stated arguments in support of our work is the need to create green jobs, promote renewable energy, and protect people.NRDC's largest public campaign at the moment is against the Pebble Mine, and I don't think I ever talk or blog about it without emphasizing the sustainable economy and thousands of good jobs that are put at risk if that project goes forward. I just saw a presentation yesterday by an NRDC colleague leading our fight against the Keystone XL pipeline -- another of NRDC's most high-profile campaigns -- and creating a green energy economy was at the heart of her presentation.Third, the key question for me is not what you call yourself but what is the strategy that will enable us to win. Sometimes the message isn't jobs, even if the reality is that we're on the side of jobs. Here's an example: In our fight against the proposed Mitsubishi salt works at Laguna San Ignacio, NRDC's primary (though not exclusive) messaging focus was the need to protect the whales and their birthing lagoon, but the reality was that we were also defending the lagoon communities and their fisheries -- and protecting a place that people can enjoy forever.The simple fact is that we could not have generated a million petitions against the salt works project by emphasizing the threat posed by the salt works to the region's economy. And, by the way, though we were protecting gray whales in Baja -- or marine mammals all over the world with our Navy sonar litigation -- the lagoon communities' sustainable economic activities, including their fisheries and eco-tourism, have prospered. And even my own kids have gotten more out of going there than just about anything I've ever done for them.And what about the fight against the terrible toll road proposed to be built through the California State Park at San Onofre State Beach? The Coalition in opposition to the project turned out 3,000 people for a California Coastal Commission hearing and 6,000 people for a U.S. Department of Commerce hearing at the Del Mar Fairgrounds -- not because we were fighting for green jobs but because we were fighting to save a state park and world-class surfing beach that serves 2.5 million people a year.Fourth, the reality is that sometimes we can't create the kind of economy we want to create without also stopping bad projects that claim to create jobs but in fact simply perpetuate the kind of carbon-based, waste-based economy that is killing us. Pick your issue: Keystone XL, San Onofre toll road, Gregory Canyon landfill, Deepwater Horizon, 710 Freeway Extension, fuel economy standards, Pebble Mine, greening our ports, fighting poison run-off, Mitsubishi salt works, and on and on. I'd like to think we could just sit around the table with all stakeholders and agree to do the right thing, but my experience has been that it doesn't always work very well.Finally, when I think of environmentalists, I think of just how challenging the work is, how long it takes to prevail, how complex are the strategic choices that need to be made, and how grateful I am for environmental organizations such as NRDC, the Sierra Club, Audubon, the Center for Biological Diversity, and all the others who continue to take on these most difficult battles decade after decade. And I'm grateful for others, too, who may not call themselves environmentalists but are still willing to stand up and work for clean air, clean water, healthy communities, wild spaces, renewable energy, and green jobs.Five hundred years from now this is the work people will care most about that we did for them today."}, {"title": "Plastic Money: Under the Influence of Styrofoam", "text": "There are leaders in San Jose who can put pencil to paper and give us technological wonders to enhance our world tomorrow but who lack the vision to see how banning Styrofoam can enrich our world today.The City of San Jose was set to follow its successful single-use plastic bag ban with a new ban on Styrofoam to-go containers. The citizens had spoken and their local leaders heard them -- so they thought; then something unseemly happened.City officials abandoned the public process; tossed aside months of outreach, workshops and citizen input at eight different \"Green to Go\" meetings; ignored staff reports, recommendations, and cost analysis; and indefinitely delayed a citywide ban on Styrofoam (polystyrene or EPS), to-go food ware.Delaying the citywide ban on Styrofoam is an act of urban cowardice. It is not only a betrayal of the environment, but of the people as well -- people who want to live in healthy communities, people who see this as an issue of environmental justice, and people who believe progressive policies toward the environment and the economy should be coexistent, not competing, interests.San Jose officials are being tight lipped about the details, but what we do know is that DART Container Corporation reportedly offered a $100,000 \"incentive\" to San Jose to stop the citywide ban from going forward. News of this environmental scandal broke in an article by investigative reporter Josh Koehn.Jennifer Garnett, a spokesperson for San Jose's Environmental Services Department, was quoted as saying:We as a staff met with DART, and at that point DART suggested they had a budget of $100,000.But in a November 17, 2011 Memorandum to the City of San Jose Transportation and Environment Committee, Kerrie Romanow, San Jose's Director of Environmental Services, said that a citywide ban on Styrofoam to-go food ware would make a demonstrable improvement in the conditions of San Jose's creeks and neighborhoods by removing one of the most ubiquitous, highly visible, and persistent pollutants from San Jose's waterways and streets; she concluded that recycling is not a viable option for significantly reducing Styrofoam litter.At some point, the veracity of DART's claims and representations about Styrofoam recyclability need to be questioned. How is it good for the environment to perpetuate the presence of Styrofoam to-go containers in our everyday lives?As ocean explorers, advocates, educators, and conservationists, the Cousteau family is influential when it comes to the environment -- a fact that hasn't been lost on the plastic industry, which often quotes Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of the legendary Jacques Cousteau, to persuade the public that bans on products like single-use plastic bags and Styrofoam to-go containers don't work.DART, in particular, takes liberty with Jean-Michel Cousteau's words, disingenuously posting on its website an article written by Cousteau in 2005 with a misleading imprimatur that some might interpret as an endorsement by Cousteau in support of DART's mantra that \"bans don't work.\" But, nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to banning Styrofoam.Cousteau: If Styrofoam is banned we are all better offI asked Jean-Michel Cousteau how he felt about DART, and others in the plastic industry, using his words to oppose local Styrofoam bans like the one proposed for San Jose and statewide legislation like California's SB 568 by Senator Alan Lowenthal. In an exclusive statement, Jean-Michel said this:Regarding my position on the widespread use of Styrofoam, it has come to my attention that some may not clearly comprehend what I wrote about many years ago, or may be interpreting my words for their convenience. In 2005, I pointed out that bans on certain environmentally damaging products like Styrofoam would not change human nature. If the products were available, some people would continue to use them in spite of all the information that the substances caused harm to our precious environment. My viewpoint as expressed in that article remains the same; to successfully and unconditionally prevent the degradation of our environment, we as a people, as a society, must change our ways. Specifically, we must recognize the harm caused by discarding Styrofoam, and stop it.The Mayor of San Jose has expressed skepticism about a citywide Styrofoam ban; he reasons that banning Styrofoam doesn't ultimately reduce the amount of litter, it just changes one kind of litter for another. The Mayor's position parrots the DART corporate line -- a superficial, oversimplified and uninformed argument that ignores the fact that not all litter is created equal.In 2004, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) issued a report to the California Legislature: Use and Disposal of Polystyrene in California. The report documents the unique environmental challenges posed by Styrofoam or polystyrene litter, and the cost to taxpayers to clean up this elusive and pervasive form of litter from our streets and highways; our parks, playgrounds and beaches; our storm drains, creeks and rivers; and ultimately the ocean where Styrofoam and marine debris are notoriously synonymous.Laura Kasa, executive director of Save Our Shores, understands the connection between Styrofoam and marine debris. An active and outspoken proponent of city and countywide Styrofoam bans, Kasa has stated that she intends to do whatever it takes to get San Jose's citywide ban back on the council's agenda. Kasa isn't alone. A recent Mercury News Editorial called on Silicon Valley to do its part to reduce plastic in the ocean, noting that San Jose is positioned as a national leader in this arena, but that it can do more.Fighting \"big plastic\" at the state level is a David versus Goliath struggle but it shouldn't be that way at the local level. City Councils and Boards of Supervisors represent the best chance for citizens to petition their government on a fair, honest and level playing field.How much did the San Jose City Council know about DART before considering this deal? Were they aware that last year the Sacramento County District Attorney launched an investigation of DART for \"greenwashing\" claims about the recyclability of its Styrofoam cups? According to one news report, the district attorney said that DART's recycling claims violated Federal Trade Commission guidelines and California Law.Did Mayor Reed's staff do its homework? Was the Mayor told that Kenneth and Robert C. Dart, the brothers who own the DART Container Corporation, renounced their United States Citizenship and moved offshore to avoid paying taxes? Profit over patriotism -- is that of any consequence to the Mayor, a veteran, Air Force Academy graduate, and father of a daughter who serves our country and risks her life defending our flag as a decorated fighter pilot?Is DART really the type of role model San Jose wants to be in \"partnership\" with?Maybe San Jose didn't take DART's money, but it clearly had an undue influence on city officials, causing them to do exactly what DART wanted -- stop the public process of enacting a citywide Styrofoam ban. Bringing transparency and sunshine to city hall is a cornerstone of the administration of Mayor Reed, who promised the citizens of San Jose honesty and open government:It is important for San Jos\u00e9 residents to have confidence in their government. The special interest groups, the lobbyists, the influence peddlers, and the fixers will not run City Hall.Good intentions are meaningless, and words of honesty and integrity ring hollow, without actions to back them up.

It's not just the nine months of pregnancy or even the delivery; it's the commitment that goes with nurturing a child and providing for its future. And if the child does not return the mother's love, it becomes a thankless job. Just ask Mother Earth.For four and a half billion years Mother Earth has been doing her best to nurture life, but it's not easy being a single mom, even when you're a planet. For the first couple billion years, conceiving was impossible. Literally. Molten temperatures and a toxic atmosphere made it pretty tough to string together the nucleic acids and conditions that would make life possible, but with a little help from water-laden comets, Mother Earth finally got the job done, and about 600 million years ago complex life forms finally emerged.Still, it's been tough. Making plant life abundant required the slow accumulation of topsoil. For animal life to prosper, more oxygen in the atmosphere was required. Then, just when life was flourishing, a comet crashed into the Earth and caused a mass extinction. And now Mother is struggling to support 7 billion humans, the most affluent of which are rapidly depleting the Earth's resources, and the poorest of which are struggling desperately to survive.To make matters worse, Mother Earth is having to deal with another mass extinction. Climate change, loss of habitat, invasive species and other factors are hastening the loss of plant and wildlife. And caring for those 7 billion humans is not getting any easier either. Droughts, flooding, water shortages, desertification, and the continuing loss of topsoil are putting a strain on Mother's ability to feed a growing world population.And you think raising a couple of kids is hard.There are a lot of things that we could do to make life easier for Mother Earth, such as curbing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving crucial bio-habitats, reducing pollution, and stopping the over-fishing of the oceans.But here's a Mother's Day thought: we can also help Mother Earth by taking better care of mothers.If we meet the UN's goal of ensuring universal access to family planning and reproductive health services, there will be fewer unintended pregnancies and projected population growth rates will fall, easing the strain on Mother Earth. The unmet need for family planning is large. Even in the U.S., almost half of all pregnancies are unintended. In the developing world, the UN estimates that there are 215 million women who want to avoid a pregnancy, but who are not using a modern method of contraception.By providing women with better access to contraceptives and reproductive health services, we not only lower birth rates; we reduce maternal mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa, a woman has a 1 in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth, and in areas where child marriage is still prevalent, the rate of adolescent pregnancies is actually rising. Even if young girls survive giving birth, they can still suffer severe medical complications.A recent one-hour documentary, Mother: Caring for 7 Billion, does a marvelous job of drawing the not-so-obvious connection between caring for mothers and caring for Mother Earth. It's a powerful and hopeful message, and in celebration of mothers worldwide, the producers of the film are streaming it for free from their website this Mother's Day at www.motherthefilm.com .Our mothers, including Mother Earth, have done their best to nurture and care for us.

And even if that fortified microbe isn't capable of causing illness in humans itself, scientists add, its DNA could find its way into the more malignant microbes in the environment.\"Antibiotic resistance is likely the biggest public health challenge that we'll be facing this century,\" said Amy Pruden, an expert on antibiotic resistance at Virginia Tech. \"We're in a state of complacency right now. We count on antibiotics working for us, but they are slowly starting to lose their effectiveness.\"While progress has been made in the clinical realm -- limiting unnecessary uses of antibiotics, for example, and encouraging patients to take the full course of their prescribed drugs -- Pruden noted \"mounting evidence that the environment is another important piece of the puzzle.\"Drug residues and bacteria with drug-resistant genes can pass together through a human's or animal's gut and into the environment, even if the living contaminants take a detour through a wastewater treatment plant.In a study published on Tuesday, Scottish researchers found that relatively low concentrations of antibiotics in certain environments -- such as river sediments, swine feces lagoons and farmed soil -- may be enough to speed along the proliferation of the drug-resistant genes. It's another survival-of-the-fittest story: Bacteria that can withstand the drugs will survive and reproduce, while their antibiotic-susceptible counterparts die out.The winning genes then have the potential to infiltrate drinking water or produce, which increases human exposure and raises the likelihood that the genes will spread.\"Antibiotic resistance is such a big global health concern,\" said Alfredo Tello of the University of Stirling, lead researcher on the study. \"We need to consider the effect that antibiotics released into the environment can have on development of this resistance.\"Adding to the danger is the fact that bacteria can easily swap genes with each other. A bacterium that passes through the intestines into the local waterway, for example, may not itself be a pathogen that normally threatens human health, but that benign bug can share its drug-tolerating secrets.\"It's not necessarily important what species is holding on to the DNA as long as the DNA is held on to and propagated,\" explained David Cummings, a biologist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. \"Then it can later be released to cause disease in an animal, plant or human.\"Cummings' own research has identified dangerous DNA in the river sediments around San Diego and across the Mexican border into Tijuana.\"These coastal wetland habitats are becoming sinks and ultimately sources for drug-resistant bacteria -- more importantly, sinks for the DNA that provide resistance,\" said Cummings, who points his finger at pet waste, bird feces, leaky sewer pipes and hospital waste effluent as the likely culprits in the San Diego area, which is home to few livestock operations. \"We've tinkered with a lot of resistance genes, and anything we look for, we find.\"A separate study published last month also emphasized the importance of oft-overlooked aquatic sources of antibiotic resistance. Canadian researchers analyzed four different bodies of water affected by varying levels of human activity. They found resistance genes at all four sites, although the intensity varied: A harbor hosting sewer overflows suffered from higher levels than a nature preserve.\"Antibiotic resistance is widespread in aquatic environments ranging from heavily impacted urban sites to remote areas,\" Lesley Warren of McMaster University in Canada, and the lead researcher on the study, said in a statement. \"The presence of environmental bacterial communities in aquatic environments represents a significant, largely unknown source of antibiotic resistance.\"What's more, antibiotic residue and resistance genes may be spread farther and more widely by wildlife, particularly seabirds. Researchers at the University of Miami recently found a large number of seagulls and pelicans were host to bacteria associated with broad-spectrum resistance to infectious bugs, such as the E. coli that causes urinary tract infections in women.It is becoming increasingly evident that the world's dire antibiotic-resistance problem involves a lot of players, all acting through a variety of complicated means. So what should be done?\"The solutions need to come from upstream, figuratively and literally,\" said Cummings. \"That can be public education, improving our wastewater management and treatment -- even something as simple, albeit expensive, as separating stormwater from the sewage system.\" The latter would limit the untreated sewage flowing into waterways.Of course, excrement from livestock is subject to even looser waste management practices than human waste.The use of antibiotics in livestock is the subject of ongoing debate. According to the latest estimates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 80 percent of the country's antibiotics are given to food animals, predominantly for the purpose of promoting growth or preventing disease, rather than for treating illness.Also published this Tuesday was a study implicating the widespread use of antibiotics in swine feed. Not only do antibiotic-resistant genes end up in the soil and wastewater around the feedlots, but researchers suggest the genes are often spread further by the application of the waste on crop lands.In response to the growing concerns, the FDA released contentious guidelines last month that ask pork, beef and poultry producers to choose to stop using antibiotics for fattening up their livestock. As The Huffington Post reported in March, the agency has also been ordered by a federal court to follow through on a rule proposed in 1977 that would withdraw approvals for most non-therapeutic uses of penicillin and tetracyclines in livestock, drugs particularly crucial in human medicine.\"Every time you use antibiotics, you can select for resistance,\" said Gail Hansen, senior officer with the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming. \"When giving them to healthy animals for no reason other than to get them to grow faster or compensate for unhygienic conditions, you're adding to that.\"\"The new research,\" added Hansen, \"really points out that antibiotics aren't just affecting the bacteria while they're inside the pig.\""}, {"title": "EPA's Fracking Rules Cover Only A Sliver Of Land", "text": "ProPublica's Lena Groeger Reports:Last week\u2019s media coverage of the Obama administration\u2019s newly-proposed fracking rules focused so heavily on how drilling companies would have to disclose the chemicals they use that it largely overlooked the toughest provisions: Drillers would be required to test the physical integrity of their wells, and more water would be protected from drilling. Since many wells fail because the cement and casings crack, the new tests could prevent dangerous leakages.One major limitation: Although widely understood as \u201cnational\u201d guidelines, the draft rules would in fact only apply to a sliver of the nation\u2019s natural gas supply. That\u2019s because they would apply to mineral rights managed by the Bureau of Land Management, which means areas beneath most BLM and tribal land, but scarcely any U.S. Forest Service, private or state-owned lands \u2013 where most drilling occurs. Industry has criticized the proposed rules as too restrictive.The draft rules would require companies to conduct \u201cmechanical integrity tests.\u201d These include pressure tests to make sure that the well can withstand the highly pressurized fluid used for fracking. Ensuring that wells are properly sealed is considered critical for preventing water and ground contamination.The proposed rules also expand the scope of water protected from drilling to include not just fresh water but all \u201cusable water\u201d \u2013 meaning lower quality water used for agriculture and construction, as well as water that can be treated to make potable. Currently, only water with up to 5,000 parts per million of total dissolved solids is protected by the BLM. The new rules would expand that definition to include water with up to 10,000 parts per million, which matches the EPA\u2019s definition for an underground source of drinking water.\u201cThe proposed rule will modernize our management of well stimulation activities \u2013 including hydraulic fracturing \u2013 to make sure that fracturing operations conducted on public and Indian lands follow common-sense industry best practices,\u201d Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a statement.The lands covered by the proposed rules are the source of \u201c11 percent of the Nation\u2019s natural gas supply and five percent of its oil,\u201d according to the BLM. About 3,400 wells are drilled on these lands each year, according to the bureau, and 90 percent of those wells use hydraulic fracturing, a technique to extract natural gas by injecting into the earth highly pressurized fluids laden with chemicals, sometimes including potentially toxic ones such as benzene and lead.Environmental activists wonder how likely the rules are to be enforced. In New Mexico, for example, the BLM oversees more than 30,000 active wells \u00ad\u2013 with only 69 inspectors. \u201cHowever strong the rules are, enforcement is only as good as staff on the ground,\u201d said attorney Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Western Environmental Law Center.Environmentalists also lambasted a provision that would require companies to disclose the chemicals they use to frack on some public lands. At issue was timing: The draft rule would allow companies to complete drilling before they make public the chemicals they had injected into the ground. Although some drilling companies report the chemicals they use to online public registries, they are not always required to do so. Many drillers claim that disclosure would amount to revealing \u201ctrade secrets.\u201dThe timing of disclosure matters. Landowners who want to see if a nearby well is polluting their land or water need a baseline assessment of chemicals that are present before drilling. If they don\u2019t know the chemicals the company will inject, the only way to get a baseline reading is to test for a vast number of chemicals, an expensive and impractical undertaking.\u201cKnowing after the fact is nice, but does not allow for any steps to be taken if the chemicals being used are of concern to the public. I urge the Interior Department to strengthen this rule,\u201d Congressman Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) said in a statement. Hinchey co-authored national legislation to give the EPA the power to monitor all fracking activities in the U.S., which under current law the agency cannot regulate.The proposed disclosure rules would not demand much more than the standards some states already have in place. For example Colorado and Wyoming have large swaths of public lands targeted by the draft rules, but they already have disclosure regulations that are equally stringent, if not more so, than the federal proposal. Colorado requires that companies disclose the chemicals they use in addition to their concentrations within 60 days of fracking activities. Wyoming requires disclosure of chemicals both before and after fracking, although its regulation has been criticized for not making all of those disclosures public.\u201cIt seems like BLM has looked at state rules as a ceiling, not as a floor, for what should be done,\u201d said attorney Schlenker-Goodrich, who charged that the administration was putting forward \u201chalf-measures.\u201dIndustry charges that the rules would slow down drilling too much. The Independent Petroleum Association of America and ExxonMobil did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the IPAA head Barry Russell told Reuters that the rules will \u201cwill undoubtedly insert an unnecessary layer of rigidity into the permitting and development process.\u201dOnce the draft rule is published in the Federal Register, the BLM will take comments for 60 days before it finalizes the rule."}, {"title": "Autism and Chemicals, Cancer Report Under Fire and Kudos!", "text": "What causes autism?

South Korea is the world\u2019s eighth largest emitter of carbon pollution from fossil fuel burning so this is an important signal from one of the world\u2019s largest players. This program would mark an important step in South Korea following through on the commitment it made in Copenhagen to cut its global warming pollution to 4 percent below 2005 levels. This announcement follows on the heels of the passage of national global warming legislation in Mexico.The legislation is set to go into effect in 2015 and would cap the carbon pollution from power plants, steel plants, ship makers, and large universities. The final details are still to be worked out, but the latest draft regulations would:While South Korean industry is reportedly strongly opposed to the legislation (according to Reuters and Bloomberg), the South Korean government forged ahead with the program anyway. This program will help spur more efficiency in the country and greater deployment of renewable energy. Wind, solar, and geothermal account for less than 1 percent of the total electricity produced in the country \u2013 ranking them number 15 out of all the G20 countries.

The solution is to give space to the rival tendency in human nature, which is to take charge of costs, when the costs affect one's home. So my book is an exploration of the motive that I call 'oikophilia,' the love of home. The propensity for settlement and stewardship is at the heart of conservative philosophy, I argue, and ought to be at the heart of conservative politics too.But what about climate change? This question is the first that I am asked by all those on the left to whom I try to explain my views, and it is a fair question. Here is a problem that cannot be solved by local action. There is nothing that I and my neighbours, or even I and my nation, can do to rectify a problem that affects the entire earth, and which can never be cured in some local part of it. Surely, therefore, there is no solution, other than a radical change of lifestyle, imposed by international treaty and enforced across the globe?As soon as you put it that way, however, the doubts arise. Politicians in democracies don't sign treaties that will commit their voters to unacceptable changes in their way of life. What is the point of signing a treaty if you lose the election that would enable you to enforce it? Politicians in autocratic states sign treaties willy-nilly, but only because nobody is in a position to hold them to the deal. If the globe-trotting in search of a climate-change treaty is what environmental politics amounts to, then we can be forgiven for thinking that it is nothing more than conscience-washing by the political class.There is a tendency on the libertarian right to dismiss the entire environmental agenda, and to give credence to those scientists who argue either that global warming is a myth, or that it is not caused by human action and therefore not curable by human action. I don't go along with that, although, like most people who consider these questions, I am a mere amateur when it comes to the science. It stands to reason that the earth will get warmer, if the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is constantly rising. So how do we change? To penalize the use of fossil fuels when these are the principal, or the only, source of energy is impossible. People will not accept to use less energy than they need, and in any case large-scale political initiatives always need more energy, not less.There are two solutions: to find a source of clean energy that can be made freely available around the globe, or to embark on some work of geo-engineering that will counter the effect of carbon emissions. The second of those is so controversial that no politician will touch it. But the first has given rise to a spate of unreal and environmentally damaging solutions, such as the craze for wind farms, whose largely symbolic contribution to the grid is more than offset by the damage that they inflict on our shared sense of stewardship. Why care for the environment, if the price of doing so is the loss of an environment that you could care for? Besides, wind farms always need that other, more reliable, and more polluting source of energy, which comes, in the German case, by plugging in to the French nuclear-powered grid. The depths of hypocrisy here need no comment.The French are surely right to rely on nuclear power. There are risks, but the management of risk is what the environmental question is all about. Meanwhile we should face the facts: the problem of clean energy is first and foremost a scientific problem. It will be solved by well-funded scientists working in an atmosphere of free enquiry. In other words, it will emerge in a wealthy and democratic nation state, and can only be hampered by devoting our resources to futile treaty-mongering.

Choi, OurAmazingPlanet Contributor:The earthquake and tsunami that rocked Chile in 2010 unleashed substantial and surprising changes on ecosystems there, yielding insights on how these natural disasters can affect life and how sea level rise might affect the world, researchers say.The magnitude 8.8 earthquake that hit Chile struck off an area of the coast where 80 percent of the population lives. The massive quake triggered a tsunami reaching about 30 feet (10 meters) high that wreaked havoc on coastal communities: It killed more than 500 people, injured about 12,000 more, and damaged or destroyed at least 370,000 houses.It makes sense that such earthshaking catastrophes would have drastic consequences on ecosystems in the affected areas. However, if researchers lack enough data about the environment before a disaster strikes, as is usually the case, it can be difficult to decipher these effects. With the 2010 Chile quake, scientists were able to conduct an unprecedented report of its ecological implications based on data collected on coastal ecosystems shortly before and up to 10 months after the event.The sandy beaches of Chile apparently experienced significant and lasting changes because of the earthquake and tsunami. The responses of ecosystems there depended strongly on the amount of land level change, how mobile life there was, the type of shoreline, and the degree of human alteration of the coast. For instance, in places where the beaches sank and did not have manmade sea walls and other artificial \"coastal armoring\" to keep water out, intertidal animal populations \u2014 ones living in the part of the seashore that is covered at high tide and uncovered at low tide \u2014 all dropped, presumably because their habitats were submerged.The most unexpected results came from uplifted sandy beaches. Previously, intertidal species had been kept from these beaches due to coastal armoring. After the earthquake, these species rapidly colonized the new stretch of beach the quake raised up in front of the sea walls.\"This is the first time this has been seen before,\"said researcher Eduardo Jaramillo, a coastal ecologist at the Southern University of Chile.\"Plants are coming back in places where there haven't been plants, as far as we know, for a very long time,\" said researcher Jenny Dugan, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"This is not the initial ecological response you might expect from a major earthquake and tsunami.\"These findings could help inform future human alterations to coastlines. For instance, as sea levels rise globally, it might be wise to consider how beach habitats in front of sea walls might get changed.\"Around the Pacific coast, there may be another earthquake tomorrow, the day past tomorrow, we don't know,\" Jaramillo told OurAmazingPlanet. \"With this kind of research, hopefully we can learn something from them.\" [7 Ways Earth Changes in Blink of an Eye]The scientists detailed their findings online May 2 in the journal PLoS ONE.Follow OurAmazingPlanet for the latest in Earth science and exploration news on Twitter @OAPlanet and on Facebook.Copyright 2012 OurAmazingPlanet, a TechMediaNetwork company.

The Australian-born medical doctor (a pediatrician) and former Nobel Peace Prize nominee is the author of five books and the founder of several organizations including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Women's Action for New Directions (WAND) and The Helen Caldicott Foundation/NuclearFreePlanet.org. I recently had the opportunity to talk to the world renowned activist and environmental prophet at Green America's Green Festival in New York City, where she delivered an urgent and electrifying speech. Dr. Caldicott, who has been outspoken about the health and environmental dangers of nuclear power since before the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl meltdowns, prays that we will take heed from the recent Fukushima nuclear disaster, which resulted in the Japanese government shutting down all 54 of Japan's nuclear reactors, and spark a global trend to close nuclear power plants. Her frustration and anger at the lack of meaningful progress on this issue is palpable; as is her inspiring hope and belief in the collective power of individual citizens to raise their voices and create the political will to take action. What's at stake, as she reminds us in this candid interview, is our moral and spiritual imperative to protect our children and our Mother Earth. As she bluntly puts it, \" The planet's in the intensive care unit, critically, acutely ill, and now we are all physicians to a dying planet.\" She urges, \"Let the data sink in and then get off your couches to save the planet for your children.\"Marianne Schnall: What is the one message you are most hoping to get out there?Helen Caldicott: There isn't one message, there are three. One is that we are in dire danger from global warming and that unless we pull our socks up and stop burning coal and stop driving our SUV's around doing five miles to the gallon and stop fracking and natural gas, we're doomed. The temperature is on the way to be three degrees centigrade hotter by the middle of the century, which is almost antithetical to human existence, and six degrees by the end of the century - this is the top leading scientific data now that is available. I mean, we're killing the earth! Overtly. And we don't love our children enough, because if we did, we would be taking the necessary steps to stop burning coal and saving energy, you know?When you think, that the Japanese had 54 reactors and now they've got none, they're all closed down, I think except one, I'm not sure. I think the last one is being closed. They're not dying - well of course, they will be dying soon of cancer and leukemia from the accident, but they're surviving alright without...

We live at the same temperature like a Jello, the whole year. So you come to New York in the summer, it's hot and you go into a theater - it's like being in a refrigerator! Or in the winter, the buildings are so hot you'd have to take your clothes off. Well, what about putting on a lot of clothes in the winter - I mean, there are so many ways to go. And I do believe Americans desperately want to do the right thing, they're really good people, but they're just really not informed about what is happening. So inform yourselves. Read all my books. Question. Let the data sink in and then get off your couches to save the planet for your children. I mean, why immunize children and why care about what they eat, if, in fact, they don't have a future! It really amazes me. Number two: you close down your two Indian Point reactors, because if one of them blows, man - you're all gone. Three: work with Obama to work with Russia to abolish 97% of the weapons on the planet, between Russia and America. You can do that. The Russians are ready. What's holding it up is your generals, who are really pathological in the Pentagon and one of them said, 'If you get rid of our nuclear weapons, man, that's threatening the family jewels,' and that says it all, in a nutshell, so to speak, and that's a bad pun.  Marianne Schnall: When you look at the human species right now and the evolution of our consciousness, what do you think is at the root of our inability to act on any of this?HC: You know, we did stop slavery and women got the vote and we've done all sorts of wonderful things, we are capable of growth, but we're still kind of tribal. After 9/11, this country turned into a tribe seeking vengeance. And I was in Eau Claire, Wisconsin the morning it happened, I had just flown in from Australia. It was a very Christian campus. So I got out the Bible and I looked at Luke, not that I'm a Christian. I'm a Pantheist. And Jesus said, love thine enemies, do good to those who hate you - and I hoped that America would not seek vengeance, the most powerful, destructive country on Earth. Well, I caught the Greyhound bus three days later and the country was swathed in flags and outside every mom and pop store it said 'God Bless America' and I thought, oh God. So \"W\" went into Iraq and killed a million people, half of whom were children, using uranium weapons and there's a very high incidence of severe congenital anomalies now, where those weapons were used in Basra and Fallujah, such that babies are being born with no brains, no arms, single eyes and so severe is it that the doctors have told the women to stop having babies. You were conducting a nuclear war there because some people went into the World Trade towers. Why didn't you stop and think, now why did they go into the World Trade Center? What have you done to alarm people so much that they would be, in their craziness, willing to do that, or fly into your Indian Point reactors? So America needs to grow up. And especially you need to grow up because you are the most militarily powerful country on earth and people really are kind in America and they really, desperately want to do the right thing, but without being educated, through the media, they don't know what it is. And the media, therefore, is determining the fate of the earth. As Marshall McLuhan said, \"The media is the message.\"MS: Do you feel hopeful? Are you optimistic that we're going to be able to...HC: No, I'm not optimistic about the media, at all.MS: About the situation generally?HC: I am. I mean, I've got the cure to global warming, which is a study that I commissioned called Carbon-Free and Nuclear-Free. Download it at www.ieer.org. You've got enough renewable energy right now, right now - integrated forms supply all the energy you need, right now - well, by 2030 - but get going and you'll employ millions of people and it will be terribly exciting. And lead the world towards a carbon-free nuclear-free future. We can abolish nuclear weapons. Obama wants to. He said in his speech in Prague, \"I need your help\" - and no one stepped up to the plate to support him. So he's on his own, fighting those crazy generals in the Pentagon who see the missiles as a surrogate for their erectile disability. That's why I called my book, years ago, Missile Envy. I mean, that's how they talk! They do.The other thing is you can close down all the reactors if you rise up off your couches and you do what the people in Wisconsin did - take over your Congress. It belongs to you. Occupy it. It is yours. You are the leaders and those Representatives are your representatives. The President is not your leader. You're his leaders. And if you leave a vacuum there by not going in and making sure your representatives do what you want, the corporations step in and fill the vacuum and then you've got a corporate plutocracy and they're all corporate prostitutes, except maybe Bernie Sanders. So, you know, it's kind of your fault that it's happening, kind of your fault. And I think the Occupy movement has great potential. I think what happened in Wisconsin was so exciting. And when I went to Zuccotti Park in November or whenever, it was such a feeling of hope! For the first time in 20 years. You've got to rise up! You've got to take control of your country. You've got to get rid of those blasted corporations, who are evil! They're evil. They're killing the earth! And they know. I once spoke to a man who was building cruise missiles and I said, 'What about your children?' And he looked at me with eyes like dead stones and he said, 'I'm making money.' I said, 'Yeah, but what about your children?' And he repeated it. But when those men are on their death bed, they recant and they tell me what they've done. But it's too late, because they're about to die. Because they know, inside, what the truth is.MS: Last question. What is your wish for the children of the future?HC: That we have the courage to save their lives! I'm a pediatrician. I took the Hippocratic Oath. The planet's in the intensive care unit, critically, acutely ill, and now we are all physicians to a dying planet. And if we don't have the commitment and dedication that we have when we've got a patient in the ICU, and we stay up all night with them. We don't even think about ourselves. We're so tired out, we can hardly walk. We feel nauseated with tiredness. But that commitment is appropriate now and it's the only thing that's going to save the earth.For more information visit:ifyoulovethisplanet.org nuclearfreeplanet.org helencaldicott.comMarianne Schnall is a widely published writer and interviewer whose writings and interviews have appeared in a variety of media outlets.

Questions may be edited for length and clarity.Any time-saving tips for us eco-minded moms? I try my best to go green, but lately I feel so overwhelmed that I have a hard time even remembering to take out the recycling bin!--ErinFor the first several months after my daughter was born, I put on a good show. I learned how to fold cloth diapers into absorbent little angel wings and made my own baby wipes. I tucked the babe into a sling and lugged canvas bags of vegetables from the farmers market. I whipped up organic dinners every night from scratch. I soaked beans. I breastfed.I also worked from home, conducting phone interviews as my daughter snoozed on my shoulder or writing while she bounced in her baby chair. It wasn't easy to \"do it all\" (especially since my husband had to go back to his long houred job a week after she was born), but it was manageable. Or maybe I was just hopped up on new-mom adrenaline.Then my daughter turned six months old and began crawling.And teething, which meant what little sleep I had had went out the window. And eating solid foods (making baby purees was time-consuming; cleaning the diapers was a nightmare). Every day felt like a giant hamster wheel. I couldn't remember a night when I wasn't slicing and steaming and scrubbing and feeding up until I collapsed in bed.In the words of Chinua Achebe, things fell apart.I don't remember my exact breaking point, but it was around the time our building's washing machine broke for the umpteenth time and I had to schlep soiled diapers to the laundromat three times a week. (My daughter was in the sling for that, too. Fun!)Our lifestyle may have been green, but it certainly wasn't sustainable; something would have to give. Here this was only my first child, and I worked from home! How did moms with more kids, moms with full-time jobs go green without going crazy?I have two words for you: Time management.

The plan is to be deployed by a shadowy network of propaganda contractors like the disgraced Heartland Institute, who recently compared those who accept the mainstream science on climate change to mass murderers, and was prepared by a fellow of the American Tradition Institute (ATI), the same law-breaking group that is suing climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann to gain access to his personal papers and emails while at the University of Virginia.If anyone doubts there is a well-coordinated, well-funded assault on science in America that is designed to fool people, look no further than this plan.The confidential strategy memo advises using \"subversion\" to build a national movement of people protesting wind farms.Sound silly? Any time money is behind a science issue it can become politicized. Consider 1920s Germany. Right-wing activists put money behind the crazy idea that Einstein's special theory of relativity would lead to moral decay. They called it \"Jewish science\" and \"a hoax\" and said Einstein was in it for the money. Sound familiar?\"This world is a strange madhouse,\" Einstein wote a friend at the time. \"Currently every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct. Belief in this matter depends on political party affiliation.\"The ATI propaganda plan was discussed at a meeting of 30 of these so-called 'wind warriors,' hand-picked by the plan's author, ATI senior fellow John Droz Jr., in Washington D.C. last February.\"These documents show for the first time that local Nimby (Not In My Back Yard) anti-wind groups are co-ordinating and working with national fossil-fuel funded advocacy groups to wreck the wind industry,\" said Gabe Elsner,  co-director of Checks and Balances, the accountability group which unearthed the proposal, in an interview with the Guardian.The propaganda campaign calls for a national PR effort to cause \"subversion in message of industry so that it effectively becomes so bad that no one wants to admit in public they are for it.\"This is similar to the strategy used to demolish \"cap and trade,\" turning it into a epithet during the 2010 climate bill debate in Congress. This \"concept murder\" happened to the dismay of conservative economists like former George W. Bush chief economic advisor Doug Holtz-Eakin, who saw cap and trade, which was invented by conservatives, as the best conservative tool to battle top-down, command-and-control environmental regulations. Holtz-Eakin says conservatives have forgotten that, and lost their roots. \"They've taken positions that are divorced from any reality on the policy and from their own history,\" he told me. \"We don't want to go back to the old, big-government approach of one size fits all of the 1970s,\" he said. \"Conservatives need to figure out what they stand for. Is it just the highest bidder, or are there principles in there that mean something? I've always felt it's in their political interest to not deny the science, that's where the votes of the future are.\"The propaganda plan goes much further than cap-and-trade opponents did in its efforts to fool the American public. It suggests creating \"dummy businesses\" to purchase billboards, much like the recent notorious Heartland Institute billboard, which was featured on Clear Channel space.The plan also suggests creating a \"counter-intelligence branch\" to track the wind energy industry, and it recommends spending $750,000 to create a 501(c)(3) \"nonprofit\" with paid staff, much like the Heartland Institute, ATI, Americand for Prosperity, and other propaganda mouthpieces for the energy industry, and is dedicated to \"constructively influence national and state wind energy policies\" by building public opposition to the wind energy industry.Subversion, propaganda, and fooling the public are nothing new to ATI's associates. During the 2010 elections, the Montana Commission of Political Practices found that ATI's parent organization, WTP/ATP, broke state campaign laws by failing to register as a political committee or report its donors and spending.The state suggested WTP/ATP was involved in corruption and money laundering. They found that it solicited unlimited contributions to support candidates and then passed them through a \"sham organization,\" similar to the \"dummy businesses\" suggested in the new propaganda plan. The sham organization was the Bozeman-based political action committee The Coalition for Energy and the Environment that ran attack ads against Democrats. WTP told corporations that it aimed to combat \"radical environmentalists\" and \"beat them at their own game\" and that their contributions would remain secret. This view is similar to the radicalized view of mainstream scientists, federal science agencies, and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences adopted by the Heartland Institute, who compared them on its widely discredited billboards to \"murderers and madmen.\"The propaganda plan says its \"broader possible goal is to constructively influence national and state energy and environmental policies.\"Get Shawn Lawrence Otto's new book: Fool Me Twice: Fighting the Assault on Science in America, \"One of the most important books written in America in the last decade.\" Starred Kirkus Review; Starred Publishers Weekly review.

Other animals suffered from rectal and uterine prolapses.Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of HSUS, described on a press call how one pig was forced to give birth on a set date. \"The worker intended to stick his arm in the animal's uterus to pull out the piglets, but instead went into her anus and caused the prolapse there. This animal lived another 11 days in this condition,\" he said.According to HSUS, the farm is owned by Denver-based Itoham America Inc., which HSUS says sells to Tyson Foods, the world\u2019s second largest meat processor. Itoham America could not be reached by phone.Last week, HSUS said, it notified local authorities of the alleged abuse and urged the Platte County sheriff\u2019s office to pursue criminal charges. The sheriff's office did not return HuffPost's request for comment, but Pacelle said he was \"very pleased with their interest and their degree of scrutiny.\"Wyoming Premium Farms' website states that its facilities \"consist of a breeding farm housing over 5,000 sows, a nursery and two finishers with capacity to finish all pigs, feedmill to mix all feed required and a corporate office.\" The farms were established in 1995 \"with the purpose of producing healthy pigs in a clean environment.\" The company did not return requests for comment.Tyson Foods spokesman Worth Sparkman emailed a statement to HuffPost, saying the company was \"appalled\" by the video and denying any connection between the Wyoming farm and the pork processed by Tyson. \"Tyson Foods does not buy any of the hogs raised on this farm for our pork processing plants. We do have a small, but separate hog buying business that buys aged sows; however, these animals are subsequently sold to other companies and are not used in Tyson\u2019s pork processing business,\" the statement said.Sparkman clarified in a follow-up email: \"A company that we own has purchased hogs from the farm. We will not purchase from this farm until we've had a chance to investigate.\"The original statement also says that all hog suppliers selling to Tyson must be certified by the pork industry\u2019s Pork Quality Assurance Plus program, adding, \"Farms that do not conform will be eliminated from our supply chain.\"In April, HSUS filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, arguing that the National Pork Producers Council's public descriptions of that quality assurance program make false claims and constitute deceptive advertising.   The National Pork Producers Council hit back on its website, saying, \"The FTC complaint is the latest attack by animal-rights activists on America's hog farmers, an assault that seems obviously in response to the U.S. pork industry's strident opposition to congressional legislation that would allow federal bureaucrats to tell farmers how to raise and care for their animals.\"To address both the specific alleged abuse at Wyoming Premium Farms and broader issues of animal welfare, Pacelle said, the pork industry should abandon the use of gestation crates -- small enclosures in which sows are kept during pregnancy -- and local law enforcement should vigorously enforce anti-cruelty laws.McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Safeway and Burger King have all declared a goal of ridding gestation crates from their supply chains. Smithfield Foods, Hormel and Cargill are also making efforts to lower the number of company-owned operations using the devices. According to HSUS, eight U.S. states have passed laws to phase out gestation crates.More generally, no federal law protects farm animals from cruelty while they are on farms, and some states exempt farm animals from their anti-cruelty laws. HSUS Chief Counsel Jonathan Lovvorn told HuffPost that Wyoming's law falls somewhere in the middle among anti-cruelty statutes. \"The state's anti-cruelty statute applies to all animals, which is why the HSUS has asked local law enforcement to prosecute animal cruelty,\" he said, adding, \"What we've seen on this video is animal cruelty by virtually any state's definition -- the intentional kicking, throwing, stomping, beating of animals for the purpose of inflicting pain and suffering.\"Earlier this year, HSUS filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FTC after another undercover investigation suggested mistreatment at a pig breeding facility linked to Walmart. In an unrelated incident this year, Whole Foods severed ties with a hatchery after Compassion Over Killing's undercover video showed alleged abuse, although the company wouldn't say whether its decision was based on the abuse allegations.The use of such videos to reveal abuses at factory farms is threatened. In March, Iowa made it illegal to gain access to a farm facility under false pretenses, and other states have considered similar laws.\"If those laws existed [in Wyoming],\" Lovvorn argued, \"the cruelty at this facility would have continued forever with no public knowledge, no law enforcement and no remedial action.\""}, {"title": "Occupy Bank Of America Protest Foreshadows Democratic Convention", "text": "Dozens of good-government groups, Occupy Wall Street contingents, environmental activists, struggling homeowners and institutional investors are descending on Charlotte, N.C., to protest Wednesday's Bank of America shareholders' meeting. Occupiers characterize the event as a test run for activism targeting September's Democratic National Convention, and expect thousands of protesters for a full day of marches and theatrics criticizing what they say are the Charlotte-based bank's consumer abuses and political power.The widening of income inequality and growing corporate influence on governing have sown disillusionment among parts of the Democratic Party base, including Occupiers, much as the Vietnam War demoralized the Democratic base in the '60s. The tension climaxed in during the 1968 convention in Chicago, with a police crackdown still remembered as a pivotal event in 20th century American politics.Charlotte authorities may not have the brutal reputation of Chicago's Democratic Daley family that ordered the assaults on protesters. But today's organizers note that Charlotte authorities are already cracking down on dissent.In fact, the arrests have already begun. On Monday, three activists were taken into police custody for carrying a banner criticizing the bank, according to organizers who discussed the matter on a Tuesday call with reporters. The city of Charlotte has authorized a broad array of unconventional police powers for the bank shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the preemptive crackdown for permitting the arrest of anyone carrying a backpack, purse or briefcase with the intent to conceal anything on a long list of prohibited items, ranging from weapons to markers to bicycle helmets. Those same police powers will be in effect for September's DNC Convention.\"Part of it is testing those out,\" explained Tammy Shapiro, an activist with Occupy Wall Street. She came to Charlotte from New York City to participate in the protests. She called the new police powers \"ludicrous.\" \"There's the sense that we are going to challenge what these laws are.\"The new police powers were authorized by a City Council ordinance earlier this year that also banned camping in Charlotte, effectively razing the Occupy Charlotte community.Tim Liszewski, an activist from Occupy Columbia in South Carolina who plans to protest Bank of America Wednesday, said any arrests may serve as a way to challenge those police powers in court. \"It might be that when you go up there you can get some lawsuits going to invalidate the restrictions,\" he said. He added that he's not planning on getting arrested. But \"if it happens, I certainly will challenge the law.\"City of Charlotte spokeswoman Kim McMillan insisted that the city's goal is not to prevent the exercise of free speech, but to ensure that protesters are safe and businesses can operate normally.Inside the Bank of America meeting, disgruntled shareholders including Trillium Asset Management, the City of New York and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees will force votes on proposals that would curb the bank's political spending and force it to review its foreclosure practices. Bank of America's board of directors opposes the resolutions. Service Employees International Union organizer Stephen Lerner told HuffPost that Bank of America has hired off-duty police to serve as security officers inside the meeting. Despite being off-duty and employed by a private company, Lerner said the officers will have the authority to arrest people inside the meeting.Outside the meeting, protesters promise a boisterous slate of events drawing attention to Bank of America's relationship with the federal government, the coal industry and its long record of foreclosure abuse. Occupy Atlanta's Tim Franzen said there are three marches planned, each with its own theme: the bank's environmental record, the housing crisis and corporate accountability issues. The marches will converge into one big protest Wednesday morning.Occupy Wall Street veteran Max Berger said he sees fighting Bank of America as a critical piece of the movement's goals. \"I think Bank of America is the most important thing that Occupy Wall Street has going on right now,\" he said. \"I look at Bank of America as the weak spot in the entire financial system. The campaign to break up Bank of America is like Luke blowing up the Death Star. It's the one thing that keeps the whole thing together. This is the opportunity to hold the people who destroyed the economy accountable for what they did.\"Berger is flying into Charlotte for the protest. Franzen said Occupy Atlanta is taking 20 or so of its members. Shapiro said Occupy Wall Street has rented a bus, which arrived in Charlotte Monday night. She has already met people from Olympia, Wash., and from Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and across North Carolina.Occupy activists won't just be meeting each other for direct-action trainings and marches.Tony Romano, the organizing director with Right to the City, a national alliance of community groups organizing around foreclosures, said his group is bringing roughly 175 residents who have been evicted by Bank of America, along with community members from Miami, Boston, New Orleans and Virginia. \"They are folks whose homes are being stolen by Bank of America, and their lives are being destroyed by Bank of America,\" Romano said.\"Some of our folks decided they wanted to influence Bank of America -- some have shares,\" Romano said. Some have asked to speak at the shareholders' meeting. \"Other folks will be protesting,\" he said, \"hitting Bank of America from every side.\"On Thursday, the group Right to the City is hosting a one-day \"Urban Congress\" for groups to share their home-defense tactics. More than 250 people will attend, Romano said.Bank of America emphasizes that it has performed 200,000 loan modifications under President Barack Obama's Home Affordable Modification Program, and has increased staffing to improve its outreach to borrowers. The bank was active in the subprime mortgage market during the housing bubble and purchased the nation's largest mortgage lender, Countrywide, in 2008. The bank has been plagued by widespread allegations of foreclosure fraud in the years since.Meanwhile, environmental groups will be decrying the bank's relationship with the coal industry.\"A human health crisis is exploding in Appalachia and Bank of America lights the fuse every day,\" said Coal River Mountain Watch president Bob Kincaid. \"This bank and its shareholders must confront the brutality of what they do.\"Kincaid noted that 3 million to 5 million pounds of explosives are detonated every day in Appalachia in mountaintop removal mining, stripping away rock and soil to expose mineable coal. Scientific research shows that runoff from those activities is poisoning citizens in surrounding areas, with increased birth defects, cancer rates that lead to 4,000 deaths a year in West Virginia, according to Kincaid.\"That's a newborn who never knows a clear breath, a 4-year-old who never gets to be a 5-year-old, a mother who never gets to be a grandmother,\" Kincaid told reporters Tuesday. \"That is what Bank of America finances when it finances the coal industry.\"Bank of America told HuffPost it recognizes the urgency to address climate change and energy challenges, but argued that the move to a low-carbon economy will take time and there are environmental impacts attributed to all sources of energy. Bank of America is the single largest financer of the coal industry in the U.S.Coal River Mountain Watch is one of several organizations that has been protesting Bank of America's policies at its shareholder meetings in recent years, with anti-foreclosure groups also taking prominence. But in the aftermath of Occupy Wall Street's efforts to popularize discontent with income inequality and corporate influence of American politics, this year's meeting will be a bigger gathering with broader themes.\"I think Occupy co-opted all of us,\" said Stephen Lerner, an organizer with the Service Employees International Union.The selection of Charlotte for September's DNC Convention is itself emblematic of the rift between the party's base and its more corporate-friendly leadership. Charlotte has long been nicknamed the \"Wall Street of the South\" because of Bank of America's headquarters and the heavy presence of Wells Fargo, which bought Charlotte-based Wachovia. Activists view the choice as an effort from the Democratic Party establishment to curry favor with the state's banking elite -- a constituency that played a significant role in the subprime lending explosion and subsequent economic catastrophe."}, {"title": "Coursera and edX: Game-Changers for Sustainable Business?", "text": "The first thing I thought when I heard about the launch of Coursera -- a tech startup partnership of big-name universities developed to provide scalable, web-based education solutions -- was that it could hold huge potential for furthering sustainable business thinking. A few days later, edX, a similarly-focused but nonprofit Harvard and MIT partnership, launched. No matter which platform you prefer, this trend in free online courses is an education game-changer with incredible potential to change business for the better. And not a moment too soon for sustainability.What would happen if more people, not just the usual (privileged) suspects, had access to the theory, concepts and best practices that could help them become the sustainability change agents or leaders in their respective workplaces? If the finest of sustainable business and corporate social responsibility-related courses were offered free through these new online ventures, students could more easily gain new tools and perspective, and begin to re-shape the way their employers deal with today's natural resource and social responsibility challenges.Even an introduction to systems thinking, environmental justice or corporate responsibility might lead mid-career students, for example, to positively disrupt their workplaces. Consider these fictional characters (and please excuse my lack of attempt at making up clever names!): After studying up on the operations implications of sustainability, Joe Smith, a manager at a Midwestern manufacturing company, sees new ways to decrease their use of electricity and recycle water. Susie Jones, a human resources manager within a southern school system, uses her new perspective to help teachers sustain interest and enthusiasm that, in turn, leads to their building better connections with the students in their classrooms. And, Pete Davis, a physician in an East Coast university health network incorporates his learned sustainability thinking into medication administration issues, helping him better assess whether the gases used for anesthesia could be cycled more efficiently. Now, just imagine how powerful the authentic student testimonials that result from Coursera or edX participation could be in comparison to these fictional tales!The question is: are sustainable thinking and decision-making courses yet on the radar of either of these two new platforms? The New York Times reports that Coursera's web portal currently focuses on delivering courses in the humanities, social sciences, physical sciences and engineering. Since they don't open their \"doors\" until Fall of 2012, edX has not yet listed any of their specific offerings. So, there are no sustainability-related courses on tap, for now.Yet the knowledge and curriculum for sustainable thinking in business lies ready and waiting. For example, one Coursera partner, the University of Michigan (full disclosure: I'm an alumnus) could draw immediately from its Erb Institute, which focuses on global sustainable enterprise. And edX partner Harvard University could also quickly share courses from its extension graduate program in sustainability and environmental management, among its many other resources.The platforms are there and the content exists, but are their downsides? Would these \"free and accessible\" options affect the need for or benefits of undertaking the existing full undergraduate or graduate sustainability degree programs that have already been established? No. Instead, with the help of Coursera and edX, many more students will now be able to take charge of integrating some sustainability theory and best practices into their own education and work -- whether their focus is accounting, marketing or industrial design. Fancy degree or no, sustainable business change agents welcome the mix of degrees and individual course self-training, because it all combines to mean more power for the cause.Portals like Coursera and edX are prepped to offer world-class courses that foster business minds to question, inspire, collaborate and lead sustainable change. With the business case for sustainability becoming more and more unavoidable, many a corporation should be lining up -- now -- to hire these minds. Let the game-change begin."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - May 8, 2012", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport.The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!.IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Billionaire codger cage match: T.

When they began to gain in popularity in the 1970s, there were FDA attempts to recall them. Recently, there's been a movement to ban them in Canada. In the States, there are occasional animal cruelty cases brought upon those who use them; in June, a woman in Mahopac, N.Y., was charged after it was found that her pitbull's shock collar had become permanently embedded in his neck.In 2010 they were outlawed in Wales. Last summer, the country prosecuted its first offender, fining him $3,000 for using one on his pet collie.Last year, Bryan Lynn of OutDoorLife.com'sGun Dog blog wrote a piece defending the use of shock collars on dogs. The post was a response to Gizmodo's relaying my shock at the news that the GPS maker Garmin was buying a top American shock collar manufacturer, in what seems to be an effort to beef up their own line of shock-collars. As an animal trainer, I'm dismayed that tons of dog owners and trainers continue to use these modern-day torture devices when there are so many other tools that are available to us.There are several kinds of shock collars. Some give a shock that is triggered by the vibration of the dog's throat. These are used to discourage barking. Others are part of an electric fence system; a few beeps warn the dog as it approaches the invisible fence, and then shocks him if he crosses the barrier. Then there are remote control operated shock collars. Most collars of this kind are used by \"gun\" dogs who accompany their owners on hunting expeditions.Shocking a dog while he is doing something he thinks is fun -- something they've been bred to do for thousands of years -- seems particularly cruel, since it can forever link that pleasurable thing with the fear of an occasional unexpected jolt. What's more, there is a degree of imprecision when training any animal, especially one that doesn't speak your language. You might be shocking for one thing (barking, say) but the jolt comes just as your dog steps on his dog bed. You might have just deterred him from going to his bed, but he thinks barking is safe. What if he barks just as the shock stops? For all you know, you've helped erroneously communicate that the bed is bad but that barking after stepping off the bed can make the pain go away. Barking is therefore good. Even I'm confused, and I'm a human.However, as Brian Lynn points out, I really don't know much about hunting and I've never received any kind of professional instruction on using electric collars. Also, as a non-vegetarian making a case for animal rights, I would go so far as to label myself a hypocrite. Here I am treating my little poodle mix like a baby doll while I pick at a plate of fried bacon.So, I'd like to abandon any kind of animal rights argument in favor of this one: Shock collars can be dangerous to people. A common retort that people often have to shock collars is: Would you treat your child that way? Yes, apparently some people would. YouTube hosts literally hundreds of people shocking themselves and their loved ones with electric collars made for dogs. Many of the victims are children.It makes me wonder about all the dark things people are doing with shock collars to each other in situations that aren't fit for YouTube primetime.(This post originally appeared on TheDogs)"}, {"title": "Marine Life Suffers Near BP's Deepwater Horizon Site", "text": "This article was published in The Louisiana Weekly in the May 7, 2012 edition.Dolphins are washing up dead while fish disappear as oil and dispersants from BP's 2010 spill lurk in Gulf waters and marshes. Last month, Riki Ott, marine toxicologist and former Alaska fisherwoman, said \"the Gulf looks a lot like Prince William Sound,\" the site of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. \"Our collapse came four years in. I don't like what I'm seeing with Gulf shrimp, crabs and dolphins.\" She spoke at an April 20, town hall meeting on the spill at First Unitarian Universalist Church in New Orleans.Captain Lori DeAngelis, owner of Dolphin Queen Cruises in Orange Beach, Ala., spoke too, and said \"the government's got hundreds of dead dolphins in freezers since the spill, and for every one collected another 50 to 250 died in the Gulf and weren't found.\" She gives wild dolphin tours. \"These marine mammals are similar to us in many ways,\" DeAngelis said. \"If humans lived in the water 24 hours a day, we'd be exposed to what's hurting the dolphins.\"Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a much larger-than-usual 614 cetaceans, or dolphins and whales, were found stranded and mostly dead along the Gulf Coast in the two years from April 30, 2010--ten days after the BP spill began--to April 29 of this year. They were mainly dolphins. But NOAA also noted that strandings--which are beached animals or those in need of medical attention while swimming--started to increase three months before the spill.Fionna Matheson, NOAA spokeswoman, said the current Unusual Mortality Event for dolphins began in Feb. 2010 and is part of NOAA's 30 years of monitoring strandings. A UME is a significant die-off of any, marine-mammal population. NOAA is investigating the BP spill as a factor in the current event but \"no definitive cause has yet been identified for the increase in stranding in the northern Gulf in 2010 and 2011,\" Matheson said last week. Eleven stranded Gulf dolphins have tested positive for brucella, a bacteria that causes the infectious disease brucellosis.In Louisiana,159 dolphins were found stranded dead and alive in 2011, versus 138 in Feb.-Dec. 2010 and an average 20 a year from 2002 to 2009. In the first four months of this year to April 22, 49 strandings were reported in Louisiana. NOAA says strandings probably represent only a fraction of those that died.In years prior to the spill, NOAA attributed UMEs among Gulf dolphins and whales to biotoxins, infectious diseases and unknown causes.Noise from seismic equipment used in oil-and-gas exploration has been bothering dolphins too. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management told Texas-based Global Geophysical Services Inc. not to conduct deep, seismic surveys in the Northern Gulf during this year's bottlenose-dolphin calving season from March 1 to April 30. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity want more restraints placed on seismic surveying so as not to disrupt the acoustic cues of dolphins.Meanwhile, NOAA has also documented hundreds of stranded dead sea turtles along the Gulf Coast since the BP spill. Four of the five species of Gulf sea turtles are endangered and one, the loggerhead, is threatened.What are fishermen seeing? Charter boat Captain Gregg Arnold, a twenty-year veteran of Gulf waters and owner of Fish In The Land Of Giants, said in New Orleans last week \"dolphins tend to stay behind my boat and I haven't noticed anything unusual about them recently. They're smart and know how to crowd fish into a corner.\" However, what he's observed among fish alarms him. In the water on the east side of Plaquemines and St. Bernard Parishes, Arnold estimated the trout population is down by as much as 98 percent since the spill while redfish numbers are off by 50 percent.\"We've seen redfish and trout with lesions since the spill, and we didn't see that before,\" Arnold said. \"We've noticed a decline in the amount of bait--pilchards, mullet, shrimp and crabs. And sharks are moving closer to shore, probably because they can't find food.\"Arnold said \"the oil and dispersants were bad, and I can't believe they're all gone. They may not be visible from a boat or by satellite but they're in the water column, and currents are pushing them this way and that. Bait fish are being murdered by the unseen.\"Fish numbers to the east of Plaquemines were waning before the spill but have been in rapid decline since, Arnold said. \"We've still got the best redfishing in the world but I'm worried this fall-off in numbers will continue. Herring still haven't come back in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill more than 20 years ago.\"Arnold and his clients, who come from across the country and other nations, release most of the fish they catch. \"The redfish you see in restaurants in New Orleans is mostly farm-raised in Texas,\" he said.At the April town hall meeting at First Unitarian, speakers discussed oil and dispersants. Riki Ott said that Corexit used in the Exxon Valdez spill affected wildlife and humans. \"The ones who worked with dispersants were the sickest,\" she said. According to the group Alaska Community Action on Toxics, Corexit used to disperse oil from the Exxon Valdez spill caused human respiratory, nervous system, kidney, liver and blood disorders. Those are the same symptoms suffered by many cleanup workers and some Gulf Coast residents since the BP spill. Corexit is made by Nalco in Naperville, Illinois.   At the April forum, Buras, La. resident Kindra Arnesen, who has young children with BP spill-related ailments, said \"we are constantly re-exposed to oil and dispersants where we live.\" And Dean Blanchard of Dean Blanchard Seafood, Inc. in Grand Isle, said nighttime spraying of Corexit has continued in his area since the spill.Last month, three U.S. West Coast nonprofits--Center for Biological Diversity, Surfrider Foundation and Pacific Environment--sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for authorizing the use of dispersants without ensuring that they wouldn't harm endangered species or their habitats. The EPA must approve the use of chemical dispersants in an oil spill. The Center for Biological Diversity said dispersed oil is toxic to all stages of fish life and dispersants are dangerous to human health. Dispersants used by BP--Corexit 9500 and 9527--have been banned in the United Kingdom, where BP is headquartered.Meanwhile, in Barataria Bay in Southeast Louisiana, BP is funding an assessment of the dolphin population as part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process since the spill. NOAA, the Louisiana Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries, other federal and state agencies and the Chicago Zoological Society are conducting that study. end"}, {"title": "Truth Takes a Back Seat in Lacey Act Hearing", "text": "Today, I had the opportunity to testify before the Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs on two bills that would repeal significant portions of the Lacey Act. The Lacey Act is common sense legislation that protects American workers and industries from illegally harvested or exported materials.I was severely disappointed, however, that one of the witnesses invited by the majority, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, chose to attack the Lacey Act using misleading statistics and half-truths if not all-out lies. At the center of Senator Paul's testimony was an oft-repeated, yet apocryphal, story about two American fishermen who were unjustly prosecuted under the Lacey Act for transporting their catch in cardboard containers instead of plastic. Senator Paul was outraged that these two fishermen would be subject to monetary penalty, and even jail time, because of this simple mistake.I would be outraged, too... if the story were even remotely true.The two fishermen were doing far more than carrying lobsters in the wrong containers -- they were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy, smuggling, and money laundering. Their convictions were upheld by a U.S. federal district court and also by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. This was a textbook case of criminals trying to circumvent the law for 400,000 pounds of lobster worth $4.6 million.Therefore it is especially offensive to see a U.S. Senator parroting this \"fisherman's tale\" -- who can ever believe those -- without even getting into the facts. Even worse, Senator Paul then used this doctored story for his personal political goal of gutting the protections that exist for the benefit of American jobs and the environment.Senator Paul's testimony was a perfect example of what's wrong with the political system today. He is more than willing to mislead and confuse public opinion to justify his world view. This is not something unique to Republicans, but happens whenever public figures put their own political goals ahead of the truth and the greater good. Instead of this constant game of spin and counter-spin where the facts take a back seat, we need to work together to find compromise solutions that deal with the underlying problems we face, whether those are jobs, civil liberties, national security, infrastructure investment, or protecting the environment.That's what I have been working on in regards to the Lacey Act. We have a broad coalition who supports American workers and strong environmental protections with groups such as the League of Conservation Voters, the Hardwood Federation, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Sierra Club, and the United Steelworkers. This varied group is able to work together on this issue because they are willing to put their short-term goals on the back burner and focus on long-term issues in a way that promotes justice, fairness, and an inclusive table with room for all, while dealing head-on with facts.That is the type of political coalition and system I am proud to be part of."}, {"title": "FlexEnergy: Making the Most of Methane", "text": "Methane can be produced in a variety of ways -- the biggest contributor, as well as the one that we're all familiar with, is from cows. In addition to cows, methane is emitted from human-influenced sources such as landfills, agricultural activities, coal mining, wastewater treatment, etc... the list goes on and on. FlexEnergy is focusing their business on the methane that is the primary constituent of natural gas. While using methane to make fuel is not new, the Flex Powerstation aims to produce electricity from low-grade sources, even as low as 5% methane.This change -- the ability to use low-density methane -- means it can be used in any application that produces methane such as older landfills, wastewater treatment plants, oil fields, coal mines and dairy digesters. Flex says the technology produces Near Zero Emissions, operates on gases down to 50 Btu/scf (1700 kJ/m3), and has an internal cogeneration system available while also maintaining a small footprint. Such a system, if it can operate as Flex says it can, would offer a number of operations that produce or use methane with a clean and efficient way to turn it into continuous energy.We at Planet Forward want to know what you have to say about turning methane into a valuable fuel.

The Plant is billed as a vertical farm that operates using a plethora of sustainable practices. Used grain from the building's microbrewery feeds its fish farm, whose waste in turn feeds its mushroom farm (and other plants), which in turn cleans the water so it can go back to the fish farm. Any waste not actively being used goes into an anaerobic digester, which creates methane for use in generating the building's heat, electricity and steam for brewing.But there's more. According to Dickson Despommier's \"The Vertical Farm\" site, anticipated population growth will require us to increase our farmland by 20 percent to keep pace. But this is problematic, since we're estimated to already be using 80 percent of land suitable for farming, and traditional land practices lay about 15 percent to waste. The math is not encouraging.Enter vertical farming. Despommier cites statistics projecting about 80 percent of Earth's population to be urbanites by mid-century. By using their multi-level structure to create multiple acres of farm land on the footprint of one, vertical farms essentially create farmland out of thin air, grow crops sustainably within the regions that need them most and do so year-round. There are claimed to be other benefits as well, such as the virtual elimination of weather-related crop failures, pesticides, agricultural runoff and more.While vertical farms are relatively new on the scene, urban farming started making noise in the 1990s and can be found in places ranging from New York City to Tokyo to Caracas, Venezuela.Read more about The Plant at Grist and Fast Company.

The official title of the newly created position? It\u2019s a big name for a big job: Deputy commissioner for recycling and sustainability.\"Ron\u2019s years of work in the recycling and sustainability field perfectly matches the needs that we have at the D.S.N.Y. so that we can meet the mayor\u2019s specific goals,\u201d said New York City sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, in a statement announcing the hire.Gonen, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and a founding partner of high-end sustainable jewelry company Lindhardt Design Studio, plans to zero in on two, not-too-surprising key areas when he starts the job later this month. The first is a biggie: \u201caggressively\u201d installing more public recycling receptacles alongside the 25,000 trash cans scattered throughout the city (currently there are only 1,000 public recycling bins on city streets and in parks). In Seattle, for example, there are 682 public trash cans on city streets and more than half of them are accompanied by recycling containers for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and paper. In New York, there are options for recycling Christmas trees and old textiles, but properly disposing of a can of ginger ale while visiting a public park or waiting for the train? Good luck.Secondly, Gonen plans to follow in the footsteps of West Coast recycling powerhouses like San Francisco, Seattle and Portland by launching a pilot program for curbside organic waste pickup. This is fabulous news for both the city\u2019s rat population and for residents sick and tired of hauling containers of decomposing food scraps to farmers markets each and every weekend. \u201cWe need to make it very convenient for people to recycle,\u201d Gonen told the New York Times Green Blog. Yes, yes you do.Best of luck to Gonen as he starts in with new position.

The inch-long seahorse -- the smallest in the U.S. -- is no mythical creature but is exceedingly rare. In recent years, they've been driven to the brink of extinction by pollution, collection and, most recently, the BP oil spill.In response to these threats, the National Marine Fisheries Service just announced that the dwarf seahorses may warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act. The agency will spend the next year determining whether the seahorses, which live in the Gulf and the Caribbean, will get protection. In the meantime, there are five important lessons to be learned from the plight of these strange and endearing creatures.1. Offshore drilling is still dangerous. Yep, even though oil companies have assured us for years that it's safe, offshore drilling can go disastrously wrong. BP's busted Macondo well spewed uncontrolled for months in the spring and summer of 2010, dumping more than 200 million gallons of toxic oil in to the Gulf of Mexico. Two years later, some minor changes have been made in how drilling is regulated, but many of the fundamental dangers of offshore drilling remain unaddressed. And now drillers have set their sights on the Arctic, where cleanup of an oil spill would be nearly impossible. We saw what happened to birds and turtles in the Gulf of Mexico; think what would happen to the polar bears and walruses of the Great White North.2. Spills kill more than you think. Some of the most disturbing photos in the aftermath of the oil spill were of dead pelicans, dolphins and sea turtles. As troubling as those are, the spill had profound -- if more difficult to see -- impacts on smaller animals in the Gulf, many of which are building blocks of their natural ecosystems. The plankton, plants and small fish were among the hardest hit and their harm will reverberate up the food chain. The dwarf seahorse was severely impacted. Both the oil and the chemical dispersants used in the aftermath are toxic to seahorses and their seagrass habitat -- and it may be years before we fully understand the damage.3. Places Matter. Protecting rare and disappearing species means protecting the wild places where they live. In the case of the slow-swimming dwarf seahorse, the vast mats of seagrass are a perpetual home. It's where they live, feed and breed. No seagrass, no dwarf seahorses. In fact, one acre of seagrass can support tens of thousands of fish and millions of tiny invertebrates. For that reason, seagrasses have long been considered a significant \"indicator\" species that reflects the broader health of coastal areas. By protecting the dwarf seahorse, we'll also be protecting the homes for scores of other creatures they share the seagrass with.4. Be nimble, take swift action when necessary. Although seahorses were already struggling before the BP disaster in April 2010, the oil spill accelerated their path toward extinction. That's why it's important that the National Marine Fisheries Service moves quickly to protect them. We can't be complacent in the face of new facts. And, in the case of species already on the brink of extinction, it's incumbent upon those with the power to protect them before their decline becomes irreversible. When Congress wrote the Endangered Species Act, it wisely included provisions allowing the government to take swift action when needed. Think of the Act as the emergency room for wildlife in trouble -- and the struggling dwarf seahorse certainly fits the bill.5. Embrace nature's weirdness. Seriously. Some may ask why save this tiny seahorse at all? We don't eat it, it's not worth much money, so what's the point? If we let the dwarf seahorse slip away, we'd lose yet another of nature's fascinating citizens. The males are the ones who get pregnant, and couples, once formed, are completely monogamous and known for their peculiar greeting ritual conducted each morning. But beyond just being interesting, the dwarf seahorse is part of a suite of life that nourishes biodiversity, where each piece is part of a larger, more complex whole that ultimately enables life on Earth. Giving up on species like the dwarf seahorse -- with all its glorious weirdness -- wouldn't bode well on the future we're building for ourselves."}, {"title": "Makeshift Russian Cat-Lift Is Eco-Friendly, Made From Repurposed Materials (VIDEO)", "text": "In eco-friendly Russia, cat-lift lifts you!

A project of 350.org, led by climate activist Bill McKibben, the May 5 Day of Action will be happening mere weeks before the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, also known as Rio+20 -- where global leaders will meet to make commitments towards carbon reductions 20 years after the UN's first Conference on Sustainable Development. They will also use the opportunity of the multilateral forum to map out the so-called \"green economy\".That's where 6/5/12 comes in.There is an urgent need for communities around the world to send a message to their elected officials participating in Rio+20: We want a truly green economy, not a greenwashed economy. We want an economy that supports communities, not multinational corporations. And we want an economy that upholds our common resources like water as a public trust, not a commodity, and recognizes the human right to water.That's why June 5 is another day of action here in the U.S.: a day to tell our government to get Wall Street out of Rio. The Rio+20 \"green economy\" agenda is being driven by interests that seek to privatize nature by further deregulating industry and handing our common resources over to companies for profit. It is part of a push to give each aspect of nature a monetary value, thus locking natural resources management into the vagaries of the market for generations to come.How do we know this is the plan for our essential resources? The United Nations Environment Program's Green Economy report, a seminal tool in advancing sustainable development, was authored by a career banker from Deutsche Bank. UNEP states in its Ecosystem Management report that \"UNEP collaborates with international financial institutions to develop methods of integrating ecosystem services into their global and national strategies and operations.\"Here's what the Chief Economist at Citigroup, Willem Buiter, envisions for water:I expect to see a globally integrated market for fresh water within 25 to 30 years. Once the spot markets for water are integrated, futures markets and other derivative water-based financial instruments -- puts, calls, swaps -- both exchange-traded and OTC will follow. There will be different grades and types of fresh water, just the way we have light sweet and heavy sour crude oil today. Water as an asset class will, in my view, become eventually the single most important physical-commodity based asset class, dwarfing oil, copper, agricultural commodities and precious metals.Many economists and market-oriented environmentalists have bought into the notion that we should let the market decide when it comes to pricing water and putting a price on pollution, noting that the higher the cost, the more wisely people will use water and the less likely corporations will be to pollute. But pricing water higher for a public resource that has no substitution and that is essential for human life will only price out the poorest. Likewise, pollution trading is, simply, paying for the right to pollute. It does nothing to stop pollution like good old-fashioned regulation. It's a way to let corporations continue to use and abuse our essential resources, business as usual.Privatization and market-based mechanisms like water markets and pollution trading are not a part of a truly green economy. It is the financialization of nature. And if Citibank's vision for water comes to fruition, water will be traded in the same fashion as bad mortgages. But we can't afford a mortgage crisis for water.Sign up to learn more about our June 5 day of action to tell the U.S. not to sell out nature to Wall Street at Rio+20.This post originally appeared on Food & Water Watch's blog."}, {"title": "Photos That Put a Human Face on the Climate Crisis", "text": "Can a single photograph change the world? Can a thousand pictures inspire a global movement?On Christmas Eve, 1968, Bill Anders, an astronaut on the Apollo 8 mission, snapped what would become one of the most iconic photographs of all time, an image of planet Earth rising in the darkness above a barren and lifeless moon.At the time, millions of Americans were beginning to connect the dots between the pollution in their backyards -- the burning Cuyahoga River, the oil off the coast of Santa Barbara, the smog-filled streets of New York -- and the need for new environmental laws that could combat pollution at the national level. For many, \"Earthrise,\" as the photograph came to be known, encapsulated in a single image this new understanding that our planet wasn't a limitless, indestructible resource, but a fragile and unique home that needed our protection.Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThis new ecological consciousness helped give birth to the modern-day environmental movement. Less than two years after the photograph was taken, 20 million people marched in the streets for the first Earth Day, helping catalyze what would become the most productive era of new environmental legislation in American history.As our generation struggles to deal with the challenge of climate change, we need another Earthrise moment. A revelation that the individual changes we're witnessing in our environment -- a warmer summer here, another 100-year flood there -- aren't just isolated incidents, but part of larger crisis, the first hemorrhages of a system-wide failure.In 1968, an era still dominated by a few major broadcasting networks and newspapers of note, this revelation could come in the form a single photograph. In 2012, with our limited attention spans chasing after the latest tweet or Facebook post, perhaps our moment of insight will take a different form.This weekend, 350.org, an international climate campaign I co-founded in 2008 with a group of college friends and writer and environmentalist Bill McKibben, hosted Climate Impacts Day, a global effort to connect the dots between local climate impacts -- like the extreme weather events millions of people across the planet have experienced in the last couple of years -- and the broader climate crisis.For the last 48 hours, I've been clicking through the thousands of photographs that flooded into our Flickr page from Climate Impacts Day events taking place in more than 100 countries around the world.Many of the pictures are uplifting, like this shot of a group of students in Johannesburg, South Africa, forming a dot in their community garden to show that their working hard to care for the seeds of a more sustainable future:Others are funny, like this picture of a giant 80-foot banner that says \"I'm Melting\" laid out on the Dana Glacier in the Sierras:There are photos of activists connecting the dots to the roots of our current crisis, like this group from Occupy London who held a giant game of climate \"Twister\" to show how the 1 percent profits from climate destruction:And images that demonstrate incredible creativity, like this photograph from Orissa, India of a sand-sculpture connecting the extreme heat the region is experiencing to global warming:But a great deal of the images are incredibly sad. These women in Pakistan are standing outside the \"temporary\" shelter that has been their home since record flooding in 2010 displaced them and 20 million others:Halfway around the world in Vermont, another woman stands in the remains of her cafe that was wrecked by flooding after Hurricane Irene battered the state last August:Even some of the more whimsical photos are poignant. Like this group of young people in the Maldives who found a creative way to show what sea level rise will mean for their islands. My first thought was, what a cool way to visualize a climate impact. My second was, these kids could be refugees in the next couple decades:Or this picture of a young girl in Brazil, posing in an entire living room recreated in the waves. She's probably having a great time, but the picture is a good reminder that more than 634 million people around the world live within 30 feet of sea level:As I looked through face after face of people already bearing the impacts of the climate crisis, it began to dawn on me that maybe we've been looking for our Earthrise photo in all the wrong places. Seeing a picture of the Earth from space allowed a previous generation to re-imagine their connection with the planet. Perhaps a new set of pictures can help us re-imagine our connection with each other. Maybe putting a human face on climate change, switching out some of the polar bears for people, can help us understand more deeply that global warming isn't some environmental challenge for the future but a human rights crisis in the here and now.After all, the Civil Rights movement in this country didn't turn to graphs of socioeconomic inequality to convey the fundamental injustices of segregation. They looked to photographs of everyday people: Rosa Parks sitting on that bus, young girls being attacked by Bull Connor's dogs.According to Julian Cox, who curated a show of civil rights photography at the High Museum in New York City, movement leaders saw photography as a crucial tool for raising public awareness and mobilizing their base. \"That was definitely understood by the leaders,\" Cox told the New York Times. \"I cannot emphasize enough how well prepared they were, how they understood almost immediately how they could use the medium to advance their cause.\"I doubt that any one photograph from this weekend will have the transformative effect of Earthrise or that Rosa Parks picture, but as Facebook feeds around the world fill up with these pictures -- the women in Pakistan, the child in Brazil -- perhaps a few people will be struck with that moment of insight or a few more will begin to see that human dimension of the climate crisis.It's a small step forward in putting a human face on one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced."}, {"title": "The Heartland Billboard Embarrassment and the Dangers of Ideological Ignorance", "text": "The Heartland Institute, a fiercely conservative/libertarian think tank that champions denial of climate change, briefly ran a billboard in Chicago last week featuring a photo of notorious criminal Ted Kaczynski (aka the Unabomber) next to the message \"I still believe in global warming. Do you?\" Heartland allegedly promised future ads featuring Charles Manson and Osama bin Laden, but pulled the billboard (it was electronic) after it was universally derided, even by those who deny climate change, some of whom said they will no longer participate in Heartland's annual climate denial conference. Heartland's decision to quickly pull the ad may also have been influenced by a flood of negative feedback from their funders. The Diageo Beverage Company and State Farm Insurance say they will no longer support the group, as did General Motors recently, because of it's extremism and climate denial.Heartland explained their effort as \"an experiment\" necessary to raise the issue. That's 'cover our ass' hogwash. Anthony Watts, a leader of the climate denial cause, apologized that Heartland was just experiencing \"battle fatigue.\" Watts was closer to the truth than he probably realized. This billboard, and the accompanying explanation on Heartland's website, are in fact a clarion demonstration of how climate change is not a battle about facts and evidence as much as it is an ideological fight over whose tribe will win, and how the more one side feels it's losing ground, the more passionate/louder/uglier/dumber they get.Any fair-minded reader of Heartland's online justification for this campaign can easily see that it veers far from the facts about climate change, and falls deeply into chasm of closed-minded passionate ideology. Consider these statements: Heartland suggests that associating Kaczynski and Manson with climate change undercuts the whole case for global warming because \"... what these murderers and madmen have said differs very little from what spokespersons for the United Nations, journalists for the \"mainstream\" media, and liberal politicians say about global warming.\" If that tortured argument doesn't stun any reasonable thinker -- even climate change doubters who still have a bit of self-respect for their own intelligence -- try this one. Heartland goes on to charge that \"The most prominent advocates of global warming aren't scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen.\" Some arguably more prominent advocates of global warming than Kaczynski and Manson include such 'murders, tyrants, and madmen' as the Pope, the Dalai Lama, most Nobel Prize winners, the heads of pretty much every university on the planet, etc.The designers of the campaign might not have even realized it themselves, but their effort to raise the volume with this embarrassing billboard isn't designed to persuade others about climate change as much as it is to reinforce the existing beliefs of the already-established true believers. It is far less an appeal to reason, and far more a campaign to preach to the choir, to circle the ideological wagons of the members of the tribe, and rally the troops around Heartland's deeply conservative and libertarian ideals.There is nothing inherently wrong with that, and of course, every tribe does it. Such passionate closed-minded denial of the evidence is certainly true of the extreme and apocalyptic claims about nuclear power or genetically modified food from some who call themselves environmentalists. But this campaign goes further, because the ideological passion here is so virulent that it has left credibility in the dust and ultimately makes Heartland, and the tribe it represents, seem more ignorant in their visceral passion than thoughtful, credible, or persuasive about the views they'd like others to adopt.There is a message here for all of us, and it goes far beyond the issue of climate change. To some degree, we all behave this way. We argue our beliefs based on the facts, but in fact we subconsciously shape our beliefs so they agree with the group, the tribe, with which we most strongly identify. This strengthens our tribe's acceptance of us as a member in good standing, and produces social cohesion that strengthens our tribe's dominance in overall society. This is a powerful subconscious imperative because acceptance by our tribe and our tribe's overall dominance are both important for the safety and survival of social animals like us. (This phenomenon has been called Cultural Cognition.)  This Heartland campaign isn't just battle fatigue. It's what true believers do when they are challenged and feel like they may be losing the argument, which feels threatening in a very deep way. It should make dramatically clear to all of us, on any side of any issue, how counterproductively far beyond reason this tendency can take us. The more driven we are to circle the wagons in pursuit of the safety of social cohesion, the more we abandon intellect and careful critical thinking, and the dumber we get, and the more closed our minds become... and the less influential we look and sound to others. The utter abandonment of reason demonstrated in this Heartland billboard campaign is just one example of a lot of the fiercely polarized, virulently closed-minded no-room-for-compromise, no-hope-for-progress combat that passes for 'debate' in American society these days. What a much MUCH more dangerous world that makes it, for all of us."}, {"title": "Bumpy Ride to Electric Vehicle Ownership", "text": "It's not always easy being green.A couple of weekends ago, my husband and I test drove a Chevrolet Volt. We liked the \"concept car\" look of the Volt and, as (green) tech geeks, we were particularly captivated by the revolutionary engine design. As MotorTrend wrote, the Volt has \"the single most sophisticated powertrain on the planet.\"Now that's exciting. We decided to buy one.When we got home that evening, my husband -- the practical one in our relationship -- observed, \"You know, we really should figure out where we're going to plug this thing in.\" Of course: plugging it in, that's the whole point.Somehow this detail had escaped me. I can quickly rattle of statistics about the benefits of electric vehicles: zero tailpipe emissions when running all-electric, overall air pollution reduction up to 80%, 13 cents to drive 1 mile on gas and 2 cents on electricity, and, for the volt, an estimate miles per gallon (MPGe) of 94. But I hadn't focused on the infrastructure challenge and neither, seemingly, had anyone else. The car reviews we read went to great length to detail the different flavors of electric vehicles but they glossed over any discussion of how to charge your vehicle - what's required and what it would cost. The car dealer also glossed over those details or, more precisely, never mentioned them.It's true that in theory \"plugging in\" is easy. Electric vehicles can be plugged into any normal plug (110V-120V), just like any appliance, but if you don't have access to an outdoor outlet near where you park, that's a problem. The Home Owners Association (HOA) in our condo building told us that the building is considering infrastructure for electric vehicles but has not finalized any plans. It was many months away in the best case. We'd have to put in our own charging station.Undeterred, I called an electrician. He told me it would require a dedicated circuit that, in turn, would require running conduit several hundred feet in the parking garage. All possible for an estimated $6-$8K. Wow. That on top of the sticker price of the car. Well, we reasoned, maybe we can plug it in at work. Again, not easy. At work there was no outdoor outlet, requiring us to cut into an exterior wall and install an outdoor outlet.This made me reflect on the broader theme: there are great ideas and great technology out there to help us go green, but if it's this hard to adopt, then who will really be willing to make the effort?In truth, there are a few relatively easy things we can do right now to make the transition to electric vehicles a lot smoother.First, we need to place more responsibility on our building owners and our cities. Yes, it requires a little effort to install an electric vehicle charging station, but once you've installed it you can easily recoup the costs by charging the EV owners. The difference between the cost of electricity and the cost of gas is approximately 75 cents a gallon versus $4.10, so even with a premium included to repay the infrastructure cost, that's a bargain.The California Energy Commission (CEC) is making it easier for building owners to go electric by offering subsidies for electric vehicle charging stations as part of ChargeAmerica. This is a great program, although it's not big enough. Approximately $3.4 million will be spent helping to install 1600 chargers in California. The CEC should expand this important program, with the support of citizens that recognize the potential for electric vehicles to simultaneously address the air quality issues in our cities and the energy dependence issues in our country. City mayors and state senators also need to hear that there is widespread support for electric vehicles - and the infrastructure that enables them.Also, I have a message for Chevrolet: you have a big role to play here. You've built a great car. Now you need to educate the public, starting with your dealers. I was shocked that our car dealer wasn't more helpful in this process. Our internet research was more useful than anything he told us. Chevy, you need to geekify your salesforce.After some deliberation, we ended up buying the Volt. We figured out a relatively low-cost solution to plug-in at work, and our car dealer, feeling either sympathetic or guilty, chipped in some cash to help with our infrastructure problems.I'm still working on our HOA."}, {"title": "Pete Stark, Other Candidates Confuse Solyndra With Country, Car Manufacturer, Keystone XL Pipeline", "text": "Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), the 20-term incumbent facing a surprisingly competitive race in California's 15th congressional district, drew headlines recently when he confused failed solar energy company Solyndra with the electric car company known as Tesla.Upon being asked about the California-based solar firm in a recent interview with The San Francisco Chronicle Stark replied, \"I wish I had enough expense allowance to get one of those new S's that Solyndra's going to make down there -- the electric car. They run $60,000 to $90,000.\"He's not the only prominent candidate for office to make such a mistake.Back in February, GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney confused the defunct solar energy company with the Keystone XL oil pipeline, telling supporters in Atlanta, \u201cMy course for America is to become energy secure and to open up that Solyndra \u2013- that, that pipeline, excuse me, the Keystone pipeline,\u201d The Washington Post reported at the time.Romney then went on to criticize the Obama administration's \"crony capitalism,\" though months of investigations into Solyndra and other Department of Energy loans have failed to produce a smoking gun.In December, hours after a GOP presidential debate in Des Moines, Rick Perry mistook the now-bankrupt solar panel maker for a small country, as he sought to tar the Obama administration's handling of government spending. \"No greater example of it than this administration sending millions of dollars into the solar industry, and we lost that money,\" Perry said at the time. \"I want to say it was over $500 million that went to the country Solynda.\"For Perry, the Solyndra-as-country comment was just one in a string of highly memorable campaign gaffes that helped put a lid on his ambitions for the presidency. Now some are worried that Stark, the 80-year-old irascible liberal who's served four decades in Congress, may suffer a similar fate in his quest to keep his seat.The comment marks the latest development in a series of confounding assertions and unsubstantiated charges he has made in recent weeks.Watch the video of Stark's Solyndra slip-up above."}, {"title": "Alec Baldwin, Environmental Activist And Actor, To Host Anti-Fracking Event", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Michael d'Estries:Alec Baldwin has long been critical of America's dependence on fossil fuels, most recently publicly slamming Sen.

Has America come to that?When the biggest film of the year is about teenagers killing each other for the enjoyment of the masses, and when kids around the world massacre each other daily online in video games such as Warcraft, perhaps it is time for the world's most idealistic and moral movement, the environmental movement, to give in. Meet Pete Bethune and his \"holy warriors.\"Backed by a slick media presentation, Pete Bethune and his heavily armed mercenaries seem intent on changing the face of a historically peaceful movement. This \"eco-hero,\" who first lost his ship on TV, then became a media darling when his foolishness won him time in a Japanese prison is now packing heat. Is this our next gun-toting hero?Have we finally gone mad as a society? Just because the man looks good in a wetsuit, has tattoos, and a high \"TV-Q\" doesn't mean it's okay.I have been in the eco-business for more than 30 years, and have been on the front lines with activists from around the world, as evident in my latest film, Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist. Violence against humans is and was never condoned. Anyone who has been with the movement knows the responsibility to always keep the moral high ground. Difficult as it might be, those of us involved want to win the war, and the only way to do that is to not become \"them\" in the game of us and them. \"Them\" kills, whales, dolphins, and humans, whether directly or indirectly. From what I see, Pete Bethune is becoming \"them.\"I have no real opinion of Captain Pete Bethune other than what is evident in his own press. I have never served with him, and I wasn't involved in the Ady Gil controversy. I have been to Antarctica as a Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) officer, but I was not there when Pete lost his ship.I only know the facts: Pete's ship was rammed by a Japanese whaler, and suffered enough damage that it was lost. No one was injured as the captain and crew were on deck waving and taunting the approaching whaler. Why a ship that went 40+ knots was sitting dead in the water during a confrontation initiated by Captain Bethune is a question to be argued, and I don't really care what the excuses may be.What I care about is how Bethune's \"glorious record\" allows this man to speak for the environmental movement and deems him an expert in the field. How is he morally allowed to pose for photo ops and threaten \"bad guys\" with automatic weapons on behalf of individuals like me? The reason is, because the media loves him. He'll make great TV!What this is saying to the world is: To hell with the environment. TV means dollars so get out the way.People love to view train wrecks, and Pete Bethune and his buddies are a giant engine heading downhill. You can bet the same folks that bring you shows glorifying the killing of near extinct species and other \"dangerous catch-type\" shows, are the ones Pete is pitching.I understand that if it \"bleeds it leads\" in the news, and I know people watch me on Whale Wars hoping to see me get whacked, but let's remember: REALITY TELEVISION is two words and half is true. It's definitely television. On the other hand, Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist is the real deal and explains the media's positive involvement in the eco-business from the start, and how we got the cause on the map. But, we are now going too far, as humans tend to do.Pete and his buddies should leave the weapons to the authorities with the training and responsibility to use them. If they still insist on playing navy seals then they should do TV... fictional TV, you know, the James Bond type. Let's leave the eco business to those with the passion and courage of their convictions, those who are smart enough to realize that it is the ECO-business, not the EGO-business.For those catching Animal Planet's Whale Wars: Viking Shores, imagine who would be more successful: Pete Bethune and his warriors blasting ashore in his war canoe killing whalers in his path, or Sea Shepherd's Deborah Bassett with her logic, persistence and charm?I'm sure TV would go with Pete, but I hope we as humans are better than that.I can't help but quote Pogo when I say, \"I am afraid we have met the enemy and he (the enemy) is us.\""}, {"title": "7 Heroic Pets Who Saved Lives", "text": "Studies show that owning a cat, dog or other pet has a multitude of health benefits.

It Depends...", "text": "Along the coast where I live, at almost any time of year I love to experience the energies of various migrations of birds and of fish and whales. I think of it as the real world, as natural.But can we distinguish real from artificial when the world has become so human-dominated that some geologists have suggested naming our time the Anthropocene, the time of people? The migrations, the weather -- when we look closely, all bear our thumbprint.In my idealistic youth I was sometimes told to \"pay attention to the real world.\" But there I saw a place of tedium tallied in digits and zeros, where strings of zeroes are pursued and prized. The mass delusion of business's \"real world\" is the faith that the ledger books capture the value and the consequences of our transactions. They don't. Yet that collective delusion is real enough to mask some very concrete things.If people are using the world's forests, fishes, soils, freshwater and other resources something like 25 percent faster than the world can replace them, it means, basically, that the world would already be broke if we weren't taking so heavily from the future. People call it \"leveraging,\" but a new word for delusion doesn't cure the illness.In his prescient 1848 essay \"The Art of Living,\" John Stuart Mill foreshadowed much of what we'll be talking about regarding what counts as progress -- and what really is progress:There is room in the world, no doubt... for a great increase in population... I confess I see very little reason for desiring it.If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which... the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or happier population, I sincerely hope... they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compels them to it.A stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving \"The Art of Living,\" and much more likelihood of its being improved...All the mechanical inventions yet made have... enabled a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and imprisonment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others to make fortunes.By around 1800, when the world had about one billion people, The Reverend Thomas Malthus had become alarmed at the implications of population growth. Though water remained plentiful, vast tropical and temperate forests still stood as strangers to the saw, and the oceans shimmered with fishes that had never met a strand of twine, Malthus divined trouble brewing.Growing at just one percent annually, a population doubles in just 70 years. The U.S. already has twice as many people as when I was born; Tokyo's greater metropolitan area -- 35 million -- now has more people than all of Canada. During the 20th century, world population quadrupled; it's now approaching 7 billion. By 2050, we'll add to that more than the total human population of 1950.  How many people can this world support? It depends how they live. If everyone gets 800 kilograms of grains annually, like Americans, then the world can carry 2.5 billion people. Problem: we passed that in 1950. The world could support 10 billion people living like Indians. Problem: most Indians want to live more like Americans. (It would be interesting to see a 70-year-old American standing next to all the food -- and everything else -- that person had consumed in their lifetime.)Of course, before we eat our dinner, we need a refrigerator to store food. In 1980, China produced 50 thousand refrigerators; in 2004 it manufactured 30 million. We need to put the refrigerator in a house, and houses use wood. The forests of Indonesia, Burma, the Russian far-east, and Papua New Guinea will be largely gone by around 2025, and with them their birds, bugs, and Orangutans.To buy the food, we drive to the store. The Chinese would also like to drive to the store. To have as many cars per person as the U.S., China will need 30 percent more cars than exist worldwide today. Driving them would burn 98 million barrels of oil a day (the world now produces 85 million barrels). If this can't work for China, it can't work for India -- it can't work.We need a new, non-burning energy economy, a way of reducing population, and a way of replacing the delusion of infinite growth. That's what we need.Dividers: Four billion people live on less than $2 per day. Nearly a billion people get less than 80 percent of the UN-recommended caloric intake; they are, technically, starving. Undernourished women annually bear 20 million underweight infants, and more than half of Indian newborns would be in intensive care if born in California. A billion and a half people are overweight.  So there are two kinds of people in the world: those who want more, and those who need more. And those who need more, want more. One-quarter of the world's people consume more than three-quarters of the world's goods. That's not fair. But as I mentioned, to give everyone an American level of material living, we'd need two and a half Earths. That's not possible.Because forests, oceans, croplands, and water supplies are all being depleted by the number of people we have now, a grim logic appears irrefutable: As we add people, either everyone will get poorer on average, or the poor will get much poorer. Or the population will be adjusted in the usual way: with shortages, bullets, and bombs.Adapted from: The View From Lazy Point (Henry Holt Co., New York), winner of the 2012 Orion Book Award."}, {"title": "Chemical Agriculture's Dirty Fight", "text": "by guest blogger Alex Formuzis, of the Environmental Working GroupThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began testing fruits and vegetables for pesticide residues in 1991 after the public became concerned about their potential risks to children. Remember Alar? In 1993, at the request of Congress, several top public health experts released a seminal report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children. Three years later, Congress responded by passing unanimously the federal Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), which required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement health-based standards for all pesticides used in food, with special safeguards for infants and babies.This flurry of activity grew out of one overarching conclusion embraced by scientists, physicians, policy makers, parents, and the public interest community: Pesticides used in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables can cause serious and lasting harm to young children.That didn't stop conventional agribusiness interests from trying hard to water down or remove provisions of the proposed law designed to protect infants and children. The industry argued that it would cut into its profits if it had to take children's health into consideration.It lost that fight, but in the years that followed, chemical agriculture has repeatedly gone to the mattresses, enlisting its allies in Congress to try to dismantle the food safety law. And agribusiness is still trying.In 1999, former Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) introduced legislation that would have amended FQPA and effectively kept the EPA from protecting children from harmful levels of toxic pesticides. It turned out that Pombo's bill was a word-for-word copy of a proposal written by the \"Implementation Working Group\" (IWG), a front group formed by pesticide manufacturers and agricultural trade organizations. Following a meeting with California produce growers, Pombo offered the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999.Fortunately, the defenders of the FQPA rallied to its defense. \"The Pombo bill would be a major step backward,\" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.). \"It would guarantee that the law we passed would never be implemented.\"Conventional agriculture's campaign pulled out all the stops to try to weaken or repeal the new pesticide law, marshaling the industry's publications to disparage both the FQPA and the EPA.As a Washington Post story by George Lardner Jr. and Joby Warrick noted in May 2000:Articles and editorials in the farming trade press predicted that continuing with the current law would produce economic disaster for growers and mean less fresh fruit and vegetables for children, who would suffer more illnesses and deaths as a result. One November (1999) article in the magazine The Packer even likened EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner to infamous mass murderer John Wayne Gacy.Chemical agribusiness' spokesmen predicted that the safety standards implemented under FQPA would destroy American agriculture. The trade publication InsideEPA (subscription required) reported in May 1999 that:If the conservative default assumptions allowed under current law (FQPA) are used, some of the pesticides farmers now rely on will likely be pulled from the market, one industry source says. American farmers would be less competitive in the international market and could potentially be driven out of business, this source adds.In the end, however, the Pombo bill failed, and more than a decade later, there is U.S.-grown food in abundance in every supermarket in the country.In the years that followed, a number of pesticides that had been considered safe by conventional agriculture were found to be anything but, and EPA banned or restricted their use. And in virtually every instance when a pesticide came under the microscope of public health officials, chemical agribusiness fought to try to block any action by EPA.In 2006, for instance, EPA completed its FQPA-mandated review of the pesticide carbofuran, concluding that it harmed the nervous and reproductive systems and was too risky for consumers and workers:All products containing carbofuran generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment and do not meet safety standards, and therefore are ineligible for reregistration.In December 2009, the agency officially revoked its earlier approval of carbofuran for use on U.S. food crops.Chemical agriculture fought that decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where, five years later, the Roberts court refused to hear the case (National Corn Growers Association et al v. EPA).There are plenty of other examples of the industry's deny-and-delay tactics.In 2010, when environmental and community groups pressed EPA to restrict chlorpyrifos (aka Lorsban or Dursban), one of Dow AgroSciences' popular products, industry ran a scare-tactic ad to try to persuade consumers that fresh produce would disappear if that chemical were no longer in produce growers' toolbox.The battle goes on. Also in 2010, another agribusiness front group calling itself Alliance for Food and Farming (AFF), which represents many of the same interests that fought the 1996 pesticide law, enlisted the unwitting assistance of American taxpayers when it secured a USDA grant to attack the Environmental Working Group's Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce. Members of The Alliance also lobbied the Obama administration to change how USDA releases the annual pesticide residue tests that EWG uses to produce the Shopper's Guide.When the AFF or any representative of chemical agriculture tells consumers pesticides in food are perfectly safe and there is nothing to worry about, remember this history of what its representatives have done, or not done, where public health is concerned.USDA should be releasing its latest round of pesticide residue tests soon. When it does, EWG will do what we always do: give eaters the best available list of fruits and veggies that carry the highest and lowest levels of pesticides--even if the AFF wishes we wouldn't.Alex Formuzis is vice president for media relations at Environmental Working Group.

It was all about fracking. The petro tycoons first orchestrated the forced resignation of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) top frack patch enforcer, then adeptly forced the same cowed agency to stall its release of a damaging scientific study on fracking and finally strong armed the Interior Department to open America's public lands to gas companies without prior disclosure of their frack chemicals.On Monday, the oil industry showcased its political muscle by forcing the resignation of EPA's popular environmental enforcement chief for the Gulf region, Dr. Al Armendariz. Dr. Al was beloved by environmentalists, civic leaders, and poor and minority communities across five states for his willingness to strictly enforce environmental rules regardless of the lawbreakers' political clout. But Armendariz's courage won him powerful enemies as well. He was steadfastly undeterred by relentless pressure from polluters and their allies including political intrigue, hamstringing budget cuts, and even death threats directed at him and his family. But this week, the world's most powerful cartel -- an international syndicate feared even by the Obama Administration -- finally brought Dr. Armendariz down. Armendariz's mistake was promising to enforce the law against Big Oil in the shale gas fields.Several weeks ago, a two-year old-videotape surfaced showing Dr. Armendariz addressing a group of frightened and skeptical businessmen, civil leaders and property owners in Dish, Texas, a gas patch town familiar with government's anemic enforcement record against the oil barons. Dish's citizenry were terrified that reckless, dangerous and illegal practices by shale-gas fracking companies might jeopardize their community's property values, water supplies, jobs, local businesses and human health. Dish's Mayor, Calvin Tillman, who attended the meeting, had already moved his home away from the frack fields due to the daily nosebleeds afflicting his children ever since fracking operations commenced. Armenderiz assured Dish's shaken citizens that the EPA would enforce the law strictly in order to quickly bring industry outlaws into line.This was too much for Congress' \"law and order\" Republicans who apparently believe that oil companies, and shale fracking in particular, should be above the law. Lead by U.S. Senator, James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Big Petroleum's sock-puppet-in-chief, Congressional Republicans forced Armenderiz's dismissal. (As a private citizen, Dr. Al is no longer entitled to FBI protection and has had to appeal to the Dallas police for protection against continuing assassination threats.) Instead of the deterrence, for which Dr. Al had hoped, the episode sent an altogether different public message; government enforcers can lose their jobs by suggesting that the oil companies ought to obey America's laws.The Republicans complained that Armenderiz, by way of reassuring Dish's frightened and skeptical townsfolk, referenced, as a metaphor, the ancient Roman practices of roadside crucifixion and burning villages to deter violators. Attorneys are familiar with such historical touchstones which are routinely invoked by law professors and \"tough on crime\" prosecutors to illustrate the concept of deterrence. If Armedariz had been speaking about any other crime than pollution from fracking, and any type of alleged criminal other than certain oil frackers, the same republican lawmakers would have applauded his muscular commitment to merciless rigor.From its inception, hydrofracking has been an outlaw enterprise. The industry was born in a provision drafted in secret by oilman Dick Cheney's clandestine energy task force specifically exempting it from the Safe Drinking Water Act, a shale fracking method devised and patented by Cheney's former company Halliburton. The Vice President's henchmen then rammed the exemption though a supplicant post 9/11 Congress. Rough and tumble competition among fracking companies have turned the frack fields from North Dakota to Pennsylvania into modern Dodge Cities. Regulatory capture has given some of the industry's worst actors de facto immunity from their criminal behavior.In states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the fracking industry has flourished through habitual law breaking, including illegal dumping of horrendous toxins into public sewage treatment plants utterly unequipped to treat those poisons, using substandard casing protocols that regularly contaminate people's groundwater with carcinogenic benzene and explosive methane, and illegally filling streams to build roads, pipelines and drill pads. These species of habitual lawbreakers require the protection of crooked politicians and captive agencies to insulate criminal companies from the consequences of their illegal behavior. Oil companies are experts at using campaign contributions to purchase this class of government cooperation.In another demonstration of its impressive power, two days after Dr. Al's resignation, the frack industry won another political battle -- forcing cowed Interior Department officials to allow gas companies to frack on our federal public lands without first disclosing the constituents of the lethal fracking fluid, they intend to inject into our purple mountains' majesty and amber waves of grain.Later that week, AP reporters documented how the frack industry was using its clout to escape, not just the laws of government, but of science. On Thursday, AP's investigators forced the U.S. EPA to admit that it had withheld -- for nearly a month -- a devastating study showing groundwater contamination linked to fracking from oil and gas wells in Pavillion, Wyoming. At the command of Wyoming's republican Governor Matt Mead -- an indentured servant to the fracking industry -- the EPA delayed issuing the report. Mead then ordered state officials to \"take a hard line\" on the industry's behalf. A team of tobacco scientists and biostitutes at Wyoming's Department of Environmental Quality next dutifully used the delay to gin up critical questions meant to debunk EPA's science to help soften the blow from the federal study that sent shock waves through the oil and gas industry.Law-abiding gas patch residents like the citizens of Dish, Texas understand something that Congressional Republicans apparently don't -- environmental crime is real crime with real victims. Pollution doesn't just attack water and wildlife and put fishermen out of work. It harms human health, private property and often takes human life. Oil pollution damages the brains of little children and kills both young people and adults. Emissions from burning oil and coal kills tens of thousands Americans annually from cancer and respiratory illnesses, and impose half a trillion dollars in health care damage.Oil and coal's other costs include global warming, acid rain, mercury contamination and ocean acidification. The carbon cronies have demonstrated an uncanny talent for writing loopholes and exemptions into health, safety and environmental laws to escape the consequences of damaging private property, public health, the shared commons and the welfare of the American people. When their lobbying and drafting tricks fail to give oil titans full protection, compliant enforcement and regulatory officials dull the sting of noncompliance. It's no wonder that frightened gas field communities seek assurance that government regulators will enforce the anemic laws that still exist to protect them. In the southern gulf states, Armendariz was respected by coastal communities as one of the few public officials who had not been corrupted by Big Oil. In that sense, Armendariz is an American hero in the mold of Eliott Ness, Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp and Thomas Dewey.Unfortunately, most of our political leaders lack Dr. Al's courage and integrity. Instead of protecting America's citizenry from oil industry atrocities, Senator Inhofe and the republicans see their job as protecting oil company brigands from the law and its enforcers. Inhofe's reasoning is not obscure, the oil and gas industry pumps hundreds of millions of dollars annually into elections and lobbying to purchase friends like Senator Inhofe. Big Oil is now the richest industry in history. Last year, Exxon contributed $54 million to the political process. The gravities of this lucre are irresistible to politicians of a certain stripe. Exxon's record quarterly profits of $104 million per day will allow that company to dramatically increase its political investments. More importantly, the Supreme Court's Citizens United case removes all the past restrictions that once deterred Big Oil from employing these enormous profits to completely dominate America's political system. As a result of that court ruling, the oil barons will pick the winners and losers in America's upcoming elections at every level -- in secret if they desire.The industry is already poised to flood America's political landscapes with hundreds of millions of dollars in newly legalized bribery. In addition to their generous contribution to the Tea Party, CATO Institute and other oil industry front groups, and oil tycoons Charles and David Koch, on Feb. 3 pledged an extra $60 million of their private money for direct campaign donations to ensure that their oil friendly candidate wins the presidential election in November.Chevron, Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute and other oil moguls will match the Koch brothers' largesse many times over. The oil barons must find great comfort in historic data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics demonstrating that, in 94% of American elections, the candidate with the most money wins. It was the underlying idealism of our successful experiment with self-government that made America an exemplary nation and the template for the world's democracies. If American democracy is to survive, we clearly need to restore integrity and representative democracy to our electoral process and get control of an industry that is using its enormous financial power to enrich itself, destroy the planet and undermine everything we value. Last week's events are merely a foreshadowing of the devolution that is inexorably propelling us toward a corrupt venal and petro kleptocracy."}, {"title": "Club Of Rome Climate Change Report Predicts 2 Degree Celsius Warming By 2052", "text": "* Carbon emissions will cause 2 degree Celsius rise by 2052* Rise of 2.8 degrees seen by 2080By Nina ChestneyLONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Rising carbon dioxide emissions will cause a global average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius by 2052 and a 2.8 degree rise by 2080, as governments and markets are unlikely to do enough against climate change, the Club of Rome think tank said.Failing to tackle climate change in the first half of this century will put the world on a dangerous track to warming in the second half, even though global population should peak in 2042 at 8.1 billion and economic growth will be much slower than expected in mature economies, the Switzerland-based body said in a report on Tuesday.\"It is unlikely that governments will pass necessary regulation to force the markets to allocate more money into climate-friendly solutions, and (we) must not assume that markets will work for the benefit of humankind,\" said Jorgen Randers, author of the report.\"We are emitting twice as much greenhouse gases every year as are absorbed by the world's forests and oceans. This overshoot will worsen and will peak in 2030.\"In 2010, countries agreed that deep emissions cuts had to be made to keep an increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century.The Club of Rome report sees the 2 degree threshold being reached not at the end of the century, as many forecasters warn, but much sooner.Scientists say that crossing this threshold risks an unstable climate in which weather extremes are common but efforts so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions are not seen as sufficient to stop a rise beyond 2 degrees this century.CONSUMPTIONBy 2052, China's per capita consumption will be at least two thirds that of the United States, while the average economic growth of 14 emerging nations including Brazil, India and South Africa, will treble over the next 40 years, Randers said.\"This growth will improve living standards for many, but it will come at a cost for the global climate. While growth will not be as explosive as in China, it will still be heavy enough to keep emissions from these nations growing until the 2040s,\" he added.By contrast, the mature economies of the United States and Europe will see declining or stable consumption, which should help prevent the depletion of oil, food and water by 2052.Last year, the United Nations' Environment Programme said the gap between countries' emissions cut pledges and what was needed to remain under 2 degrees had widened and emissions in 2020 would rise to between 6 billion and 11 billion tonnes over what is needed to limit global warming to safe levels.The International Energy Agency also warned that the world may not be able to limit temperature rise if new international climate action is not taken by 2017 as so many fossil fuel power plants and factories are being built.A new global climate pact forcing the world's biggest polluters, including the United States and China, to curb emissions will only be agreed on by 2015 - to enter into force by 2020 - seen by many as too late to limit climate damage.Countries have agreed to raise $10 billion a year in aid from 2010-12 to help developing nations adapt to climate change, rising to $100 billion a year by 2020.But the economic downturn has constrained government funds, and carbon markets, which should incentivise clean energy investment in the private sector, are failing to deliver.

Kellen's dreams, she said, weren't confined to the limits of his hometown, Jonesboro, Ga., a predominantly minority, low-income community about 20 miles south of Atlanta.Much like its bigger neighbor to the north, and a number of other cities across the country, Jonesboro has long faced air pollution problems.\"We know that air quality is unacceptable in many places,\" said Christopher Paul, a graduate student in environmental policy at Duke University. \"This is just one of a number of assaults on children's well-being that makes it harder to lead healthy, successful lives.\"Paul is a researcher on a study published last year that describes disparities in air quality around the U.S. By pairing census data with air pollution levels from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's monitoring network, his team found that low-income and minority groups -- in particular, poor children of color -- tend to be most exposed to air pollution.Disadvantaged kids not only breathe disproportionate amounts bad air, but they also can be more vulnerable to the ill effects of that bad air. As The Huffington Post reported in March, asthma is likely the most notorious of these ailments. Nearly one in four Hispanic and Puerto Rican kids living in poverty in the U.S. has been diagnosed with the condition that can cause wheezing, coughing, breathlessness and chest tightness, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares with about one in 13 middle-class or wealthy white children. (The agency also reports similar disparities in exposures to air pollution.)Air pollution, Mitchell said, was a major trigger for Kellen's asthma. \"On smoggy days, it seemed like he couldn't ever get enough air,\" she said, noting that the avid football player stayed indoors when these dangerous conditions hit Jonesboro.Just why lower income families more commonly reside in places with dirty air is not clear, said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of national policy and advocacy at the American Lung Association, which released its annual State of the Air report last month. Power plants and industrial boilers might be constructed in poor neighborhoods. Or it may be that areas housing such facilities, or that are bordered by heavily trafficked roads, simply offer cheaper housing. Researchers recently traced back the historical influx of African Americans into western Louisville, Ky., and found that this occurred after the arrival of polluting industries that gave the area its nickname of \"Rubbertown\".\"Richer neighborhoods are not necessarily built near major highways or downwind from factories,\" noted Nolen.Regardless, the differences in how much toxic air children breathe may not be the only explanation for the disparities in air pollution-related children's health problems, experts said. Take, for example, the city blocks that extend north and south of East 96th Street in Manhattan, New York, the rough dividing line between the neighborhoods of East Harlem and the Upper East Side.Nearly one of every three kids in East Harlem suffers from asthma. In the more affluent Upper East Side, the rate is less than 10 percent. Yet both neighborhoods have been found to have poor air quality due in large part to diesel truck and bus traffic and old buildings that still burn dirty heating oil.How could kids living within walking distance of one another face such disparate risks?\"You have to layer the air pollution on top of other existing social disparities,\" explained Cecil Corbin-Mark, deputy director for the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental justice. \"What happens when a child has an asthma attack? How does that impact families income? These are domino-like effects that can flow from these bad air quality situations in our neighborhoods.\"Disadvantaged populations may lack access to health care, grocery stores and good jobs. Add to that the underlying chronic stress that comes with living in poverty, which researchers are finding might further increase susceptibility to conditions that include asthma, heart disease and cancer.Poorer communities may also be more likely to encounter other environmental exposures, including contaminated water and toxic wastes. Indoor pollutants, such as cigarette smoke and cockroach droppings, are associated with both poverty and asthma as well.\u201cThere might be multiple steps in the development of asthma. Diesel particles can encourage someone\u2019s immune system to have an allergic response,\u201d said Matt Perzanowski, an environmental health scientist at Columbia University and researcher on a recent study that found higher rates of childhood asthma in New York City neighborhoods that had more black carbon pollution in the air as well as a greater presence of cockroach and mouse allergens. Once a kid has asthma, Perzanowski added, such allergens may be triggers of asthma attacks.Of course, a child living in a pest-free home on the Upper East Side, who may not have to think about where his or her next meal will come from, is not immune to air pollution's threats.The Passons live in an affluent suburb about 20 miles north of Atlanta. The family spoke out alongside Kellen's mom at an asthma awareness event last week in Atlanta. Brennan Passons, 11, died of asthma in October.\"Brennan and Kellen are on two opposite ends of the spectrum. But it's not just one income group or demographic. Asthma affects everyone,\" Tim Passons, Brennan's dad, told The Huffington Post. \"It naturally makes you wonder. Why is it that 10 percent of the kids in Georgia have asthma? Certainly the environment has something to do with it.\"While most attention, including the American Lung Association report, focuses on ozone (smog) and particle pollution (soot), scientists are finding that specific air pollutants such as PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and mercury pose a number of dangers to babies in the womb and young children -- from future obesity to cognitive problems. The pollutants tend to stem from the same sources, namely power plants, said Nolen.The EPA has recently targeted sources of unhealthy air with new rules that restrict cross-state air pollution, strengthen mercury and air toxics standards and limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Should they withstand opposition from some members of congress and industry, 540,000 asthma attacks will be prevented each year. The proposed carbon restrictions could further decrease asthma's death toll. The biggest beneficiaries: disadvantaged groups.The EPA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is increasing its focus on environmental justice issues in urban areas, as well as rural communities and Indian tribes that often fall off the radar.\"We need to target these worse-off neighborhoods,\" said Duke\u2019s Paul. \"By acting on pollution in places that have the highest burden, we will both be reducing the worst polluted areas and reducing disparities.\"Locally, cities that include New York and Atlanta are pushing to reduce the number of idling trucks and the use of hazardous heating oils. \"But the date for that to take effect is still well ahead of us,\" noted Corbin-Mark, referring to pending legislation that would phase-out the dirtiest heating oils from New York City buildings.\"While people are working on green answers to air pollution, which can take a long time, we don't want to wait,\" said Sarah Passons, who along with her husband and Rhonda Mitchell are helping to educate parents on how to protect their asthmatic children today. Sarah's recommendation: \"Always have an EpiPen on you at all times, know how to use it and teach your children how to use it.\" An EpiPen is an injector filled with epinephrine, which relaxes airways in an allergic or asthma attack.Kellen always knew his name would some day be \"up in lights,\" added Rhonda Mitchell. She suggested that his dream is coming true, albeit not in a way he might have anticipated. His story is helping other kids have a better chance at a healthy life."}, {"title": "1,4-Dioxane and Laundry Soap: Free and Gentle or a Marketing Free-for-All?", "text": "More than 80,000 chemicals are produced, used, and present in the United States. This is one of their stories.\"Free of dyes and perfumes\" on the label doesn't mean \"free of carcinogens.\"Independent Testing Reveals Undisclosed IngredientsRecently The New York Times' Green blog raised the spotlight on a report released last November on toxic chemicals found in 20 popular cleaning products. Women's Voices for the Earth, a national environmental group based in Missoula, Mont., had commissioned independent tests on all-purpose cleaners, laundry detergents, dryer sheets, air fresheners, disinfectant sprays, and furniture polish made by Clorox, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, SC Johnson, and Sunshine Makers. The testing revealed that a number of the products had chemicals that are known to be allergens or are linked to reproductive and endocrine disruption... and cancer.I have to say the findings do not come as a huge surprise. Previous work (see here and here) has documented the ubiquity of toxic chemicals in everyday consumer products. It's not even that surprising that some of these compounds are absent from product labels. What may be surprising is that the language used to market some of these toxic-containing products suggests that they would be anything but toxic-containing.Today's post focuses on one such example: the presence of 1,4-dioxane in laundry detergent. Should you be concerned about this? You'll have to decide.1,4-Dioxane: What It Is and Why It MattersThe chemical in question, whose toxicological profile is provided in a 2007 draft in the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \"is a clear liquid with a faint pleasant odor [that] mixes easily with water.\" A synthetic industrial chemical, 1,4-dioxane has many uses as a solvent and a stabilizer in manufacturing, especially in the making of chemicals, plastics, pesticides, food additives, and pharmaceuticals. It's also a contaminant produced in the manufacture of surfactants used in cosmetics, detergents, and shampoos.Laboratory studies (see here) have established that chronic exposure to 1,4-dioxane can cause cancer in mice and rats, but there is as yet no specific evidence establishing a causal relationship between 1,4-dioxane and cancer in humans. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency lists it as \"likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concurs: \"1,4-dioxane is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.\"In really high doses, 1,4-dioxane can be really bad news. According to the Health and Human Services agency, current data \"are sufficient to clearly identify the liver and kidneys as the target organs for 1,4-dioxane toxicity following short-term exposure to relatively high amounts\" of it via ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. Acute exposure to excessive but undetermined concentrations in the workplace has resulted in death.Are We Exposed to the Stuff?The good news is that unless you work in or live very close to a plant where 1,4-dioxane is produced, it is highly unlikely that you will ever be exposed to levels sufficient to cause acute distress.But what about lower levels of exposure -- not enough to kill you right away, but perhaps enough to eventually cause cancer? On that front the news is not that encouraging. Because, If you live in the United States and eat and breathe, you are probably exposed to it.1,4-dioxane has been observed in ambient air with generally higher concentrations indoors than outdoors (see this 1986 study). The Health and Human Services Department reports that \"tap water can contain 1,4-dioxane, so you also can be exposed to 1,4-dioxane during activities such as showering, bathing, and laundering,\" and that \"drinking water containing 1,4-dioxane\" is one of the \"primary routes of human exposure.\" It may also come to us through our food -- as residues on pesticide-treated crops (such as vine ripened tomatoes), in manufactured additives, and on some packaging materials. The Centers for Disease Control puts it succinctly: \"people are exposed to 1,4-dioxane every day because of its widespread use in medicines, shampoo, cosmetics, detergents, and household items.\"Government Regulations Not to the RescueSo we're all exposed to some 1,4-dioxane. Is it enough to make us sick? I don't think anyone knows for sure. But all those exposures from air, water, and food can accumulate. It almost surely is not good for you. So surely the federal government, with its job-killing, power-grabbing, regulation-crazed agencies like the EPA and Food and Drug Administration, has stepped in and banned the stuff, right? Actually, not very much at all.There are no federal regulations on 1,4-dioxane for drinking water. There are no federal regulations for ambient air concentrations (although there are workplace regulations in effect for ambient and dermal exposure). There is an FDA-imposed, 10-parts-per-million limit in food and drugs.And there are no federal limits for 1,4-dioxane in consumer products. Claims by the Health and Human Services agency and others that the FDA has placed a limit in cosmetics have been denied by none other than the FDA.So the feds may not be on the case, but the Golden State is, sort of. California's Proposition 65 establishes a safe daily exposure of 30 micrograms (max) as part of its Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act. To avoid triggering the law's labeling requirement, in at least one instance the state set a limit on 1,4-dioxane of 10 parts per million for dish soap.What's the Story With Consumer Products?The apparent reason that the federal government is silent on 1,4-dioxane in most consumer products is its view that the process of \"vacuum stripping\" has rendered it a non-issue: \"Manufacturers now reduce 1,4-dioxane from these chemicals to low levels before these chemicals are made into products used in the home.\" A 2005 report by the Department of Health and Human Services states:[B]etween ... 1992 and 1997, the average concentration of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetic finished products was reported to fluctuate from 14 to 79 [parts per million]. ... Current levels of 1,4-dioxane in consumer products are much lower since that time because manufacturers are once again taking action to remove much of the 1,4-dioxane.This conclusion, that 1,4-dioxane was once a concern but is no longer, is proliferated on the Web -- from blogs (see here and here) to other federal groups (such as the EPA and the military). Is it really no longer a concern?Enter Women's Voices for the EarthAmong the undisclosed ingredients that the recent study by the Missoula-based group turned up was 1,4-dioxane in four products:That's right, two Tide products, made by Procter and Gamble, had 1,4-dioxane concentrations at the high end of what was typical in the 1990s -- levels that were supposedly a thing of the past. (Note: There are likely more products than these containing the chemical; the study only looked at 20 products.)Now, before running into the laundry and dumping that bottle of Tide, you might reflect a bit. Since you don't actually put laundry detergent on your skin, and because 1,4-dioxane is miscible in water, just because the chemical is in your detergent does not mean you end being exposed to much.But even so, you might reasonably conclude that you'd rather not mess with the stuff at all. And if that's your preference, remember that reading the label to check whether your detergent contains 1,4-dioxane won't help -- because it's a byproduct, it's generally not listed. And here's the real drag -- you read \"Free and Gentle\" on the bottle and you might well think that bottle is not just \"free of dyes and perfumes\" but also free of carcinogens, especially carcinogens that the manufacturer knows are there and and that it can readily remove. Alas, as they say, you can't know a consumer product by its hype.This piece is cross-posted with TheGreenGrok.* * * * *"}, {"title": "Could A Changing Climate Set Off Volcanoes And Quakes?", "text": "Geological disasters might influence climate, for instance when volcanic debris blots out the sun.

Perhaps best of all, the waste from one part of farm serves as raw material for another, making it a net-zero energy system, according to Arch Daily.

Sorry to be so blunt about it -- but could the answer, at least in part, be as simple as a dating service designed to connect animals in shelters with the families anxious to adopt them?Pets are big business. According to the American Pet Products Association, in 2011 the pet market was worth $51 billion. Tech and social media are poised to get a slice of that pie. A study released last year suggests that 1 in 10 pets have a social media profile. The paying pet market is seeing a splash of tech start-ups designed to meet the needs of pets and owners.  Dog Vacay recently launched in San Francisco and was described by Mashable as \"the AirBnB for dogs.\" The site offers vetted alternatives to kennel stays and has been a huge hit. The company is also dipping a toe into the dog walking and dog grooming fields through its concierge services.Other sites are popping up to facilitate doggy play dates. Matchpuppy recently launched in NYC, and connects dogs and owners with suitable companions. The profiles ask for details like energy level, breed and tidbits about personality. Owners then coordinate meet ups based on what they are looking for - such as other small, calm dogs or a rough and tumble Labrador looking for a swimming partner.But how do we transition the incredible power of tech minds to solving the issue of homeless pets? It brings to mind the Westminster Dog Show fiasco earlier this year, when they fired their ads partner of 24 years Pedigree because they felt that their adoption themed ads were \"too depressing.\" There's obvious money to be made in the pet industry; the financial return on a site geared to helping animals in shelters is harder to figure out -- but it's not impossible.Animal welfare has largely been confined to the space of philanthropy. We think in terms of donations and volunteering; these are important. But our understanding of what entrepreneurship can achieve as a society is evolving. Social entrepreneurs are applying business tactics to solve societal issues all over the world, every day. And many entrepreneurs understand that they can build businesses that contribute to the public good while still turning a profit. We've figured out profitable ways to bring clean water to remote villages in developing countries, and make computers available to children around the globe. Surely we can take this innovation one step further and make a serious dent in the problem of homeless pets.The technology itself could be quite simple. Harnessing Petfinder's massive database of pets in shelters and foster homes across the country, and building on simple dating site functionality with compatibility criteria could simplify the pet adoption process. Imagine this: a streamlined service that emails Joe, \"an avid runner in New York looking for a mid-size, active dog that's house trained\" when a suitable candidate \"Bruce the Pitt-Bull Beagle mix that weighs 35lbs and is looking for a running partner appears.\"What about a site that allowed would be adopters to fill out a single adoption application that could then be used by any participating shelter? A common frustration among potential adopters is that you may look at a few candidates in the course of finding the right pet to add to your family. Each time, you're often required to fill out a multipage application. This step could be eliminated with a Monster.com like functionality -- create an adoption application that can then be easily shared with any shelters with resident animals you're interested in meeting. Consider the possibility of an app that integrated shelter inventory with Google maps, and notified you that there was a beautiful basenji (that you'd previously indicated you'd love to meet) at a shelter a one minute walk from your current location.Sites like Petfinder, AdoptaPet and ASPCA.org are doing incredible work.

Without help, more than two-thirds of these amazing animals, including all the polar bears in Alaska, will likely be gone by 2050 -- driven off the planet by diminishing sea ice.So it boggles the mind that the Obama administration recently announced plans to reissue a Bush-era regulation that sharply limits protections for polar bears under the Endangered Species Act.Unless the public speaks out forcefully, the regulation will go into effect -- and that could be the last straw for this magnificent species.President Obama's \"Polar Bear Extinction Plan\" has a disturbing history. It was a sobering but also promising moment in 2008 when polar bears were the first species added to the threatened species list solely because of threats from global warming.The bear's new status meant that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had to provide measures for the animal's conservation. It's not rocket science to conclude that if polar bears are to survive we have to start reducing greenhouse gas pollution to slow the warming and melting of the Arctic.It wasn't too surprising that the Bush administration, which opposed any regulation of greenhouse gases, grudgingly acknowledged that polar bears are in deep trouble and yet refused to address the very thing that threatens their survival: greenhouse gas pollution. It did this by issuing a \"special rule\" that gave the polar bear fewer protections than other species and specifically exempted greenhouse gas emissions from important Endangered Species Act programs that would have helped reduce them.Last fall, a federal judge found that the rule was illegal because the Fish and Wildlife Service hadn't considered the environmental consequences of the decision. The judge told the agency it must re-consider the issue.And now the Obama administration has just proposed reissuing the exact same Bush rule: It acknowledges that polar bears are listed under the Endangered Species Act because of global warming but then prevents action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the name of saving polar bears.It makes no sense. A conservation plan that blocks the very actions needed to save polar bears is no conservation plan at all: it's an extinction plan.And adopting nonsensical Bush decisions as his own to avoid addressing the climate crisis is not the change President Obama promised.There is very little time left to save polar bears. But there is hope. We know what needs to be done, we have the technology to reduce emissions, and we already have strong, successful laws on the books that can make it happen.But the government needs to stop dreaming up excuses for delay and instead get to work. Convincing the Fish and Wildlife Service to drop this misguided extinction plan for polar bears and replace it with a rule that provides for real conservation is an important step.

I am becoming aware of my every movement, the tone of my voice while on the phone. I am being watched. I have a shadow that needs me to constantly let him know that he is safe and loved. What a wonderful thing to be to a dog.Naja loves to be photographed, and he had a lot of supporters that wanted updates about him. And so he became the most photographed dog in the house. My other dogs got a little jealous, so I had to take photos of them, too.Naja is the little son I never had. (Go ahead, Dr. Phil, have fun with that line!) But really, he is. He plays all day and then, close to bedtime, his little eyes can barely stay open. Once in bed he loves to go under the covers, and then he is out for the night. In the morning, he gives a little grunt when the alarm goes off, but is up and ready for the new day as I head downstairs. It has been over six months since I adopted Naja, and he is no longer nervous or worried; he trusts me with his life. If anything is going on, like if another dog chewed something they shouldn't have or I seem a bit stressed from my day at work, Naja greets me with a toy in his mouth, smiling face and wagging tail, saying \"It's OK, Ma, don't sweat the small stuff , let's play.

Exxon, Koch and their industry allies have swallowed the Republican Party whole while seeding a complex of Big Carbon think tanks, climate-change-denying scientists, lobby shops and astro-turf right-wing social movements.The energy industry straitjacket impedes the adoption of national policies that have fostered growth in solar, wind, biomass and geothermal systems in much of the industrialized world. Although renewable efforts in states like Iowa and California have kept the U.S. on the map in the wind and solar sectors, our lagging position in renewable energy innovation, along with the dependence that comes from our chronic over-consumption of fossil fuels, contributes to American anomie -- the palpable sense that the nation is rapidly losing ground on almost every front in an era of resource scarcity and financial instability.In Germany, where the stranglehold of corporate energy has been loosened, renewables now comprise 20 percent, of national energy production, thanks to national policies such as feed-in tariffs which guarantee a stable price for power produced by wind, solar and geothermal systems. More than half of German energy is now produced in decentralized sites like homes, farms and community co-ops. This trend toward distributed generation conflicts directly with the corporate energy paradigm of centralized control.The German model shows that national policies can have a transformative impact that both increases overall renewable energy production while placing ownership in the hands of farmers, small businesses and homeowners.Renewables Rise at the GrassrootsWhile the oil and gas lobby dominates at the federal level, communities across the United States are making great strides in gaining control of energy production by advancing an impressive range of commercial-scale renewable projects that are heating homes and powering local businesses from Massachusetts to Oregon. Municipal utilities, community-based co-ops, universities and other nonprofit institutions in both rural and urban settings are executing wind, solar, geothermal and biomass developments.When combined with the innovative grassroots efforts to retrofit existing buildings for conservation purposes, these renewable energy production programs are placing community-led efforts at the forefront of American innovation. In the process, they are creating a blueprint that could be used to scale-up nationally when and if we develop a rational Federal energy policy fostering both the growth of the renewable sector and democratization of production on the German model.In Hull, Mass., residents began a campaign to build large-scale wind turbines in 1996. The first turbine was completed in late 2001 and has produced more than 12 million kilowatts to date. A second, larger turbine, known as Hull II, was erected on top of the town's former landfill in 2006 and in its first year produced enough electricity to power all of the Hull's street lights while providing the town with an additional $150,000 from the sale of excess electricity. Hull's two turbines now generate enough electricity to power 1,100 homes as well as the town's street and traffic lights.Similar community-controlled wind projects have sprouted up across the state of Iowa, placing seven municipalities and about a dozen school districts in control of their energy destinies. The 1.65 megawatt wind farm at Iowa Lakes Community College is among the largest of these community-developed projects, built in conjunction with the ILCC's launch of the first accredited wind turbine training program in the nation.The Iowa Lakes Electric Cooperative, which operates independently of the college, provides power to more than 12,000 member-owners in eight rural Iowa counties and has developed two wind farms that generate more than 21 megawatts, projects for which it was named wind cooperative of the year by the DOE.In the realm of community-controlled solar energy, the city of San Francisco, propelled by a citizens movement called Vote Solar, set a new standard for municipal generation with the opening of the Sunset Reservoir development, which includes over 24,000 panels and will generate 5 megawatts daily, tripling the city's solar output and solidifying the municipal utility's ability to meet 100% of the city's electricity needs without burning any greenhouse gases.San Francisco is also at the forefront of incentivizing residents to produce their own solar power, with rebates of up to $10,000 for residential customers. In 2009, the program's first year, solar installations increased 450%, with more than 800 homeowners taking part.Solar innovation is also happening in the less cosmopolitan environs of Drake Landing, Alberta, a small town that became the first community on the continent to construct a district heating system powered by the sun. The Drake Landing system pumps solar-heated water through insulated piping flowing to all 52 of the town's homes.District co-generation plants, which produce heat and electrical energy simultaneously for distribution in nearby communities and large institutions, are increasingly turning to renewables for generation. The largest such system is Minnesota's District Energy St. Paul, which relies on biomass as its primary fuel. Last year, the nonprofit corporation integrated 144 roof-mounted solar panels into its generation system. All told, District Energy St. Paul heats more than 185 office buildings and 300 homes in downtown St. Paul.The University of New Hampshire has adopted similar co-generation technology, powered by methane emitted from an adjacent landfill, to meet 100 percent of its electricity and heating needs, without burning any carbon-based fuels.At the community level, grassroots leaders are adapting renewable technologies to meet the needs of their neighborhoods. The Community Power Network has emerged as an association of energy co-operatives and advocacy groups committed to democratizing power production. Affiliated groups include DC Solar United, an alliance of neighborhood-based solar co-operatives in DC; the JOBS project, bringing renewables and green jobs trainings to the heart of Appalachian coal country; and GRID Alternatives, which leads solar installation projects in low-income communities across California.As renewables are harnessed to meet the heat and power needs of more communities each year, they are proving their viability as greener and more democratic alternatives to the fossil fuel monoliths. The choice between ever more invasive and insidious extraction techniques -- fracking in Marcellus, mountaintop removal in Appalachia and tar sand processing in Alberta -- controlled by mega corporations and the adoption of community-based wind, solar, geothermal and biomass systems is stark.In the absence of sensible federal policy, some states and cities are taking the lead in supporting the growth of renewables by instituting Feed-in Tariffs (FITs), which establish stable price supports for power that enters the grid from renewable sources. Ontario's FIT has spurred the creation of more than 20,000 green jobs in the wind and solar sectors while recently passed FITs in Vermont, Hawaii and Oregon are showing early gains.Ultimately, our energy choices will be determined in state capitals and municipalities as community advocates and their allies battle industry lobbyists and their minions in industry-funded think tanks. The competitiveness of our national economy and the health of our global habitat lie in the balance."}, {"title": "Canada's Economy: Pipeline Approval Necessary To Boost Employment, Government Says", "text": "* Endless debate on projects is unacceptable - minister* Environmental measures included in omnibus budget bill* Opposition says inclusion undermines political debateOTTAWA, May 7 (Reuters) - Canadian government measures to speed up environmental approvals for pipelines and other major projects are crucial to help expand the economy and boost employment, Natural Resources Joe Oliver said on Monday.\"The need for this legislation is urgent,\" Oliver told reporters outside the House of Commons. \"The world will not stand by and wait while Canada endlessly deliberates the merits of its resource potential and squanders its legacy.\"The environmental measures have been folded into an omnibus budget implementation bill, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups who say the move would short-circuit political debate.\"There is no transparency, no accountability,\" Nathan Cullen, House leader for the opposition New Democratic Party, said as he asked the Conservative government to separate out the environmental components from the budget bill.In his remarks to reporters, Oliver said a finance subcommittee would be set up to deal separately and openly with the measures for what the government calls \"responsible resource development.\"Finance Minister Jim Flaherty defended the inclusion of diverse issues in the budget legislation. \"A large budget begets a large budget implementation bill,\" he told the House.The Conservatives say the current regulatory system is too complex and can lead to development projects being held up for a decade or more, but ecologists say anything less risks serious damage to the environment.Citing estimates from the Canadian Energy Research Institute, Oliver said proposed pipeline expansion and projected oil output increases would generate 700,000 jobs on average over the next 25 years and add C$3.3 trillion ($3.3 trillion) in economic activity.($1=$0.99 Canadian) (Reporting by Randall Palmer; Editing by Frank McGurty)"}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Ancient Global Warming, Powering Houses With Cars, and More", "text": "Exploding carbon dioxide levels, marine dead zones, ocean acidification, rising temperatures? \"Been there, done that,\" says Earth through the voices of fossil cells -- and it wiped out most life on the planet about 250 million years ago, concludes scientists deciphering those cellular messages, reports Alanna Mitchell at The New York Times.At a time when climate change is worsening, U.S. budget cuts are decreasing monitoring of climate change, weather and natural disasters, reports Rachel Nuwer at The New York Times.\"Honey, the power went off... can you switch on the car?\" might be a common future refrain, as people use electric cars to power houses during blackouts -- which will likely increase from more extreme weather under continuing climate change, explains Michael Lemonick at Climate Central.

And while more municipalities are allowing food waste to be included in green waste, that practice still has a while to scale. But a composting process with origins in Korea and now used in Japan for 30 years offers an option for the sustainable disposal of food waste.Bokashi is a method of composting that can work for people who already live as green as possible in their small space but have no option to eliminate those pesky food scraps.Bokashi composting is an effective, seamless and quick way to compost food waste in one\u2019s home. In Japanese, Bokashi means \u201cfermented organic matter.\u201d Technically, the process is more fermentation than actual composting. Bokashi uses a particular group of microorganisms to anaerobically break down food waste. One advantage of the Bokashi system is that it can break down foods like meat, fish and dairy products that not only give off a rancid smell, but take a long time to break down. If done correctly, Bokashi can result in compost in as little as two weeks, depending on the local climate and soil biology.Give Your Trash Can a Break: Wow, I Can Compost That?Another key to Bokashi\u2019s success in the creation of compost is the wheat bran that is included in a composting kit. When opening the bag, the bran smells sweet like molasses. That sweetness soon turns into a mild pickled oder that is barely noticeable. Furthermore, the entire process occurs in an enclosed bin, which not only prevents odors from leaking, but also prevents rodents and other pests like insects from stealing your compost for dinner.Layering is an important step in the Bokashi process. After an inch or so food scraps is spread in the bucket, users just need to sprinkle the bran on the food scraps. The process continues until the bin is full. Meanwhile any water that collects in the bin can be drained, diluted and poured into the ground to fertilized plants. Undiluted liquid can clear sink drains or septic systems. Once the fermented matter is ready, the compost can be added to a garden. The one caveat is that the finished product must be buried in order for it to turn into humus that in turn will revive the soil.I saw Bokashi in action in the Middle East. During a trip to Dubai, I met Annette Duke, an administrative assistant at an international school. Long passionate about the environment but frustrated with few options to compost or recycle, Duke purchased a Bokashi kit through a local retailer. Composting is a huge challenge in Dubai in part because of the determined desert rats that will demolish a compost bin in a heartbeat.Related: Making Progress in Dubai\u2019s Recycling DesertThe extreme summer heat is also not conducive to composting. Then add the fact that most of Dubai\u2019s environment is artificial: gardens in homes like the one in which Duke lives require massive amounts of top soil to be hauled in and spread above the desert sand.But for Duke, the Bokashi process works and is a step in making her home a touch more sustainable. Now she and her husband, Paul Leslie, an educator at a local university, are composting and fermenting everything from tea bags to date pits to coffee grounds. And now she is creating a small cottage industry as she has her friends who live in apartments Bokashi so her garden of drought resistant grasses and flowers can thrive.Take Composting to the Next Level: Poetree Planter Offers Green Burial Alternative"}, {"title": "Paint Recycling Picks Up Steam", "text": "There\u2019s really no way around it.

They're rare, but they're there. The spinach E. coli outbreak that happened quite a few years ago is one example. It made national news and sparked a well-intentioned, but drastic reaction, including a literal scorched-earth approach to lands surrounding farms. For sure, the consequences of foodborne illness can be devastating, and we need to deal with the problem. But a smart, science-based approach can help us make sure our response actually addresses the sources of risk, and doesn't create more problems than it solves. The FDA is working on new produce safety rules (due to be released this spring) that are a great opportunity to be thoughtful about the connection between our food and the land it's grown on.There are countless benefits to having farms nested in natural landscapes. Natural landscapes produce healthy pollinators such as bees. They filter runoff and sediment from agricultural fields before they pollute our rivers. And they can serve as windbreaks that keep dust out of the air and out of local lungs. These are among the pretty well-known upsides to having farms close to nature, and we've been benefiting from them since we discovered agriculture.But it turns out some people think nature is dirty. In the past, produce buyers and retailers have responded to foodborne illness outbreaks by demanding new food-safety practices on farms aimed at keeping wildlife out. Some leafy-green buyers, for example, have driven growers to clear all vegetation around farms -- \"bare earth buffers,\" they call them. Other practices include putting poison bait stations in and around fields, poisoning ponds, and even building fences that keep out frogs. Likewise, many growers are being forced to abandon long-standing conservation measures like recycling irrigation water and restoring streams.Buyers and producers all want to do the right thing and address a real issue. But while these sorts of tactics might make it look like we're addressing the problem, we don't even know if they work. In many cases it's not been established that wild animals are the source of the problem in the first place. The practices are also very expensive, especially for small farmers. It's essentially a \"shock and awe\" approach to a problem that requires a lot more precision. We need to be thoughtful and driven by actual science and data that show precisely where food-safety hazards and risks come from -- and how best to mitigate them.In the Salinas Valley on California's central coast, we're figuring out how to grow food safely, without unraveling the entire ecosystem. Salinas is a farming powerhouse. Any salad greens you eat most likely come from that valley. What we learn there can affect farming across the country. The Nature Conservancy helped develop a report called \"Safe and Sustainable: Co-managing for Food Safety and Ecological Health in California's Central Coast Region.\" It recommends that we use science to figure out the best ways to improve food safety while keeping the environment healthy. With smart approaches, we can reduce the risk of foodborne illness and avoid unnecessarily degrading the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of all living things in the landscape: people, wildlife, and plants.These new food-safety rules are really important, and I hope the FDA takes a thoughtful approach.

But these little fish provide essential food for all the marine life that we like to catch, eat or watch. Unfortunately, most fisheries managers haven't thought too much about these prey fish, either--until now, that is.On the West Coast, the Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet in June and consider new management options it could develop to safeguard prey species that aren't currently protected, even though they occupy a crucial position in the marine food web. The public is also starting to pay more attention. The council received more than 14,000 comments from people around the country who want stronger protections for the little fish that sustain bigger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. The council now has a chance to demonstrate its leadership to fellow fishery managers around the world.Forage fish, which also include species such as saury, smelt, and sand lance, eat tiny plants and animals drifting near the surface and turn them into protein that is consumed by everything else higher on the food web, including recreationally and commercially important big fish such as tuna, halibut and salmon.The Pacific council's consideration of this issue follows the release of new science demonstrating the vital importance of small fish to marine ecosystems. The report, issued in April by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, noted that forage fish account for 37 percent of the total global catch of wild marine fish and are mostly used to feed livestock, poultry, and farmed fish. (The Lenfest Ocean Program, established in 2004 by the Lenfest Foundation, is managed by The Pew Charitable Trusts.) The scientists noted that, in general, current management measures are not sufficient to protect these important species as demand continues to grow. They also calculated that forage fish are worth twice as much in the water as they are in a net because of the importance of the commercially valuable fish they sustain, such as salmon, albacore tuna, and cod. Moreover, this is a conservative estimate, because it does not account for the value of recreational fishing or other activities supported by forage species, such as birding or whale watching.The panel also said fishing should not begin on forage species that we know little or nothing about. Surprisingly, that common-sense approach has not caught on with fisheries management.The Pacific council has an opportunity during its June meeting to make forage fish management a priority and to promote a healthy marine food web. Protection of these species is an essential step toward sustaining a rich and productive ocean ecosystem for generations to come.

Screening audiences gasp audibly as Las Vegas runs out of water, fracking chemicals turn Texas swimming pools a nasty green and frogs change sex due to pesticide exposure.Later in Last Call, we learn how to prevent still more horrible damage to our water resources. Conservation is an obvious first step. How about being honest with ourselves about the effects of chemical contamination in our communities? And, there's the possibility that one day we'll be going toilet-to-tap for drinking water, an idea floated in the film by a deadpan, lab-coated Jack Black, holding a beta test bottle of \"Porcelain Springs.\"Doubt the seriousness of the water issue? Think it's a plot by doomy environmentalists or tax-and-spend liberals? Not according to Bush Senior's EPA Administrator, William Reilly, who warns that 117 million Americans still lack proper access to safe drinking water. And, as many as 3.5 million Americans are being sickened each year because of bacteria in poorly-treated wastewater.Reilly should know, as he served at the EPA during the beginning of the end for clean water investment. During the 1970s and the 1980s, the feds put more than $60 billion into building public wastewater treatment systems. President Ronald Reagan and Congress ended that program in 1987, abandoning true conservative values like thrift and investment in the future to help pay for tax cuts. Thus began an epic decline in conditions at our water treatment plants, which are now in such bad condition that the American Society of Civil Engineers assigned them a grade of D- in 2009.America's neglect for its infrastructure now translates into major public health problems. Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers swim and fish in the Hudson River -- even drink from it -- assuming that we're taking the necessary steps to keep the river clean. Riverkeeper's water quality testing reveals the truth: bacteria levels in the Hudson exceed federal safe swimming guidelines over 20 percent of the time. After it rains, that number can be as high as 56 percent. Roughly a quarter of New York's sewage systems are decades overdue for replacement or rehab.Granted, water treatment is only one of many problems we've let worsen in recent years, but it's only common sense to pay paramount attention to the stuff we and our families drink, cook with and bathe in. And, every year we wait, fixing the problem becomes more costly. In 1986, when the feds were still spending on water infrastructure, capital investment needs for clean water were about $80 billion. Now, they're over $250 billion.Whether you consider yourself an environmentalist or not, it's time to speak up for clean, safe water. You may not think the politicians will listen, but try it and see. Here in New York, grassroots groups won approval for key infrastructure investments in the City of Beacon, and on the Sparkill Creek in Rockland County, too. In New York City, the \"SWIM Coalition\" is driving multi-billion dollar investments in reducing storm-related sewer overflows -- investments that will not only improve conditions in local waterways, they'll also beautify city neighborhoods and save New Yorkers money in the long run.Last Call at the Oasis is an essential film that deftly balances entertainment, information and a call for action, a hallmark of its production company, Participant Media.

(PHOTOS)", "text": "From Douglas H. Chadwick:On a midsummer tundra day in Alaska, I hiked to a hillside overlooking a cascade. The waters thrummed and thundered, somersaulted and sprayed rainbow mist. Throngs of arm-length salmon leapt the opposite direction, fighting to reach spawning grounds closer to the mountains. Amid that tumult, nearly sixty grizzly bears muscled along parting the currents like boulders, plunged open-mouthed into eddies, swiped at flying fish, mock-wrestled in the shallows, and napped on the shores next to watchful bald eagles and gulls. The place was as alive as it is possible to be, and it made me feel the same way.I dropped down to the base of a rock ledge for a fresh view. Shortly after noon, a bear suddenly appeared around the corner. It was coming my direction fast-- too fast for me to do anything but press back against the stone and keep still. Closer, closer. I stopped breathing. I felt the fur of the grizzly\u2019s shoulder brush my chest, and then\u2026The animal hurried by, looking the other way. Its sole interest lay in steering clear of a huge male that had arrived at the river\u2019s edge. Though left gasping, I wasn\u2019t completely surprised to have been ignored. Here in wild sushi heaven, the bears routinely tolerated humans at close range. Sometimes, they fished side-by-side with wolves, their arch-enemies under different conditions.Later that day, one mother grizzly laid down to nurse two little cubs only ten feet from me. I know of salmon streams where females with young not only act comfortable around people but even make a point of staying near them. This is likely because they\u2019re aware that grown males, which can be dangerous to cubs, tend to keep away from the humans. Before going fishing among other adults, females have been known to drop off their cubs by viewing stations, turning the bear observers into bear babysitters. [Text continues after images.]Photos and captions courtesy of Dave Showalter and David Burke.Nineteenth century taxonomists labeled North America\u2019s grizzly/brown bears Ursus arctos horribilis. Today, Canada and the United States hold roughly 50,000 of those and 350 million Homo sapiens. During an average year, the bears kill two people. Smoking-related illnesses claim the lives of 400,000 annually in the U.S. alone, suicide takes 49,000-plus, auto collisions with deer 130, fatal maulings by dogs 32, and 22 from being crushed by a crowd. By comparison, demise by slavering bruin is not a public safety issue. It is a psychological problem.We can\u2019t seem to help monsterizing grizzlies in tales told around campfires, in sporting magazines, and on TV and movie screens. Yet these bears also happen to be among the most playful, inquisitive, and keenly intelligent life forms keeping us company on the planet. Built to learn, they keep learning over a lifespan of 30 years or more. Dr. Charles Robbins, who studies bear physiology and behavior at Washington State University, considers grizzlies smarter than dogs and perhaps as bright as young children.This isn\u2019t to say being clever makes grizzlies less formidable. Still, between our mental abilities and those of the bears, we ought to be able to figure out ways to co-exist better than we have in the past. We\u2019ve been trying for several decades now with a promising degree of success. And that, I think, is the most sensational grizzly story of all.By 1975, when grizzlies were listed as a threatened species south of Canada, they had lost 98 percent of their range and numbers there. Barely a thousand remained. The decline continued into the mid-1980\u2019s. Across the roughly 20 million-acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) with 2.2 million-acre Yellowstone National Park at the core, the population shrank to perhaps 150 or fewer. The all-important count of females with cubs fell below 20.Grizzlies survived in four other Lower 48 ecosystems: Montana\u2019s Northern Continental Divide, anchored by Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness complex; westernmost Montana\u2019s Cabinet-Yaak area; northern Idaho\u2019s Selkirk Mountains; and Washington\u2019s North Cascades. Each enclave was struggling, but the collapse in the GYE received the most attention. After all, this was America\u2019s best known big bruin country. Its grizzlies, now the southernmost left on the continent, were entirely cut off from other populations and fading fast.The GYE sprawls across 21 different mountain ranges in parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Two national parks \u2013 Yellowstone and Grand Teton \u2013 six federal forests, and various state forests, wildlife refuges, Bureau of Land Management properties, and other publicly owned lands make up two thirds of the area. Traditionally, each agency focused solely on the natural resources within its particular borders. Restoring mega-bruins whose individual home ranges sprawl across hundreds of square miles called for a whole new era of cooperation.Scientists and managers teamed up to do a better job of defining critical bear habitat and limiting development within it. Where many a bear had been terminated for causing problems with livestock pastured on public lands, the grazing leases were relocated. Officials worked harder to control other attractants as well, fencing off garbage dumps in rural communities, replacing standard trash bins with bear-proof versions, and installing hanging poles to keep supplies up out of paw\u2019s reach at backcountry campsites.Carnivores by anatomy, grizzlies are highly adaptable omnivores in practice. They sniff opportunity in anything from the celery sticks in a tourist\u2019s cooler to the flavored lip balm in a hiker\u2019s pack; and from the freshly skinned elk a hunter holds overnight in the woods to the fruit trees, horse pellets, dog chow, or seeds in a birdfeeder at a country home.Where rewarded with food, the bears make a habit of returning. They quickly grasp the connection. The problem, as every bear manager knows, is that too many people don\u2019t. They keep leaving out open invitations to big, hairy company. Somebody might end up killed-- and 99.9 percent of the time, it\u2019s the grizzly. Progress in driving home the message that \u201ca fed bear is a dead bear\u201d was slow. Nevertheless, as the agencies and non-profit conservation groups expanded public bear awareness programs, that effort, too, began to make a difference.The current count of grizzlies in the GYE is at least 500, possibly 600. It has been rising 4 to 7 percent annually, and the number of females with cubs has held above 50 for the past six years. As for the total population south of Canada, experts say it has reached 1,500 or more.The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which oversees imperiled species, chose to define the grizzlies of the five Lower 48 ecosystems as distinct population segments and deal with each separately. In 2007, the agency declared the GYE segment recovered. No sooner was it removed from the Endangered Species List than environmental groups sued, calling the de-listing premature. A federal court agreed and in 2009 reinstated the bears\u2019 threatened status. But the wildlife service challenged the court\u2019s decision, leaving that population in a sort of legal limbo.Although some of the threats GYE grizzlies face have been reduced, none has gone away; not proposals to develop the backcountry; not livestock conflicts; not sportsmen shooting a grizzly in self-defense or because they thought it was a legally hunted black bear; not poaching out of sheer malice; not increasing off-road vehicle use; not expanding subdivision of open lands for new homes; and not unsecured food and garbage luring bears into trouble.One special concern remains the GYE bears\u2019 genetic diversity \u2013 the lowest among Lower 48 grizzlies. For an isolated population, the effects of inbreeding can become more problematic with every generation. A second major worry is that GYE grizzlies depend more heavily on white bark pine seeds (raided from squirrel caches during autumn) for nourishment than any other group. Suffused with fats and oils, the seeds provide as much as half the protein in Yellowstone area grizzlies\u2019 diet.Heavier-than-usual white bark seed production is reflected in bigger grizzly litter sizes, increased survival of young, and shorter times between pregnancies. And since this pine favors high altitudes, which are typically remote settings, bears feeding there seldom come into contact with people. Poor crops are linked to the opposite results-- lower reproduction and a greater potential for conflict as the bears roam lower elevations with more human activity. At the moment, 95% of Yellowstone\u2019s once-abundant white bark stands are under assault from a European fungus and native mountain pine beetles.Warmer average winter temperatures have allowed the beetles to multiply at an abnormally fast pace and overwinter farther upslope. Not only did the federal court cite the impact of global warming as a substantial threat to Yellowstone\u2019s grizzlies, white bark pine has itself become a candidate for listing as an imperiled species.Organizations such as the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a leading force for conservation in the region, refer to the grizzly as an indicator species. It means that where a landscape is big and bountiful enough to harbor great bears, the full array of other creatures belonging to that part of the world is likely to be present and in good condition. A prime example can be found on the Absaroka-Beartooth Front, a mix of snowy crags, forested slopes, and sagebrush foothills that sweeps down from the high eastern boundary of Yellowstone Park toward the Great Plains. The best bear habitat in the GYE lies mostly outside the national parks, and the Front hosts some of the highest grizzly densities of all amid tremendous elk herds, mule deer, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, wolverines, black bears, bobcats, moose, mountain lions, mountain goats, wolves, nesting golden eagles, and prairie falcons outracing the wind.Because they play an oversized role in shaping the ecosystems they inhabit, grizzlies are also referred to as a keystone species. They affect prey populations directly through hunting, scavenge large carcasses in between, and redistribute tons of nutrients. Gobbling tens of thousands of berries daily in late summer and fall, they disperse the seeds from valley bottoms to subalpine slopes. They are also the chief earthmovers in many habitats, putting those long claws to work tilling the soil in search of roots and bulbs, renewing plant communities in the process.A third term often applied to grizzlies is umbrella species, since guarding their critical habitat adds a layer of security for all their wild neighbors. Backpackers, mountaineers, fishermen, naturalists, tourists \u2013 all the people drawn to truly untamed settings and rich wild communities \u2013 find their values defended as well.At the same time, there\u2019s no shortage of political and economic pressures to de-list grizzlies so restrictions on industrial activities can be lifted or at least eased. The Shoshone National Forest, which oversees much of the Front, has been fielding proposals to open pristine public lands to mineral development for years. Recently, a push to extract oil and gas has been gaining momentum.Is it possible to somehow produce more fossil fuel and more grizzlies at the same time? Maybe in a more perfect world. You won\u2019t find win-win models father north along the Rocky Mountain Front in Alberta, where an invasion of new roads, drill rigs, pumps, and pipelines has cost wildlife dearly. Not long ago, the grizzlies of that vast province numbered in the many thousands. Today, fewer are found there than in the GYE. So much for importing grizzlies from Canada if we lose those in the contiguous states.I\u2019ve met folks in the Rockies who feel it\u2019s high time we did lose some grizzlies. In years without any serious bear problems, news outlets don\u2019t run stories on the order of \u201cHundreds of Thousands Stroll through Wild Grizzly Bear Households Unscratched!\u201d I wish they would, because sooner or later there comes an interval with tragic conflicts and all kinds of media coverage. Lethal attacks on a hiker and, separately, a camper in GYE national forests took place during the summer of 2010. Summer of 2011 brought two cases of a hiker in Yellowstone Park killed by grizzly bears. That fall, a hunter near the Idaho/Montana border shot a grizzly he thought was a black bear, and when the wounded animal attacked, the man\u2019s hunting partner fatally shot him while aiming for the bear.Several mauling injuries involving elk hunters, hikers, and campers also occurred in the GYE and Montana over the same period. People interpreting all this as the start of a deadly trend began lobbying to end grizzly protection, warning that recovery efforts have gone too far. A number of guides, outfitters and sportsmen eager for trophy grizzly hunting to get underway again have been making the same argument.How many grizzly bears are enough? If they keep expanding their range and numbers, society will have to weigh that question carefully. At the moment, however, all 1,500 to 1,600 in the lower 48 states could be lined up in a Wal-Mart parking lot with plenty of room left over. The 500 to 600 from the GYE would fit inside the store; not peacefully, mind you, but I\u2019m trying to make the point that grizzlies are not exactly overrunning the mountain West. Three of the five grizzly bear ecosystems south of Canada contain fewer than 40 animals each.If you wish to live a long, safe life here, these are my recommendations: Exercise more, cut down on fatty foods, and lobby for stricter drunk driving laws. I don\u2019t want to make light of anyone\u2019s fears, only to stay realistic about the levels of harm we face.As for practical advice to prevent an actual mauling, first, don\u2019t feed these animals \u2013 ever, not on purpose or by inadvertently leaving out attractants. Second, carry bear spray on outings; none of the victims I mentioned did. Contrary to what a lot of tough-guy outdoorsmen believe, those little cannisters of red pepper-infused oil are far more effective than guns in deterring aggression. Studies have shown the spray\u2019s success rate to be nearly 100 percent. Give yourself a snootful, as I once did by mistake, and you\u2019ll understand why.Bears force us to think hard about what we really mean when we say we want to preserve nature. A sample here and there? Multitudes of certain majestic creatures but only token numbers of others \u2013 just enough to let us say we didn\u2019t drive them completely extinct? The decision to try to include healthy populations of North America\u2019s largest, most powerful land-based predator in our future signaled an historical turnaround in attitude for most of society. What will it take to see this remarkable effort through?Re-connecting Yellowstone\u2019s bears to the other four Lower 48 grizzly bear ecosystems via bridges, or corridors, of wildlands would boost the chances of survival for all those groups over the long run. They need the freedom to roam \u2013 to migrate, disperse, probe new landscapes, and meet up with others of their kind \u2013 on a regional scale. Without it, maintaining healthy gene pools, adjusting to a changing climate, and coping with periodic stresses such as drought, wildfires, disease epidemics, infestations, and invasions by non-native species through the centuries is all but impossible. As ever, the umbrella species concept comes into play, for modern conservation biology tells us that the best hope of sustaining other creatures in the same ecosystems involves both taking care of the strongholds and linking them together into a vibrant network.Grizzlies energize some of the grandest landscapes in North America. And all the while, these bears expand our awareness of nature, redefine our relationship with it, encourage us to tie together fragmented ecosystems, and thereby restore wholeness to the living world. How much of this is enough? I don\u2019t know, but \u201cless\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like the right answer.About Douglas H. Chadwick: A wildlife biologist who studied mountain goats and grizzlies in the Rockies, elephants in Africa and whales in the world\u2019s oceans, Doug Chadwick began writing about natural history and conservation for national magazines. On assignments from Siberia to the Congo River\u2019s headwaters, he has produced several hundred popular articles and eleven books. He is also the vice chair of the board of Vital Ground, a nonprofit land trust that has helped safeguard more than 600,000 acres of wildlife habitat in Alaska, Canada, and the western US. He lives with his wife Karen Reeves in Whitefish, Montana.About the Greater Yellowstone Coalition: The Greater Yellowstone Coalition (GYC) was founded in 1983 on a simple premise: An ecosystem will remain healthy and wild only if it is kept whole. Since that time, they have emerged as a nationally known advocate for the idea that ecosystem level sustainability and science should guide the management of the region\u2019s public and private lands.GYC been a pioneer in defining and promoting the concept of ecosystem management for more than 28 years. Their offices, strategically placed in Bozeman, Mont.; Jackson and Cody, Wyo.; and Idaho Falls, Idaho, allow them to engage in a wide variety of efforts locally, regionally, and nationally to ensure the area's forests, streams, wildlife and other features are protected for generations to come. Find out what they are doing today to protect the lands, waters, and wildlife the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and how you can help play a part in maintaining its future.About the Absaroka Front Tripods in the Mud (TIM): iLCP Associate Fellow, Dave Showalter has been working with the Greater Yellowstone Coalition to inspire public support for preserving the Absarako-Beartooth (A-B) Front in Wyoming as an intact ecosystem as the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service each revise their twenty-year master plans with regards to mineral leasing in the A-B Front."}, {"title": "If China Has a John Stossel, Be Afraid, Very Afraid", "text": "I'm sure almost every country has someone like John Stossel -- a self-righteous media personality who depicts the world in black and white, and whose appeal, to a section of the population, lies precisely in his oversimplified take on what are very complex matters. I'm usually able to keep such media at bay, but the title to Stossel's recent editorial, \"Keeping Nature Exactly As Is... Forever\" in Reason Magazine was too hard to pass up.Let's start from the end of Stossel's piece:\"Most of us don't think civilization is evil, but we worry about what environmentalists say. We don't have the time to do complicated calculations about economic trade-offs. It's easier to just recycle something, buy a Prius and donate to the Environmental Defense Fund. Today, we put up with amazing intrusions in the name of environmentalism. A million petty regulations mandate surtaxes on gas, separation of garbage into multiple bins, special light bulbs, taxes on plastic bags and so on. Yet these things are of so little ecological consequence that the Earth will never notice. For this, we must surrender our freedom?\"And there it is: environmental protection versus freedom. That's about as black and white as it gets. Don't concern yourself with the facts that if everyone did separate their trash or use energy-saving bulbs, we could save billions of dollars not digging new landfills and not building new power plants. The U.S. government's Energy Star program saved Americans $16 billion in utility bills in 2007 alone. Not bad for a \"petty regulation.\"If Stossel were persuaded by facts, he might see the collective savings such individual actions have. I know he is all about saving money because that's why he's against so-called \"green schemes\":\"The green schemes make energy cost more. Of course, some who push 'green jobs' want the price of energy to rise. Then we will live in smaller homes, drive less and burn fewer fossil fuels. But if the environmental lobby wants Americans to be poorer, it ought to come clean about that.\"Gotta love his ability to boil it down for us, i.e., striving for conservation and efficiency means you're poor. Let's apply his logical reasoning to another issue near and dear to his heart, social welfare reform. According to Stossel, individual actions don't matter in light of the billions of tons of carbon and waste that must be dealt with to solve the problem. So why should any American care if one of their fellow citizens doesn't have a job and relies on welfare? They're just one person getting a few thousand dollars in taxpayer money. How is eliminating their welfare check going to solve America's $15 trillion debt problem?Stossel gets at least one thing right. Green energy and green jobs do not come cheap. Indeed, achieving a truly sustainable economy would require fundamental changes to the dominant notion of free-market capitalism for both those on the left and the right. But what Stossel fails to appreciate is that the cost of ignoring our responsibilities to future generations could very likely result in a less prosperous and more dangerous world. Indeed, he fails to understand that economic actions have externalities, and that the \"tragedy of the commons\" even exists.Perhaps it is Stossel's American-centric view that permits his misunderstanding. America's geography blesses it with abundant natural resources and a relatively small population. But China lacks such advantages.China's ecological limitations -- water shortages, severely polluted water, soil pollution and the collapse of costal fisheries to name a few -- don't allow it the luxury of entertaining rhetoric like Stossel's. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese die annually from deaths related to their nation's water crisis. Air pollution in its cities, from coal plants and individually driven cars, make American visitors cringe when they first arrive. Many of these Americans forget that without regulation in the U.S., their cities would look the same. Laudably, China has recently raised the price of gasoline and electricity to levels that are, on average, higher than those in the U.S. and began to ban incandescent light bulbs. Did the country that raised more people out of poverty than any other in history do this to make its people poor again? Probably not. Rather, it was because its growing demand for fossil fuels is making all fuels more expensive, and hopefully to encourage efficiency.If Stossel thinks that environmentalists are making U.S. energy prices rise, his understanding of markets and world events is skewed beyond belief. I invite him to come to China, so that he might understand why global energy prices are rising. China will struggle with leaving a dirty economic model behind because it is always easier to preference short-term economic growth over investments in value creating conservation for the future. But at least China realizes there are real physical constraints to its landfills and to its fossil fueled growth. If it doesn't realize this, then American environmentalists should be the least of Stossel's concerns."}, {"title": "Epistle to the Ecotopians", "text": "[This document was found on the computer of Ecotopia author Ernest Callenbach (1929-2012) after his death.]Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comTo all brothers and sisters who hold the dream in their hearts of a future world in which humans and all other beings live in harmony and mutual support -- a world of sustainability, stability, and confidence. A world something like the one I described, so long ago, in Ecotopia and Ecotopia Emerging.As I survey my life, which is coming near its end, I want to set down a few thoughts that might be useful to those coming after. It will soon be time for me to give back to Gaia the nutrients that I have used during a long, busy, and happy life. I am not bitter or resentful at the approaching end; I have been one of the extraordinarily lucky ones. So it behooves me here to gather together some thoughts and attitudes that may prove useful in the dark times we are facing: a century or more of exceedingly difficult times.How will those who survive manage it? What can we teach our friends, our children, our communities? Although we may not be capable of changing history, how can we equip ourselves to survive it?I contemplate these questions in the full consciousness of my own mortality. Being offered an actual number of likely months to live, even though the estimate is uncertain, mightily focuses the mind. On personal things, of course, on loved ones and even loved things, but also on the Big Picture.But let us begin with last things first, for a change. The analysis will come later, for those who wish it.Hope. Children exude hope, even under the most terrible conditions, and that must inspire us as our conditions get worse. Hopeful patients recover better. Hopeful test candidates score better. Hopeful builders construct better buildings. Hopeful parents produce secure and resilient children. In groups, an atmosphere of hope is essential to shared successful effort: \u201cYes, we can!\u201d is not an empty slogan, but a mantra for people who intend to do something together -- whether it is rescuing victims of hurricanes, rebuilding flood-damaged buildings on higher ground, helping wounded people through first aid, or inventing new social structures (perhaps one in which only people are \u201cpersons,\u201d not corporations). We cannot know what threats we will face. But ingenuity against adversity is one of our species\u2019 built-in resources. We cope, and faith in our coping capacity is perhaps our biggest resource of all.Mutual support. The people who do best at basic survival tasks (we know this experimentally, as well as intuitively) are cooperative, good at teamwork, often altruistic, mindful of the common good. In drastic emergencies like hurricanes or earthquakes, people surprise us by their sacrifices -- of food, of shelter, even sometimes of life itself. Those who survive social or economic collapse, or wars, or pandemics, or starvation, will be those who manage scarce resources fairly; hoarders and dominators win only in the short run, and end up dead, exiled, or friendless. So, in every way we can we need to help each other, and our children, learn to be cooperative rather than competitive; to be helpful rather than hurtful; to look out for the communities of which we are a part, and on which we ultimately depend.Practical skills. With the movement into cities of the U.S. population, and much of the rest of the world\u2019s people, we have had a massive de-skilling in how to do practical tasks. When I was a boy in the country, all of us knew how to build a tree house, or construct a small hut, or raise chickens, or grow beans, or screw pipes together to deliver water. It was a sexist world, of course, so when some of my chums in eighth grade said we wanted to learn girls\u2019 \u201chome ec\u201d skills like making bread or boiling eggs, the teachers were shocked, but we got to do it. There was widespread competence in fixing things -- impossible with most modern contrivances, of course, but still reasonable for the basic tools of survival: pots and pans, bicycles, quilts, tents, storage boxes.We all need to learn, or relearn, how we would keep the rudiments of life going if there were no paid specialists around, or means to pay them. Every child should learn elementary carpentry, from layout and sawing to driving nails. Everybody should know how to chop wood safely, and build a fire. Everybody should know what to do if dangers appear from fire, flood, electric wires down, and the like. Taking care of each other is one practical step at a time, most of them requiring help from at least one other person; survival is a team sport.Organize. Much of the American ideology, our shared and usually unspoken assumptions, is hyper-individualistic. We like to imagine that heroes are solitary, have super powers, and glory in violence, and that if our work lives and business lives seem tamer, underneath they are still struggles red in blood and claw. We have sought solitude on the prairies, as cowboys on the range, in our dependence on media (rather than real people), and even in our cars, armored cabins of solitude. We have an uneasy and doubting attitude about government, as if we all reserve the right to be outlaws. But of course human society, like ecological webs, is a complex dance of mutual support and restraint, and if we are lucky it operates by laws openly arrived at and approved by the populace.If the teetering structure of corporate domination, with its monetary control of Congress and our other institutions, should collapse of its own greed, and the government be unable to rescue it, we will have to reorganize a government that suits the people. We will have to know how to organize groups, how to compromise with other groups, how to argue in public for our positions. It turns out that \u201cbrainstorming,\u201d a totally noncritical process in which people just throw out ideas wildly, doesn\u2019t produce workable ideas. In particular, it doesn\u2019t work as well as groups in which ideas are proposed, critiqued, improved, debated. But like any group process, this must be protected from domination by powerful people and also over-talkative people. When the group recognizes its group power, it can limit these distortions. Thinking together is enormously creative; it has huge survival value.Learn to live with contradictions. These are dark times, these are bright times. We are implacably making the planet less habitable. Every time a new oil field is discovered, the press cheers: \u201cHooray, there is more fuel for the self-destroying machines!\u201d We are turning more land into deserts and parking lots. We are wiping out innumerable species that are not only wondrous and beautiful, but might be useful to us. We are multiplying to the point where our needs and our wastes outweigh the capacities of the biosphere to produce and absorb them. And yet, despite the bloody headlines and the rocketing military budgets, we are also, unbelievably, killing fewer of each other proportionately than in earlier centuries. We have mobilized enormous global intelligence and mutual curiosity, through the Internet and outside it. We have even evolved, spottily, a global understanding that democracy is better than tyranny, that love and tolerance are better than hate, that hope is better than rage and despair, that we are prone, especially in catastrophes, to be astonishingly helpful and cooperative.We may even have begun to share an understanding that while the dark times may continue for generations, in time new growth and regeneration will begin. In the biological process called \u201csuccession,\u201d a desolate, disturbed area is gradually, by a predictable sequence of returning plants, restored to ecological continuity and durability. When old institutions and habits break down or consume themselves, new experimental shoots begin to appear, and people explore and test and share new and better ways to survive together.It is never easy or simple. But already we see, under the crumbling surface of the conventional world, promising developments: new ways of organizing economic activity (cooperatives, worker-owned companies, nonprofits, trusts), new ways of using low-impact technology to capture solar energy, to sequester carbon dioxide, new ways of building compact, congenial cities that are low (or even self-sufficient) in energy use, low in waste production, high in recycling of almost everything. A vision of sustainability that sometimes shockingly resembles Ecotopia is tremulously coming into existence at the hands of people who never heard of the book.___________________Now in principle, the Big Picture seems simple enough, though devilishly complex in the details. We live in the declining years of what is still the biggest economy in the world, where a looter elite has fastened itself upon the decaying carcass of the empire. It is intent on speedily and relentlessly extracting the maximum wealth from that carcass, impoverishing our former working middle class. But this maggot class does not invest its profits here. By law and by stock-market pressures, corporations must seek their highest possible profits, no matter the social or national consequences -- which means moving capital and resources abroad, wherever profit potential is larger. As Karl Marx darkly remarked, \u201cCapital has no country,\u201d and in the conditions of globalization his meaning has come clear.The looter elite systematically exports jobs, skills, knowledge, technology, retaining at home chiefly financial manipulation expertise: highly profitable, but not of actual productive value. Through \u201cproductivity gains\u201d and speedups, it extracts maximum profit from domestic employees; then, firing the surplus, it claims surprise that the great mass of people lack purchasing power to buy up what the economy can still produce (or import).Here again Marx had a telling phrase: \u201cCrisis of under-consumption.\u201d When you maximize unemployment and depress wages, people have to cut back. When they cut back, businesses they formerly supported have to shrink or fail, adding their own employees to the ranks of the jobless, and depressing wages still further. End result: something like Mexico, where a small, filthy rich plutocracy rules over an impoverished mass of desperate, uneducated, and hopeless people.Barring unprecedented revolutionary pressures, this is the actual future we face in the United States, too. As we know from history, such societies can stand a long time, supported by police and military control, manipulation of media, surveillance and dirty tricks of all kinds. It seems likely that a few parts of the world (Germany, with its worker-council variant of capitalism, New Zealand with its relative equality, Japan with its social solidarity, and some others) will remain fairly democratic.The U.S., which has a long history of violent plutocratic rule unknown to the textbook-fed, will stand out as the best-armed Third World country, its population ill-fed, ill-housed, ill-educated, ill-cared for in health, and increasingly poverty-stricken: even Social Security may be whittled down, impoverishing tens of millions of the elderly.As empires decline, their leaders become increasingly incompetent -- petulant, ignorant, gifted only with PR skills of posturing and spinning, and prone to the appointment of loyal idiots to important government positions. Comedy thrives; indeed writers are hardly needed to invent outrageous events.We live, then, in a dark time here on our tiny precious planet. Ecological devastation, political and economic collapse, irreconcilable ideological and religious conflict, poverty, famine: the end of the overshoot of cheap-oil-based consumer capitalist expansionism.If you don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been, you have small chance of understanding where you might be headed. So let me offer a capsule history for those who, like most of us, got little help from textbook history.At 82, my life has included a surprisingly substantial slice of American history. In the century or so up until my boyhood in Appalachian central Pennsylvania, the vast majority of Americans subsisted as farmers on the land. Most, like people elsewhere in the world, were poor, barely literate, ill-informed, short-lived. Millions had been slaves. Meanwhile in the cities, vast immigrant armies were mobilized by ruthless and often violent \u201crobber baron\u201d capitalists to build vast industries that made things: steel, railroads, ships, cars, skyscrapers.Then, when I was in grade school, came World War II. America built the greatest armaments industry the world had ever seen, and when the war ended with most other industrial countries in ruins, we had a run of unprecedented productivity and prosperity. Thanks to strong unions and a sympathetic government, this prosperity was widely shared: a huge working middle class evolved -- tens of millions of people could afford (on one wage) a modest house, a car, perhaps sending a child to college. This era peaked around 1973, when wages stagnated, the Vietnam War took a terrible toll in blood and money, and the country began sliding rightward.In the next epoch, which we are still in and which may be our last as a great nation, capitalists who grew rich and powerful by making things gave way to a new breed: financiers who grasped that you could make even more money by manipulating money. (And by persuading Congress to subsidize them -- the system should have been called Subsidism, not Capitalism.) They had no concern for the productivity of the nation or the welfare of its people; with religious fervor, they believed in maximizing profit as the absolute economic goal. They recognized that, by capturing the government through the election finance system and removing government regulation, they could turn the financial system into a giant casino.Little by little, they hollowed the country out, until it was helplessly dependent on other nations for almost all its necessities. We had to import significant steel components from China or Japan. We came to pay for our oil imports by exporting food (i.e., our soil). Our media and our educational system withered. Our wars became chronic and endless and stupefyingly expensive. Our diets became suicidal, and our medical system faltered; life expectancies began to fall.And so we have returned, in a sort of terrible circle, to something like my boyhood years, when President Roosevelt spoke in anger of \u201cone third of a nation ill-housed, ill-fed, ill-clothed.\u201d A large and militant contingent of white, mostly elderly, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant right wingers, mortally threatened by their impending minority status and pretending to be liberty-lovers, desperately seek to return us still further back.Americans like to think of ours as an exceptional country, immune through geographical isolation and some kind of special virtue to the tides of history. Through the distorted lens of our corporate media, we possess only a distorted view of what the country is really like now. In the next decades, we shall see whether we indeed possess the intelligence, the strength, and the mutual courage to break through to another positive era.No futurist can foresee the possibilities. As empires decay, their civilian leaderships become increasingly crazed, corrupt, and incompetent, and often the military (which is after all a parasite of the whole nation, and has no independent financial base like the looter class) takes over. Another possible scenario is that if the theocratic red center of the country prevails in Washington, the relatively progressive and prosperous coastal areas will secede in self-defense.Ecotopia is a novel, and secession was its dominant metaphor: how would a relatively rational part of the country save itself ecologically if it was on its own? As Ecotopia Emerging puts it, Ecotopia aspired to be a beacon for the rest of the world. And so it may prove, in the very, very long run, because the general outlines of Ecotopia are those of any possible future sustainable society.The \"ecology in one country\" argument was an echo of an actual early Soviet argument, as to whether \"socialism in one country\" was possible. In both cases, it now seems to me, the answer must be no. We are now fatally interconnected, in climate change, ocean impoverishment, agricultural soil loss, etc., etc., etc. International consumer capitalism is a self-destroying machine, and as long as it remains the dominant social form, we are headed for catastrophe; indeed, like rafters first entering the \"tongue\" of a great rapid, we are already embarked on it.When disasters strike and institutions falter, as at the end of empires, it does not mean that the buildings all fall down and everybody dies. Life goes on, and in particular, the remaining people fashion new institutions that they hope will better ensure their survival.So I look to a long-term process of \"succession,\" as the biological concept has it, where \"disturbances\" kill off an ecosystem, but little by little new plants colonize the devastated area, prepare the soil for larger and more complex plants (and the other beings who depend on them), and finally the process achieves a flourishing, resilient, complex state -- not necessarily what was there before, but durable and richly productive. In a similar way, experiments under way now, all over the world, are exploring how sustainability can in fact be achieved locally. Technically, socially, economically -- since it is quite true, as ecologists know, that everything is connected to everything else, and you can never just do one thing by itself.Since I wrote Ecotopia, I have become less confident of humans' political ability to act on commonsense, shared values. Our era has become one of spectacular polarization, with folly multiplying on every hand. That is the way empires crumble: they are taken over by looter elites, who sooner or later cause collapse. But then new games become possible, and with luck Ecotopia might be among them.Humans tend to try to manage things: land, structures, even rivers. We spend enormous amounts of time, energy, and treasure in imposing our will on nature, on preexisting or inherited structures, dreaming of permanent solutions, monuments to our ambitions and dreams. But in periods of slack, decline, or collapse, our abilities no longer suffice for all this management. We have to let things go.All things \u201cgo\u201d somewhere: they evolve, with or without us, into new forms. So as the decades pass, we should try not always to futilely fight these transformations. As the Japanese know, there is much unnoticed beauty in wabi-sabi -- the old, the worn, the tumble-down, those things beginning their transformation into something else. We can embrace this process of devolution: embellish it when strength avails, learn to love it.There is beauty in weathered and unpainted wood, in orchards overgrown, even in abandoned cars being incorporated into the earth. Let us learn, like the Forest Service sometimes does, to put unwise or unneeded roads \u201cto bed,\u201d help a little in the healing of the natural contours, the re-vegetation by native plants. Let us embrace decay, for it is the source of all new life and growth.Ernest Callenbach, author of the classic environmental novel Ecotopia among other works, founded and edited the internationally known journal Film Quarterly.

The goal, like Skin Deep, isn\u2019t to scare the pants off of people (although this can be a side effect) but to help (sometimes oblivious) consumers make healthier and more environmentally conscious purchasing decisions. I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time on Skin Deep in the past and it\u2019s an excellent, eye-opening resource.Anyways, as a sort of unsettling tease before the EWG Cleaners Database is officially published, EWG has released the Cleaners Hall of Shame. Basically, it\u2019s a \u201cworst of\u201d list that spotlights the ickiest products to appear in the forthcoming cleaners database.The inductees of the Cleaners Hall of Shame are divided into several categories such as \u201cHigh-Hazard Ingredients,\u201d \u201cFatal if Inhaled\u201d and \u201cMystery Mixtures.\u201d While the usual suspects are represented (oven and toilet cleaners, drain openers, air fresheners, etc.) there are some surprises on the list, particularly in the first category titled \u201cGreenwashing.\u201d Three products appear in this area: Citra-Solv Cleaner and Degreaser, Simple Green Concentrated All-Purpose Cleaner, and Whink Rust Stain Remover. The first product contains d-limonene, a citrus oil-derived solvent that can seriously compromise indoor air quality when combined with trace levels of ozone air pollution; the second product contains 2-butoxyethanol, a red blood cell-damaging, eye-irritating solvent; the third product warns: \u201cmay be fatal or cause permanent damage\u201d and \"causes severe burns which may not be immediately painful or visible.\" The moral of the story? EWG explains that \u201ccleaners labeled \u2018safe,\u2019 \u2018non-toxic\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019 can contain hazardous ingredients. There should be a law against bogus claims, but there isn't.\u201dAnother alarming category in the Cleaners Hall of Shame is \u201cBanned Abroad\u201d where somewhat ubiquitous products with key ingredients that have gotten them banned outside of the U.S. (in the EU, specifically) are spotlighted. They include Mop & Glo Multi-Surface Floor Cleaner (methoxydiglycol), Scrubbing Bubbles \u2013 Antibacterial Bathroom Cleaner and Extend-A-Clean Mega Shower Foamer (butoxydiglycol), Spic & Span Multi-Surface Floor Cleaner (nonylphenol ethoxylate), and others. And this is wild/wildly disturbing: Comet Cleanser Powder was found to emit more than 146 hazardous chemicals, most of them \u2014 formaldehyde, benzene, chloroform, and toluene included \u2014 are not listed on the product labeling.Click here to check out the Cleaners Hall of Shame in its entirety.

They aren't outright dangerous.

In Chicago, 12 million pounds of soil was dumped on the city.It marked the peak of the American Dust Bowl, a nine-year period that destroyed farmlands, blackened skies and left millions homeless.The Dust Bowl resulted from years of unsustainable agriculture that eroded soils and destroyed native grasslands that held the earth in place. The region had been plowed from 1914 and 1920 to meet demand for wheat generated by World War I. When droughts hit, topsoil dried up and blew away.The devastation was a wake-up call to lawmakers who began taking action to save the nation's agriculture industry and usher in a new era of land preservation. Congress created a new agency - -now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service -- to address land erosion and provide financial incentives for farmers to take lands unsuited for agriculture out of crop production, and turn them into permanent pastures or forests.Many of the same initiatives continue today as part of the U.S. Farm Bill, which provides the single largest source of federal funding for conservation. Congress is now debating the bill's reauthorization, and funding for it could be decided this year.While other droughts have hit the Great Plains over the past 70 years -- some worse than the one that launched the Dust Bowl -- the nation has been spared the devastation that occurred in the 1930s.Tom Christensen, regional conservationist for the Natural Resource Conservation Service, reports that \"the conservation measures and practices put in place as a result of the Dust Bowl have helped prevent similar catastrophic events.\"The lessons learned from the Dust Bowl are as important today as they were in the 1930s. As the world's population continues to grow, so does the demand for food and fiber. For example, we expect that food production will need to double by 2050 to keep up with these demands.If we are to meet those demands -- without creating another natural disaster -- it is critical to keep our lands and waters healthy and productive. Conservation cannot be viewed as an afterthought or a luxury. It is an essential tool to ensure the long term productivity of agriculture and forestry, and to sustain the economic viability of rural families and communities.We should be proud that our nation has been able to avoid another Dust Bowl thanks to well-designed conservation programs that assist farmers to retire unproductive lands, protect the soils and water sources farmers rely upon for their livelihoods, and preserve natural habitat in rural landscapes.The results of these conservation activities have multiple benefits for every region of America. Not only have we been able to feed growing populations, but we've also protected rural economies. Farming and farm-related employment supports about 24 million jobs across the United States.Hunting, angling and wildlife-dependent recreation contribute $122 billion annually to our national economy. Natural resources-based products represent a significant proportion of the export sector so essential to our economic health: \"Indeed, U.S. agricultural exports exceeded $137 billion and accounted for a $42 billion farm trade surplus in 2011, one of the bright spots in the American economy last year.\"Seventy years ago, the Dust Bowl taught our nation the importance of conservation. We learned a very important lesson. Our economies, our security and our livelihoods continue to depend on healthy lands and waters.Click here to read more about the Dust Bowl and the conservation policies it sparked, and see a slide show of the impact it had across the country."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Ripe Delights", "text": "For Jonathan Lovekin, ripe is \"the jewel-like color and light reflecting off a golden caramelized quince. For Paulette Phlipot, it's \"the teensy little hairs on a raspberry.\"Lovekin and Phlipot, both food photographers, celebrate the physical beauty of produce in their new books -- different books that share the same title: Ripe.The books owe much to the produce-centric essays and recipes by their authors. Lovekin photographed Ripe: A Cook in the Orchard by beloved English cook and writer Nigel Slater. Phlipot came up with the idea of arranging produce tonally -- by color -- with Ripe: A Fresh, Colorful and Approach to Fruits and Vegetables, written by food blogger extraordinaire and IACP winner Cheryl Sternman Rule. In both cases, though, the images will make you want to bite the pages.Lovekin approaches produce as \"quite classical, a still life.\" He's provided the gorgeous images for Slater's books and articles as well as the sexy veggie photography for Plenty by Yotam Ottolenghi.Both Slater  and Ottolenghi show fruits and vegetables a good time. Both \"style and think about how they want their food presented, they've kind of resolved that bit. I find the framing and light,\" says Lovekin, speaking from his studio in London. \"With Nigel, I tend to be softer and quieter. Yotam's food is very different, it's sharper and brighter.\"Though Lovekin effortlessly turns eggplant into object d'art, he's less into cooking and eating. \"I like the idea of Wittgenstein -- he had the same thing every night,\" he says.\"I grew up in the '60s and '70s in England. Food wasn't a force. We didn't have a family where we would all sit down at a meal, where a meal was important. That's why I love the idea of food as a communal, cultural thing,\" says Lovekin. \"I'm always searching for community. But I like being on the outside of it, looking in.\"Phlipot, on the other hand, approaches food from \"the inside. I look at it as a living object. It won't look the same tomorrow or in three or four hours. With produce, I feel the living aspect of it. You think it's a still life because it doesn't run away, but it's changing.\"Lovekin is London-chic. Phlipot is \"small town Idaho.\" She, too, does a lot of work with chefs, but prefers photographing -- and eating -- fruit and vegetables in their \"organic, clean, simple, quiet\" state. \"When I work with produce, cutting it up for dinner, I notice details I would normally overlook when first picking it up at the market. I enjoy translating that excitement and elevating the produce to a new, different level in order to get people to stop and ponder and hopefully be motivated by the images.\" The radishes in Ripe come straight from her garden.\"Nigel brought me out into the garden,\" says Lovekin. \"I would have always taken them inside and treated them more as objects.\"Unlike Lovekin, Phlipot's parents loved to cook and eat and took delight in introducing their children to all kinds of food. They made it \"an adventure.\" A dedicated vegetarian, Phlipot's sharing that sense of adventure with her 17 month-old daughter Cassidy. \"We're having so much fun with it. She's wanting to try what we're eating -- even a spicy curry, she'll try it and likes it.\"Even Lovekin, an indifferent eater, appreciates produce for its sheer design value -- its color, texture, shape. \"Something green with luscious gradations of color is easier to photograph. Meat is quite difficult. It's brown blobs.\"Lovekin and Phlipot's approaches may differ but their lenses agree -- fruits and vegetables are exciting, alluring, ravishing.

I grant you this: it's no easy task.But having just returned from informal meetings in New York where civil servants were negotiating -- on your behalf -- text to be adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in less than two months' time, I must wonder if you're up to the task this time around.Anyone who's ever written a document by committee -- and suffered the disappointment of a final result which is bland and lifeless -- can understand your challenge in producing a plan of action out of a process involving hundreds of people operating by consensus. But this is precisely what we expect of you.So far, however, it's not looking too good. The document currently stands at 128 pages, rife with bracketed text, which in negotiating terms means \"not yet agreed\" (and which really means, \"I'm not giving up on this position until I extract some blood from you in return\"). And I'm not just talking about the hard stuff; you're all jockeying for position even in the simplest statements.Take the Preambular text, for example, which refers to the need to eradicate poverty. The US only wants to eradicate \"extreme\" poverty, whereas developing countries not surprisingly want to delete that qualification. One can only assume this is part of a more general negotiating stance (pervasive throughout the text, and in other negotiations for that matter) in which the US wants to do away with the distinctions made at the first Rio Earth Summit 20 years ago between rich and poor countries.President Obama, we get that you're concerned about the US losing its competitive advantage in relation to new powerhouses such as China, Brazil and India, but how can you look us in the eye and say that any level of poverty is okay? And what are your negotiators thinking when they propose deleting the word \"clean\" from the sentence \"we reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation\"?I don't mean to pick on just you President Obama, though the US does have a lot to answer for, particularly on the issue of climate change.Those of you who are negotiating under the auspices of the G-77 -- could you please explain why you oppose a paragraph emphasizing that \"each country should implement national energy policies and low emission development strategies as indispensable to sustainable development... recognis[ing] that each state has the right to determine its national energy policies in accordance with its national requirements\"? Doesn't this naturally follow from your proposal to include the provision from the climate convention stating that \"countries should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\"? You're right that developed countries are obligated to take the lead, but the urgency of addressing climate change means that ALL countries need to adopt low-emission development strategies.And those of you in the European Union -- you've played such an important leadership role in the climate arena, but you lose the moral high ground when you play the bad guy on overseas development aid and fisheries. Trying to delete text aimed at eliminating subsidies for fisheries which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing is just not ok.Speaking of subsidies, those of you in the G20 have already agreed to a \"phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, taking into account vulnerable groups and their development needs.\" Instead of fighting over how the same goal should be reworded, how about giving us some clear commitments which move it forward, starting with a date by when this phase-out will be accomplished? You might find some additional ideas and inspiration in this submission by a broad group of organizations working on the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies.But please don't give up. There is still enough time -- just -- for you to get this right. An extra week of pre-Rio negotiations has now been allocated. You might want to ask your negotiators to do the following:If you're in need of inspiration, just take a look at these two-minute videos of young people telling you about the future they want.

Farm Sanctuary's new Melrose Small Animal Hospital is no different. At our sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York, Farm Sanctuary has just completed construction of a unique hospital for animals born and bred to be our food, who have suffered severe injury and disability at the hands of the factory farming industry. If an ER for calves, pigs, chickens, turkeys and goats seems extreme to you, you may be more out of touch with your food than you think.Animals exploited for meat, milk and eggs live short, miserable lives. They are systematically exposed to intense confinement, filth, crowded conditions and brutal abuses. Parts of their tails, toes, genitals, ears and beaks are cut off, without painkillers, to better mold them to the perversely unnatural and highly stressful environments of factory farms. It is common for farm animals in these environments to succumb to injury and disease, and every year hundreds of millions die before reaching the slaughterhouse. Factory farming subjects billions of animals to intolerable conditions and untimely deaths, while a majority of U.S. citizens unwittingly support this cruelty by consuming meat, milk and eggs.Jo-Anne McArthur/The Ghosts in Our MachineFarm Sanctuary was founded in 1986 to expose and challenge this system and to aid its victims. We care for cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, sheep and other animals who had been discarded in trash cans, in stockyard alley ways, on \"dead piles\" or who were found on the side of the road after falling out of transportation vehicles. In some cases, farm workers have intervened on the animals' behalf and brought refugees of this brutal industry to the safe pastures of Farm Sanctuary.Our new animal hospital will provide life-saving care to animals in distress, healing them so that, for the first time in their lives, they can experience peace and freedom. These individuals will serve as ambassadors for less fortunate members of their species who suffer hidden from public view on factory farms.This hospital will bring new efficacy to work we have conducted since long before its construction. One beneficiary of that work is Sonny, who we found when he was less than a day old, lying motionless in a filthy stockyard pen. As a male calf born into the dairy industry, he was considered a \"by-product\" to be sold for cheap veal or beef -- if not simply discarded as trash. Sonny's umbilical cord had been torn off leaving an open wound; he was sick from infection, dehydrated, and exhausted. Without intervention, he would have only known pain and suffering in this world. In this case, our caregivers were able to rush Sonny to Cornell University's Hospital for Animals, where he received a blood transfusion and antibiotics. Sonny recovered from this trauma with close follow-up attention, and he now flourishes at our New York Shelter in Watkins Glen. Today, other sick and injured animals, like Sonny, who are lucky enough to find their way out of the factory farming system will receive round-the-clock care at our new hospital dedicated to their special needs.Please see below for a gallery of BEFORE and AFTER images of animals who were given a second chance at life after being rescued and rehabilitated by Farm Sanctuary."}, {"title": "Hydrofracking Politics and Sustainability Management", "text": "If the abundant natural gas available as a bridge fuel on the road to renewable energy is to actually be utilized, Americans will need to believe that the gas being extracted does not damage the environment. The natural gas that we hope to mine will probably last for less than a hundred years. The ecosystems that sustain our food and water systems will need to last for thousands of years. In a disappointing move last week the federal government took us one step forward and two steps back on the hydrofracking issue. The step forward was the federal government's decision that companies engaged in hydrofracking on public lands would be required to disclose the chemical composition of their fracking fluids. The two steps back took place when the Department of the Interior caved in to industry pressure, and changed the proposed rule from requiring disclosure before fracking begins to requiring it after it is completed. It seems that the urgency of getting the gas out of the ground dominated any concerns about potential damage from fracking chemicals.According to Mathew Daley of the Associated Press:\"The new rules, which have been under consideration for a year and a half, were softened after industry groups expressed strong concerns about an initial proposal leaked earlier this year. The proposal would allow companies to file disclosure reports after drilling operations are completed, rather than before they begin, as initially proposed. Industry groups said the earlier proposal could have caused lengthy delays.\"If these gas drillers are worried about delay that results from filling out a few forms for the Department of the Interior, wait until they experience the delays that follow visible damage to a valuable source of groundwater. Lawsuits, demonstrations, teach-ins and a full activist onslaught will make these folks wish they had an effective and respected regulatory system to fall back on. Unfortunately, in this era of free market extremism, any steps taken to ensure safety and care of the environment are seen as a waste of time.The BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico ought to be a cautionary tale to these fracking fanatics. They should think about the drilling delays that followed that example of lax regulation. It is obvious to me that we need to increase our ability to generate energy to support the high throughput economy required throughout the world. If we are to manage the planet's resources sustainably we need to exploit those resources with great care. Speed is less important than the development of a predictable and safe supply of energy. That requires information about the impact that fossil fuel extraction has on the planet's ecosystems. When the impact is too great, the action causing it must be modified and sometimes stopped. If we stop the action before we damage the ecosystem the long term impact and its clean-up cost will be lower than if we stop it after the damage has been done. Knowing the chemicals used in hydrofracking after the fracking is over can facilitate the environmental clean-up; but knowing the chemicals ahead of time opens up the possibility of preventing the damage in the first place.Sustainability management requires that we get more sophisticated about the way we manage the planet and its resources. A more sophisticated and competent approach to management requires information, scientific analysis and the exercise of great care before we mine the planet's resources. A policy of fast and furious \"drill baby drill\" may generate some quick bucks, but will lead to mistakes, environmental damage and \"not in my back yard\" anti-development politics. A more careful approach will cut into short run profits, but still leaves plenty of cash on the table.Daley reported that:\"The industry also has complained that disclosure of chemicals used in fracking could violate trade secrets, although Salazar said the rule would include exemptions for specific formulas. Some of the chemicals used in fracking include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, all of which can cause health problems in significant doses.\"The Yiddish word for the trade secret argument is \"chutzpah,\" which the online dictionary defines as \"shameless audacity.\" Let me see if I understand this: You own or lease the land which contains the gas, you've built the well and installed the technology to extract the gas, and the competitive advantage and profit comes from the chemical composition of the liquid you inject to release the gas? This is the \"secret sauce\" of hydrofracking? Unbelievable.The idea that rules governing the development of scarce resources are anti-business is complete idiocy. Zoning the land in Manhattan has not destroyed the real estate business around here. Placing traffic lights on busy corners has not eliminated the sale of automobiles. Creating rules of the game can engender the certainty and stability needed to encourage investment and stimulate competition.The industry reaction against the Obama administration's rule proposing chemical disclosure prior to fracking was disheartening. The administration's inability to resist the pressure against the rule is scary. Opponents of regulation clearly have the upper hand in the midst of this Presidential election. Those of us hoping for effective regulation of fossil fuel extraction get to choose between the anti-regulatory zeal of Romney's supporters and the tepid, half measures of the Obama administration's Department of the Interior.While the federal government is caving, state and local governments are less predictable. Writing on the new fracking rule in the New York Times, John Broder observed that: \"A majority of the 13,000 wells drilled each year by fracking are on private lands and thus fall primarily under state regulation, as they have for 60 years.\" The wells that are not on federal lands are subject to state rules, which vary greatly from state to state. New York State is still studying its approach to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The move against federal rules on federal lands makes it unlikely that we will see national standards creating a uniform approach throughout the United States. This means we will have the opportunity to learn from a wide variety of approaches. It also means that it is almost inevitable that some mistakes will be made and some environmental damage will take place.Last week Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein in the Washington Post and Paul Krugman in the New York Times wrote about the polarization of American politics and the conservative slant of the Republican party. Krugman thinks it is due to income inequality and Mann and Ornstein blame it on the dynamics of political competition. Whatever the cause, my concern is that this extreme ideology makes it more difficult for the federal government to promulgate new or updated environmental rules. Since the new political reality is that all regulation is bad, it is politically prudent to leave old rules in place, even if new technology and new business practices make those rules ineffective or inappropriate.We need an agile, flexible and intelligent approach to regulation. Political ideology and political calculation make our rules more rigid and ineffective. There is a more pragmatic practical approach to regulation that sits somewhere between strait-jacket totalitarianism and the Wild West. We need to find that approach or the planet we rely on for food, air, water and energy will no longer be capable of providing us with those services. We need to manage, not destroy, the planet's resources. Finite resources such as fossil fuels must be mined and utilized with care. In the long run, a planet of ten billion people will need to build its economy on renewable resources. That high-tech green economy requires technology we do not yet have, and management capacity we must learn to develop. The nations that learn how to build partnerships between industry, government and universities will have the best chance of leading this new global economy. The ideological warfare in Washington makes it more difficult for America to assume that leadership role."}, {"title": "Thunderstorms And Ozone Examined In National Center For Atmospheric Research Study", "text": "From Becky Oskin, OurAmazingPlanet ContributorThunderstorms not only clobber the Earth's surface with heavy rain and lightning, they also shake things up at cloud level.This spring, scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and other organizations will explore what happens when storms bring air from Earth's surface many miles up into the atmosphere using research aircraft, mobile radars and lightning mapping arrays.One of the project's key goals is examining the role of thunderstorms in making upper-atmosphere ozone, a greenhouse gas that has a particularly strong warming effect high in the atmosphere and is tricky to track. (Ozone higher up in the atmosphere forms the familiar ozone layer that protects the planet's surface from harmful UV rays.)\"When thunderstorms form, air near the ground has nowhere to go but up,\" said NCAR scientist Mary Barth, a principal investigator on the project. \"Suddenly you have an air mass at high altitude that's full of chemicals that can produce ozone.\"The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment, which begins in mid-May, is the first to take a comprehensive look at the chemistry and thunderstorm details, including air movement, cloud physics and electrical activity. The experiment will examine the influence of thunderstorms on air just beneath the stratosphere, a little-explored region that influences Earth's climate and weather patterns.Updrafts within thunderstorm clouds travel at about 20 to 100 mph (about 30 to 160 kph), so air arrives at the top of the troposphere with its pollutants relatively intact. (The troposphere extends from Earth's surface to about 6 to 10 miles (10 to 16 kilometers) in altitude and is where most weather happens.) The polluted air masses stop rising because of a barrier between the troposphere and stratosphere called the tropopause.\"The tropopause is like a wall,\" Barth said. \"The air bumps into it and spreads out.\"The DC3 scientists will fly through updraft plumes to collect data as a storm is under way. Then they'll fly through the same air mass the next day, using its distinctive chemical signature to see how it's changed over time.Scientists will also study both how storms produce lightning as well as how to use lightning- mapping data to improve storm forecasts and warnings. [Images: Electric Earth]\"The internal structures of thunderstorms \u2014 and the lightning that accompanies them \u2014 differ considerably across the country,\" said Brad Smull, National Science Foundation program director for physical and dynamic meteorology. \"This in turn affects the chemical processes occurring inside these storms.\"The DC3 investigators will be based at three sites in northern Alabama, northeastern Colorado and central Oklahoma to west Texas. Flying from multiple sites will enable the scientists to study different types of atmospheric environments.Funding for DC3 comes from the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA. The scientists leading the project are from NCAR, Pennsylvania State University, Colorado State University and NOAA, with involvement by more than 100 researchers from 26 organizations.Follow OurAmazingPlanet for the latest in Earth science and exploration news on Twitter @OAPlanet and on Facebook."}, {"title": "On Mother's Day: Caring for All Creatures", "text": "This Mother's Day, as we celebrate our own mothers, we can also celebrate the many people who adopt other species, wild and domestic, and love them as their own. Sometimes it takes a village to practice this interspecies adoption.In Nova Scotia, the village of Guysborough adopted an orphaned wild beluga calf they named Wilma. The two-year-old beluga swam lonely circles in the harbor. Wilma used floating buoys as her toys and rubbed up against boats so often that her white flanks were often gashed and scarred from propeller wounds. Yet true to the nature of this sociable species, Wilma continued to playfully approach boats to greet schoolchildren and tourists. So fishermen designed a protective box for their outboard motors. Village elders set their clocks by her and one couple said, \"In the evening, we like to hear Wilma make noises like snoring. It's very reassuring.\"Though Wilma was what scientists call a \"lone, sociable,\" who had somehow lost her mother and her pod, she was rarely alone in the harbor. At a town meeting, the whole village of Guysborough turned out to hear how they could best adopt and care for Wilma. They brought in Cathy Kinsman of the Canadian Whale Stewardship Project and marine mammal biologist, Dr. Toni Frohoff. Villagers wanted their conservation help to protect Wilma from any outside captive industry who might condemn Wilma to life in a tank.\"Wilma trusts us, don't you know,\" a grizzled boatman said. \"She's our responsibility. Just tell us what Wilma needs.\"The Whale Stewardship Program helped educate Guysborough about how to best watch over their baby beluga in the wild.When I visited Guysborough, the boatman took us out to meet Wilma. I was struck by how young she seemed as she exchanged a long, childlike gaze. In Wilma's eyes were all the loneliness and need, the dependence and trust of a human child. Wilma was alone of all her kind, yet surrounded by well-meaning people. She had the plaintive, engaging look of a child awaiting adoption. And this village had the earnest, anxious attitude of adoptive parents.I realized that here was another kind of family model, an interspecies kinship new and fragile, awkward and inexperienced. But this was a model for what the future might be, between species that increasingly must meet. To adapt a scientific term, here was the human version of allomothering -- caring for non-maternal offspring.Animals who allomother offspring other than their own include aunties, uncles, siblings, and even non-relatives who babysit, feed, and protect the infants from predators. Animal allomothers spend time with the infant so the mother can forage, rest, and meet her own needs. Infants who enjoy such cooperative care have a much higher rate of survival in the wild. And if the mother dies, these offspring are often adopted and their lives saved.There are benefits to being allomothers. In baboon society, primatologist Barbara Smuts observed that young male baboons who offered friendship, babysitting, grooming, and companionship to elder matriarchs, were often chosen as mates.When humans offer allomothering to other species, it often requires remarkable adaptability and advocacy. It's natural to love one's birth child. But what if the creature you are trying to mother is covered with hair, or bites you, or claws you, or has a grasping tail? What if that baby needs to sleep in a pouch, or in a tree, or requires a diet that includes moose scat or pureed fish? And what if that baby animal is endangered or weighs tons at birth?In another village on the remote Baja peninsula, San Ignacio Lagoon, generations of villagers have protected gray whales in their birthing lagoons. Since the 1970s, when Renulfo Mayoral's father, Pachiko, first documented what scientists call \"The Friendly Whale Syndrome,\" villagers have served as naturalists and boatmen to researchers and tourists who seek a unique encounter with the great gray whales.As well as being the foremost naturalist in this lagoon, Renulfo is training the next generation in stewardship of the gray whales. He looks on proudly when his first young female boatman, Lupita, navigates the exhilarating encounter with baby gray whales practically leaping into our boat to be touched.\"My grandfather taught me to love las ballenas, the gray whales,\" Lupita says. \"They are my relatives who visit every year.\"Closer to home in my own Seattle neighborhood of Alki Beach, a group of dedicated volunteers, called Seal Sitters, sit vigil over seals who spend half their lives sharing our shores. On a busy urban beach like Alki, dogs off leash and curious people can disturb the pup's vital rest and scare him back into the water where he may not find his mother again. Weaned pups just learning to fish especially need to rest. Fifty percent of seal pups do not survive their first year. So the Seal Sitters, trained by NOAA, protect the seal and educate the many passersby until the seal can return to the water.When we adopt another species, we reach out past the boundaries that keep us lonely and limited to just \"me and mine.\" Now as we face massive extinctions of other animals, we can expand the way we love. In the words of the wise Mongolian family in the film, The Weeping Camel -- allomothers know that \"the heart, whether human or animal, knows no borders.\"Brenda Peterson is a National Geographic author of 17 books, including the memoirs I Want to be Left Behind and Build Me an Ark: A Life with Animals.

He wrote State Farm the following letter, and gave me permission to publish it here.What do you think? Should mainstream corporations give money to groups like Heartland that deny mainstream science?May 7, 2012State Farm InsuranceOne State Farm PlazaBloomington, IL 61710Dear State Farm,As per a recent conversation with Tony Ardise, my State Farm agent, I provided him two weeks' notice that I intend to cancel all of my policies with State Farm Insurance because of its support of Heartland Institute. I have been a loyal customer for over 21 years and currently send almost $4,500 per year to State Farm. I do not wish my money to be sent to Heartland Institute -- a group that recently compared climate scientists and those concerned about climate change to \"murderers, tyrants, and madmen\" such as Ted Kaczynski (Unabomber), Charles Manson, Fidel Castro, and Osama bin Laden. Although Heartland stated that they will remove the public billboards, their official statement offers no apologies. It is obvious that the billboards represent Heartland's true feelings.This indefensible and un-American assault on climate science is just the latest attempt by Heartland to discourage action on climate change, but there is a long history. As has been widely reported in mainstream media, Heartland Institute has been leading the charge for years to confuse our policymakers, the general public, and our school children about well-understood climate change science.The United States National Academy of Sciences tells us that the climate is warming, humans are responsible, and that this behavior is increasing risks across a broad spectrum of society. Every international academy of science agrees and recent studies show that 97-98% of publishing experts concur.Who else is concerned? Military and intelligence experts warn that climate-induced crises could topple governments, feed terrorist movements or destabilize entire regions and health officials warn us that climate change could be the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. These are experts who are warning us of a serious problem. We need to listen to these experts and not to Heartland Institute.State Farm states: \"We're working with organizations all across the country -- organizations like the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Protecting America - to help protect you and your family from the human injuries, property destruction, and financial impact that can result from natural disasters.\" Climate change has been shown to have increased the frequency and intensity of droughts, fires, heat waves, and floods. Along with sea level rise, these types of disasters have already cost your industry many billions of dollars according to financial experts. I find it quite disturbing that State Farm would send money to a group that is clearly hurting its bottom line. Would the American Lung Association send money to Philip Morris?General Motors and AT&T have publicly stated they will no longer fund Heartland Institute. State Farm should immediately do the same. If so, I will remain a loyal customer. Otherwise, I will take my business elsewhere.Sincerely,Scott A.

According to a 2010 CDC study, over one-third of U.S. adults are obese. A recent Gallup poll notes that two-thirds of Americans think of themselves as over their target weight, regardless of their actual size.The Gallup poll also mentioned that three in 10 Americans are currently trying to lose weight, and over 66% have made a serious dieting effort at some point in their lives.However noble the efforts, not all diets are equal. While specialty diets, like juice detoxes and Atkins may seem appealing, they tend to have very low long-term success rates.If you are thinking about losing weight, PETA suggests trying out a vegan diet. The Academy of Nutrition And Dietetics (previously the American Dietetic Association) says that \u201cappropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.\u201dBeyond your health, going meatless can also be beneficial to animal welfare and the environment.

According to a recent survey carried out by Yale University, Americans now associate those recent warm winters and blistering hot summers with human induced climate change. In March alone, over 7,000 warm weather records were broken all across the country.Since 1880, global temperatures have risen by around 0.8C. And according to the UKCIP, most of that increase has been over the past 25 years, with a rise of 0.2C each decade. If humanity continues down this current trajectory, it may approach its demise in the not too distant future.Last month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that the world is heading towards a 6C temperature rise by the end of this century: \"Energy-related CO2 emissions are at historic highs, we estimate that energy use and CO2 emissions would almost double by 2050.\"It says that global efforts to rein in carbon emissions have not been enough; we are standing on the brink of irreversible climate change.According to the World Health Organization, global warming already claims over 150,000 lives a year. In the words of Jim Hansen, NASA's leading climate scientist, extreme weather has become a grave \"moral issue on par with slavery.\"If this is our reality now, imagine what kind of dawn a 6C temperature rise will bring. According to the Climate Change Research Centre, it will create something \"similar to the depths of the last ice age.\"In other words, a global catastrophe sits on our collective horizon. And, \"no place on the planet can remain an island of affluence in a sea of misery\" says Maurice Strong, Secretary-General of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.\"We are standing at an unprecedented crossroads\"; the choices we make now will \"profoundly\" affect our global future, says Zero Carbon Britain. And \"It's time for us to grow up\" because we are facing a \"war for civilization\" says Paul Gilding, author of The Great Disruption. But, \"this could be our finest hour.\"It's time for world leaders to step up to the plate. When they gather for the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit next month, they must commit to a new \"green\" deal. Striking a new agreement this year is critical -- it means that we can step away from this precipice of terminal climate change.Sadly, worries about the economy are eclipsing concerns about the health of our planet. But, as conservation biologist Richard Steiner points out, \"the 'ecological debt' that we are accruing is far more consequential that our financial debt.\"He says that we need an \"emergency environmental stimulus package\" of $300 billion per annum. This seems reasonable compared to the $1.6 trillion the world spends every year on defense.Secondly, we need to rein in global carbon emissions. And, we can all play our part by; insulating our homes; buying less stuff; driving electric cars and planting more trees. But, as the global energy sector generates two thirds of those emissions, we must embrace a future powered by renewable energy.   According to the world's top scientists, half of all our power must come from green sources by 2035. And, although this may seem like a Herculean task, it's not -- renewable energy already accounts for 16% of all electricity worldwide.Moreover, as global oil and gas supplies are running out, it makes complete economic sense. According to the World Wildlife Fund, if everyone on the planet used as much oil as the average person living in Singapore, our proven oil reserves would run out in less than 9 years time.Investing in green energy will also help to revive our flagging global economy. According to the Millennium Institute, if just twelve G20 nations invested as little as 2% of their GDP over the next 5 years, it would create nearly 50 million new \"decent\" jobs.Victor Hugo once said that \"nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\" The idea for a sustainable future; it's time has come, for if temperatures rise by 6C, it will mark the end of life as we know it.What lies before us is the greatest challenge of our time, and we must not fail. In the words of Winston Churchill, \"the empires of the future are the empires of the mind.\" So, let's strive towards those empires; for it is here, and only here, that our children's children will find the empires of their future."}, {"title": "Climate Impact Day", "text": "I made my climate change dot out of the information I've discovered, slowly, painfully, over the last couple of years developing a reforestation project in Brazil, where I was born. There were so many things that just didn't fit together, until last week when I found the missing piece: deforestation and reforestation are both profitable. Climate change is just one of the costs of doing business, if you happen to be in the right business. Dow Chemical and Monsanto are.So I put myself in their shoes to take a different perspective:If you have a bad rap for your history creating Agent Orange, first of all, get rid of the stockpile. You could send it to South America and maybe people there would forget about it. Carnival and all. Or not. Maybe someday, someone would find it and figure out that it's an easy way to take out the rainforest without smoke being detected.Once the trees are gone, you might as well sell your GMO soy and corn seed, and all the fertilizers it takes to grow them the (North) American way. Oh yeah. Cotton too. Lots of GMO cotton. It's a big country, you can really plant a lot of stuff there.And business is all about partnerships, strategic alliances. So it would be a good idea to partner with some good guys, with well known names and stellar reputations to clean up any misgivings folks might have about you. Dow chose The Nature Conservancy (or maybe TNC chose Dow?), while Monsanto chose Conservation International.Whoa, what do know? Those two organizations have big reforestation projects in the 93 percent deforested Atlantic Rainforest! What a great opportunity to help them with supplying all the seedlings they'll need for their billion tree initiative.And since TNC/Dow were able to make arrangements with the state of Sao Paulo's Water Supply Managers (SABESP) to help supply trees for planting along the source of water for nearly nine million people, it's really good news for these guys. Not so good for the network of rural Brazilians who started nurseries to supply the demand organically, but those guys don't have good internet access or read English, so they're not going to figure this out for a long time.And this is 2012, a year when all sorts of things are aligning nicely. The Dr. Seuss story The Lorax was made into a movie by Universal this year, and since they were green enough to know they ought to partner with BINGOs (Big International NGOs) who could plant trees for them, they chose TNC and CI to do the heavy lifting for them.Isn't it amazing what you can learn from Google, if you just ask the right questions?"}, {"title": "Japan Nuclear Reactors Shut Off, Thousands March To Celebrate", "text": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Japanese marched to celebrate the switching off of the last of their nation's 50 nuclear reactors Saturday, waving banners shaped as giant fish that have become a potent anti-nuclear symbol.Japan was without electricity from nuclear power for the first time in four decades when the reactor at Tomari nuclear plant on the northern island of Hokkaido went offline for mandatory routine maintenance.After last year's March 11 quake and tsunami set off meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, no reactor halted for checkups has been restarted amid public worries about the safety of nuclear technology.\"Today is a historic day,\" Masashi Ishikawa shouted to a crowd gathered at a Tokyo park, some holding traditional \"koinobori\" carp-shaped banners for Children's Day that have become a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement.\"There are so many nuclear plants, but not a single one will be up and running today, and that's because of our efforts,\" Ishikawa said.The activists said it is fitting that the day Japan stopped nuclear power coincides with Children's Day because of their concerns about protecting children from radiation, which Fukushima Dai-ichi is still spewing into the air and water.The government has been eager to restart nuclear reactors, warning about blackouts and rising carbon emissions as Japan is forced to turn to oil and gas for energy.Japan now requires reactors to pass new tests to withstand quakes and tsunami and to gain local residents' approval before restarting.The response from people living near nuclear plants has been mixed, with some wanting them back in operation because of jobs, subsidies and other benefits to the local economy.The mayor of Tomari city, Hiroomi Makino, is among those who support nuclear power.\"There may be various ways of thinking but it's extremely regrettable,\" he said of the shutdown.Major protests, like the one Saturday, have been generally limited to urban areas like Tokyo, which had received electricity from faraway nuclear plants, including Fukushima Dai-ichi.Before the nuclear crisis, Japan relied on nuclear power for a third of its electricity.The crowd at the anti-nuclear rally, estimated at 5,500 by organizers, shrugged off government warnings about a power shortage. If anything, they said, with the reactors going offline one by one, it was clear the nation didn't really need nuclear power.Whether Japan will suffer a sharp power crunch is still unclear.Electricity shortages are expected only at peak periods, such as the middle of the day in hot weather, and critics of nuclear power say proponents are exaggerating the consequences to win public approval to restart reactors.Hokkaido Electric Power Co. spokesman Hisatoshi Kibayashi said the shutdown was completed late Saturday.The Hokkaido Tomari plant has three reactors, but the other two had been halted earlier. Before March 11 last year, the nation had 54 nuclear reactors, but four of the six reactors at Fukushima Dai-ichi are being decommissioned because of the disaster.Yoko Kataoka, a retired baker who was dancing to the music at the rally waving a small paper carp, said she was happy the reactor was being turned off.\"Let's leave an Earth where our children and grandchildren can all play without worries,\" she said, wearing a shirt that had, \"No thank you, nukes,\" handwritten on the back.___Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at http://twitter.com/yurikageyama"}, {"title": "Climate Impacts Day: 350.org Campaign Connects The Dots Between Extreme Weather And Climate Change", "text": "Colorful photos and live video streamed in from events held in more than 100 countries on Saturday where citizens are \"connecting the dots\u201d between global climate change and extreme weather events.The events, part of \u201cClimate Impacts Day\u201d and coordinated by international climate campaign 350.org, demonstrate how a string of weather disasters around the world provide mounting evidence of the hazards incurred by global warming.\u201cWe just celebrated Earth Day.

The once feared \"Heartland Institute,\" funded by the secretive Koch brothers in their campaign to undermine science and deny the plain evidence for climate change has just committed a very public suicide on the Eisenhower Expressway on the outskirts of Chicago.That is where the first billboard appeared the other day to launch what has to be one of the kookiest public relations campaigns in history. I could scarcely believe my eyes when I saw the image on the internet -- the disheviled \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski glowering down at commuters asking: \"I still believe in Global Warming. Do you?\" The weirdest part of it is that the Heartland folks actually put their name on the bottom of it for all to see. In other words, the notorious group has come out of the shadows (where they have been lurking for the last decade or so funding false front groups and harassing hard-working scientists) and finally fessed up to being the kooks and fanatics that we long suspected they were.The free market \"think tank\" was discredited in February when documents leaked to the press revealed its plans to disseminate a new school curriculum which aims at \"dissuading teachers from teaching science.\" The documents detail how the organization has funded a rogue's gallery of debunkers (mostly non-scientists) to sow seeds of doubt about the clear consensus of researchers worldwide that our climate is warming due to the rising levels of CO2 released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.But evidently this huge public fiasco only whetted Heartland's appetite for punishment. The billboard campaign which they have just initiated will undoubtedly finish off the spectacular crash and burn which the leaked \"Climategate\" memos initiated. The Kaczynski ad is only the first in the goofy series which are being put up in preparation for the group's so-called \"7th Annual Conference on Climate Change\" scheduled for the end of this month. Still to come are billboards featuring Charles Manson, Fidel Castro, Osama bin Laden and James J. Lee (who took hostages inside the headquarters of the Discovery Channel in 2010).\"These rogues and villains were chosen,\" Heartland revealed, \"because they made public statements about how man-made global warming is a crisis and how mankind must take immediate and drastic actions to stop it.\"Really? But not to go overboard... \"Of course, not all global warming alarmists are murderers or tyrants,\" Heartland reluctantly concedes.

At the time Heartland described the person doing this, David Wojick, as a climate science expert who works for the U.S. Department of Energy. I contacted DOE spokesperson Jen Stuntsman, who told me Wojick was actually a part-time computer database contractor who \"has never advised or conducted research for the Department on climate change or any other scientific topic.\"This week, Heartland went live with billboards in the Chicago area further promoting their view, but the billboards are not what a typical soccer mom would normally expect of an organization preparing a curriculum having to do with schoolchildren and science. Here's one of them, which appears along the inbound Eisenhower Expressway (I-290) in Maywood:A news release from Heartland says \"the billboard series features Ted Kaczynski, the infamous Unabomber; Charles Manson, a mass murderer; and Fidel Castro, a tyrant. Other global warming alarmists who may appear on future billboards include Osama bin Laden and James J. Lee (who took hostages inside the headquarters of the Discovery Channel in 2010).\"Heartland Institute spokesman Jim Lakely said that the outfit chose to make the false association on the billboards \"because what these murderers and madmen have said differs very little from what spokespersons for the United Nations, journalists for the 'mainstream' media, and liberal politicians say about global warming.\"The billboard campaign shows a shocking lack of judgment by an organization that has become so radicalized that it would publicly characterize the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the U.S. Defense Department, NASA, NOAA and other mainstream science organizations and federal agencies as \"the radical fringe\" for acknowledging what billions of data points all show: that human behavior is warming the planet, and seek to associate these organizations in public billboards on family-traveled highways with mass murderers and tyrants. This exposure of families and schoolchildren to the darker aspects of propaganda suggests the Heartland Institute's leadership has sunk to a juvenile bully's level of moral and ethical development.The Heartland Institute gets much of its funding from mainstream American corporations and their associated foundations.

Every community should be free from the threat of a chemical disaster, not just our capital.\"The New York Times editorial is one more voice among a chorus calling on President Obama and Lisa Jackson to protect Americans from these dangerous chemical plants. Last month, former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman urged her successor to take action \"before a tragedy of historic proportions occurs.\"The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council has also appealed to Jackson, because poorer and disadvantaged communities are often closest and most at risk from the chemical plants, oil refineries and water treatment plants that use and store these dangerous chemicals.Greenpeace is part of a coalition of more than 100 labor, environmental, health and environmental justice organizations that are urging President Obama and Lisa Jackson to follow through on the president's 2008 pledge to \"Secure our chemical plants by setting a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must follow, including improving barriers, containment, mitigation and safety training, and wherever possible, using safer technology, such as less toxic chemicals.\""}, {"title": "What Are They Trying to Hide?", "text": "Odds are that you haven't heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. And even if you've heard of it, I'm willing to bet you don't know what might be in it. That's because, although this massive new trade agreement could have profound implications for our environment, our health, and the rights of workers, it is being negotiated in almost complete secrecy.The Sierra Club has worked on trade policy for nearly two decades for one simple reason: trade rules have a huge impact on environmental protections. In 1998, for example, the World Trade Organization ordered the U.S. to weaken Endangered Species Act protections for sea turtles being killed in shrimp-fishing nets. And in an ongoing dispute, a U.S. corporation, Renco Group, is suing the government of Peru for $800 million under the free trade agreement between the U.S. and Peru. Why? Because Peru denied the corporation a third extension on its obligation to clean up pollutants and contaminants from a metallic smelter that Renco invested in. These are just two examples.So when the United States and eight other Pacific Rim countries meet in Dallas later this month to finalize the TPP, which they're calling a \"21st-century trade agreement,\" we'll be there, too. We want the negotiators to know: We are deeply concerned about both the process and the direction of these talks.There's nothing wrong with encouraging trade. But let's do it right. A fair global trading system should improve the quality of life for all parties; it must include meaningful and enforceable environmental and labor standards that make it possible for communities to both provide for themselves and protect their environment. Because corporations are usually at the forefront of crafting trade agreements -- and civil society is not -- the end product primarily serves corporate interests -- often at the expense of the people whose lives they affect.Exacerbating the problem, the scope of international trade agreements now extends far beyond the bounds of regulating trade. They also affect how products are actually made. For example, none of the trade pacts the U.S. has signed allows a country to give preference to products made with recycled content or to products made by workers who are paid decent wages with benefits.In fact, virtually every free trade agreement we've negotiated since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has contained language that lets foreign corporations sue governments directly -- in private and non-transparent tribunals -- for unlimited cash compensation over almost any domestic law (environmental or otherwise) that the corporation argues might hurt its profitability. The sole exception is our free trade agreement with Australia -- because the Australian government refused to allow its laws to be attacked by foreign corporations.That was smart, because corporations have been quick to take advantage of this ability to attack a country's laws and protections. By the end of 2011, corporations (including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, and Cargill) had brought 450 disputes worth hundreds of millions of dollars against the governments of 89 countries. Many of those cases directly targeted environmental and other public interest laws.For example, a Canadian mining company, Pacific Rim Mining Corp., through a U.S. subsidiary, is currently using the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) to sue the government of El Salvador for $200 million for attempting to safeguard its people and environment from environmentally devastating mining practices. Just last year, Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company that controls two nuclear power plants in Germany, brought a case against Germany regarding that country's nuclear phaseout.Unfortunately, unless we change how these agreements are negotiated, the TPP will certainly follow this same, deeply flawed model, which grants unprecedented rights to corporations. A true \"21st-century trade agreement\" should be looking to rein in corporate power -- not expand it. And it certainly shouldn't be negotiated in total secrecy behind closed doors.The first step toward ensuring that we don't end up with a flawed Trans-Pacific Partnership is to bring these negotiations into the light of day. As former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, \"Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\" In Dallas, we'll deliver a petition, signed by thousands of Sierra Club members and supporters, that calls on the United States to publicly release all TPP proposals. Please add your name and tell the U.S. Trade Representative: We deserve to know exactly what it is that trade negotiators are proposing in our name."}, {"title": "The World Begins to 'Connect the Dots'", "text": "Striking images and video are beginning to stream in from more than 1,000 events in more than 100 countries where people are \"connecting the dots\" between climate change and extreme weather.

The website Vegetarians Are Evil, for instance, makes such meaningless revelations as identifying Genghis Khan as a vegetarian.HuffPost has compiled a slideshow parodying Heartland's ploy for media attention, because it seems like the only rational response. We make some equally empty observations -- Kim Kardashian still believes in marriage; Donald Trump still believes in great hair; Charlie Sheen still believes in winning -- and we ask our readers: Do you?UPDATE: 5:40 p.m. -- The Heartland Institute has pulled its digital billboard featuring Ted Kaczynski, which ran for just 24 hours before going dark.

A few days ago a small clan of angels arrived on my patio without my invitation or knowledge. They were discovered by me when I hurriedly went into my storage closet to grab a book early one Saturday morning. I noticed that the stray mother cat, who usually runs when I open the door leading to the patio, was not leaving and was making strange sounds at me. I thought something must be wrong with her and about the time I was convincing myself to simply ignore her, I saw the flower pot full of kittens. I was quite surprised.After I recovered from my surprise, I began to think about what on earth I would do with this little clan. I was busy trying to get ready to conduct a workshop on racial healing as well as putting the finishing touches on our wellness day activities at church. I was too busy for this intrusion and I did not really want to have think about a stray cat and her babies at this time. So I called a few friends to see if they could help me find a place for the kittens, only to learn that the problem of unwanted stray animals is very severe in our town. Last year we killed over 2000 unwanted animals and at the present time, everyone engaged in cat rescue has more cats than they can manage. I was horrified at the suggestion of calling animal control. Even though I was not prepared to take care of them, I certainly did not want to contribute to their being killed.I described the situation in my plea for help at church on Sunday as a \"pastoral crisis\" and I was not trying to be dramatic. This was a situation that I wanted to avoid. I did not want to begin to offer hospitality to this little family because I knew that I was not prepared to start raising cats at this stage in my life. But neither was I prepared to watch this mother try to feed her little flock without having adequate food and water for herself. So by Sunday afternoon I had resigned myself to the fact that I needed to buy a sack of cat food and begin to feed the mother. I have always owned dogs and since childhood I have not paid much attention to cats.The kittens stayed in the flower pot for two or three days and then they began to try climbing out to a larger world. Two of them were able to get out alone. But the other two spent an entire day trying to get out and failing, only to give up and sleep for awhile before trying again. By the end of the day I decided to help them out of the flower pot, even though I wondered if I might be interferring with their natural developmental process. They seemed to be grateful to have a chance to get back with their mother so they could get food.It has been two weeks now since I discovered these little angels and I have learned a lot. First of all, the opportunity to offer hospitality does not necessarily arrive at a convenient time. Along with this is the keen awareness that I am connected to these animals and that they were sent to my patio so we could share gifts with one another. At this point I am offering food, shelter, safety and a trip to the vet for the mother cat to be spayed so that she will not continue to contribute to the unwanted cat population in this city.It has been made clear to me that I only need to do what I can to help and nothing more. I do not have to keep this entire group of cats simply because I am helping them now. Also this has helped me to be a bit more compassionate toward folks who are reluctant to get involved with those in need. I understand their hesitancy a little better and how big the challenge to push beyond it can be.It has been a great joy to watch these little kittens learn to use the litter box, explore my small patio, create entertainment for themselves by climbing upon the patio rails and legs of the chairs. I have observed them as they joyfully play with one another, sleep with great contentment and as they are beginning to sense that I am not a foe. What a wonderful set of blessings and lessons they have brought to me. What a wonderful gift they are. I am continuing the search for good homes for them and I will miss them when they are living elsewhere. But I will always be thankful for the gift of their presence, that I have helped to save their lives and that angels come in all sizes and shapes."}, {"title": "Saudi Arabia on the Hudson? Why Water Speculators Want Desalination in the Moist Northeast", "text": "Here's a cautionary tale about husbanding water resources in the 21st century.   Suppose you live near a picturesque, estuarine river, where the environment is sensitive and the water is salty. It's a desirable place, commutable to a major city, so it's under some development pressure, but it still has open space including parklands dotted with big, beautiful freshwater lakes in the north, and a large reservoir to the south. Now imagine a for-profit, multinational corporation has privatized the public water resources, and is siphoning off the drinking water you've been getting from your county's own reservoir to sell it in a neighboring state. They propose to replace your reservoir water with treated brackish water from a hugely expensive, energy-intensive and environmentally damaging desalination plant they'd build on the salty river, just 3.5 miles from a leaking nuclear power plant, and stick you, the ratepayer, with the enormous bill. Imagine that government regulators don't seem to object, even though many thousands of residents are incensed, and the narrow window for public input is rapidly closing.   Where could something like this happen? Desalination plants are usually last resorts for arid places that have little choice. You'd expect situations like this might occur in Saudi Arabia, but in fact, this is precisely what's happening today in suburban Rockland County, New York, on the Hudson River opposite the aging, leaking Indian Point nuclear plant. United Water New York (UWNY) has chosen it as a test case for building its first big desalination plant in the northeastern US. It would create a destructive, far-reaching precedent for desalination in water-rich areas as a tool for water speculators.   The proposed plant would generate huge profits for UWNY and United Water New Jersey (UWNJ), both subsidiaries of the French-based multinational corporation Suez Environnement, which privatizes water resources and builds desalination plants (yes, including in Saudi Arabia) worldwide. It made over $18 billion in 2010. Incidentally, its parent company GDF Suez is a major owner/operator of nuclear plants, which may explain why it isn't deterred by radioactive isotopes leaking from the nearby nuclear plant.  Rockland residents would bear the capital costs of the new plant, while UWNY would also charge them for the desalinated water. UWNY's affiliate United Water New Jersey would make additional money by selling more water from Rockland's DeForest Lake Reservoir to New Jersey. Between 1991 and 2007 United Water discharged roughly double its permitted limits to New Jersey and was fined for this in 2007. Yet when the reservoir was built, the NYS authorization for it stated that it was to be \"operated solely for the benefit of the citizens of Rockland County. The only benefit to the Hackensack Water Company (United Water New Jersey) and the people of New Jersey is the incidental benefit of a regulated flow in the river.\" The desalinization plant would countermand that, pitting the interests and water rights of Rockland against New Jersey, with United Water profiting at both ends.  That's a precedent that should concern you, whether you live in the Northeast, where United Water is seeking to expand and further privatize public water resources, or in dry places like Arizona, or really anywhere that depends on local or remote water resources. The US is not Saudi Arabia and is not suffering much from water scarcity -- yet. Experts predict that population growth, climate change and other factors may make it an issue here by mid-century, generating more conflict over water rights. But all over America, this will happen much, much sooner if we allow multinational corporations to privatize our water resources and manage them for exorbitant profits rather than sustainable use.  NYS Department of Environmental Conservation held just one day of public hearings on this complex and far-reaching issue, and gave the public and local governments just 90 days months to absorb United Water's 4,000-page Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) before it closed the public comment period. Elected officials called for an extension, including in a resolution that passed the Rockland Legislature unanimously, and a letter from the Rockland County Executive, but they didn't get it. Very few people have even read the DEIS, but among those who have are an independent economist hired by the citizens' group Rockland Water Coalition, who found it riddled with gaps, questionable methodologies and unreliable cost estimates.Though public comment is closed, citizen groups oppposed to the plant fight on. Some 20,000 residents signed have petitions opposing it; wherever you live you can join them here. Meanwhile this issue, with its big regional and national implications, is still more or less under the radar."}, {"title": "New Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline Permit Rejected by Nebraska Residents", "text": "TransCanada\u2019s latest Keystone XL tar sands pipeline plan filed with the U.S. State Department has done nothing to quell local Nebraska opposition to the controversial project to pipe tar sands oil all the way to the Gulf for export. Nebraska residents say the massive pipeline plan still jeopardizes the world\u2019s largest fresh drinking water source, the Ogallala Aquifer, risking the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers across country\u2019s breadbasket. Jane Kleeb, director of Bold Nebraska, a local grassroots group of farmers, ranchers and concerned citizens, immediately blasted the plan and said they will continue to fight it.\u201cThe fundamental facts remain, Americans are being asked to put clean water at risk and Nebraskans are being asked to give up their property rights for an extreme form of energy that will add nothing to our energy security. We are subsidizing this extreme form of energy to boot with over 1 billion of our tax payer dollars used to retrofit a Saudi-owned refinery for their tar sands headed straight to the export market.\u201dWatch Jane Kleeb explain why Nebraskans are opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline, part of an upcoming NRDC series of videos, Voices Against Tar Sands, focusing on local opposition to tar sands mining and pipeline projects.Last January, President Obama rejected TransCanada\u2019s 1,700 mile pipeline proposal to ship over 800,000 barrels of tar sands oil daily to Gulf refineries after House Republicans tried to short-cut the environmental review process. Now with TransCanada\u2019s latest plan, the State Department will reset the wheels of a lengthy review process to determine the project\u2019s environmental risks and whether it meets sufficient criteria to be in the national interest. NRDC\u2019s Anthony Swift blogs that both are clear-cut reasons to reject the pipeline outright;A rigorous review of Keystone XL will show that this tar sands pipeline is not in the U.S. national interest. It is not a pipeline to the United States but a pipeline through it, putting America\u2019s heartland, rivers and aquifers at risk so tar sands producers can sell their product to international buyers at higher prices. While that may be in the interests of tar sands producers and their financial backers, it\u2019s not in the interest of the American public.The Keystone XL pipeline has become a red-hot lightning rod for politicians pushing Big Oil\u2019s misinformation campaign of hugely inflated jobs numbers and their specious arguments about national security. The truth is this is about oil industry profits and political gamesmanship, pure and simple.That was clearly on display this week when House Republicans attached a provision to approve the Keystone XL project to their Surface Transportation extension bill, a blatant political ploy to deep-six bipartisan efforts to pass a national transportation program that would provide the nation with desperately-needed construction jobs. As NRDC\u2019s Susan Casey-Lefkowitz points out in her recent blog, politicians are more interested in scoring political points during an election year than solving tough economic problems and putting Americans back to work.The Keystone XL pipeline threatens American homes, farms, and ranches with tar sands oil spills and the extreme weather effects of worsening climate change. It raises oil prices. It derails continued growth in clean energy jobs. It funnels money to foreign oil corporations. Clean transportation solutions and fuel efficiency -- not another tar sands pipeline -- is the only way to protect America\u2019s economy, energy security, health, and environment. Congress should pass the bi-partisan Senate transportation bill and stop playing politics with our transportation future.So who wins with the Keystone XL tar sands project? Not the people whose land has been taken to build a dangerous pipeline they don\u2019t want, land that would put Americans at risk yet would give them no benefits in the end. If you want to really find out who wins with this tar sands pipeline boondoggle, just follow the money to the Big Oil lobbyists and the politicians they fund in Washington. They're the ones who will be laughing all the way to the bank if this pipeline is built, while the rest of us bear the risk and the consequences of one of the most destructive projects on earth."}, {"title": "Atomic Rate Rigging and the New China Syndrome", "text": "Small wonder the death knell of new U.S. nukes may be upon us.Two reactors proposed for Florida will now, say its would-be builders, cost $24 billion or more... up from their original maximum guess of $4 billion each... far beyond comparable renewables and efficiency.  Two Georgia nukes still wanting tax-funded loan guarantees have been caught pouring faulty concrete and using non-design rebar steel.Currently licensed reactors from California to Vermont, from Texas to Ohio to Florida are leaking radiation, shut for faulty steam generator tubes, closed for failed repairs running over $1 billion and being fought tooth and nail by local downwinders who are tired of rate rigging and want them shut forever.But the fate of the Earth may ultimately rest on which China emerges after Fukushima: the green one pushing solar, or the dictatorship pushing nukes that threaten us all.What we Americans can do about it remains problematic.But shutting down our own industry begins with killing proposed federal loan guarantees for two new nukes at Vogtle, Georgia, and stopping the rate rigging being perpetrated to build two more at South Carolina's V.C. Summer.Throughout the U.S., wanna-be nuke builders are pushing regulators and legislatures to force ratepayers to foot the bill for new reactors while they're being built. In Iowa, Missouri and Florida, an angry public is pushing back -- hard.Progress Energy's staggering new cost estimate for Levy County is a game changer. The idea of paying $12 billion each for reactors that can't even begin construction for at least three years is beyond scale. Progress has blown at least $1 billion on its botched repair and expansion job at north Florida's Crystal River, which may now never reopen.Failed steam generator tubes at California's San Onofre may also keep two reactors there forever shut. In Vermont, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and virtually every other home to geezer nukes, grassroots opposition has seriously escalated. Sooner or later, they will win. We must all pray that happens before yet another nuke blows. It will be a close call.In part because fracking (another environmental disaster) has made natural gas so cheap, and in part because the price of wind and solar continues to plummet, 2011 was the first year since deep in the Bush administration that the Executive Branch did not ask for new reactor loan guarantees. If the money can be nixed for Vogtle, and the rate rigging for Summer defeated, the whole \"nuclear renaissance\" could definitively disappear.Small modular nukes must still be fought. But the numbers on this imperfected technology do not work without massive taxpayer subsidies or public liability insurance.Europe's one-time \"nuclear poster child\" is about to lose its pro-nuke Sarkozy to the Socialist Francois Hollande, who may or may not begin shutting the nation's reactors. But the French public has moved strongly toward renewables and probably won't tolerate new ones.Led by Germany, Europe's nuclear future is past. Proposed reactors in Great Britain and elsewhere are stalled. Bulgaria has cancelled two.Of Japan's 54 licensed post-Fukushima units, just one now operates -- and may soon shut. Tokyo wants to open more, but grassroots resistance is fierce. Ditto India, where massive demonstrations and hunger strikes have erupted against the Koodankulam project.South Korea and Taiwan still want new reactors. Korea may sell at least one to the United Arab Emirates. The Saudis and Jordan may soon start construction.But the global key now rests with China. Despite its campaign to corner the world market in wind and solar hardware, China has been poised to bring on line close to 100 reactors. It may claim the largest number of new proposals -- more than 30.But Fukushima prompted a suspension of new approvals and a move toward a national energy plan. A final rejection could blow the floor out of any global nuclear future.With a rising tide of grassroots environmentalism in China, any No Nukes movement there must be embraced worldwide. In its hands may lie the future of the Earth.Reactor backers desperately hype potential orders from China and India, and from small nations like Turkey and Taiwan. But who will protect us -- or even tell us -- when they explode?This weekend the Sierra Club will host a packed national gathering of grassroots No Nukers to plan the U.S. nuclear industry's final demise. There's much to celebrate. The campaign for a green-powered Earth has become one of her most successful non-violent social movements.But the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima are far from over. The radiation they still spew threatens our survival.Without a truly global Solartopian uprising, the ultimate China Syndrome may yet come in China... and spread worldwide.In economy and ecology, we have no future without finally cleansing from every corner on Earth the lingering plague of the failed atom.Harvey Wasserman's SOLARTOPIA!

Again, I was very relaxed. I still had my book and the delay was still out of my control. Yes, it was nearly 1 in the morning Chicago time, but I had slept on the plane.We waited about 20 minutes and then finally pulled into the gate. I grabbed my luggage and rushed to get a taxi. As I saw the line of over 400 people waiting for taxis and the slow trickle of taxis arriving, it struck me that it might take longer to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel than it took to fly from New York to Chicago.I took my place at the end of the line. Five minutes passed and line moved slightly. Five more minutes passed and the line trudged forward. Everyone started grumbling about how long it was going to take to get a taxi. One of the taxi dispatchers walked down the line from the front to the back. When she reached me I heard her clearly ask everyone in line, \"Anyone going downtown who's willing to share a ride?\" I immediately stepped out of line. She marched me and the other two people who were willing to share a cab to the front of the line past the hundreds who had declined the offer.The conversation on the ride was fascinating as the three passengers and driver tried to settle on a reason for why almost no one on line would share the ride.\"Maybe most people weren't going downtown? Sharing a ride wasn't possible for them.\" The driver quickly jumped in stating that he is certain that the majority of people on line, with their business suits and briefcases, were going downtown.\"Maybe they thought it would be faster to stand on that 400-person line?\" Ok, we laughed at that one.One of the other passengers stated, \"Americans simply don't know how to share, never did, never will. As if they didn't notice that they just shared a plane ride with a hundred strangers.\"The driver chimed in again: \"You three sharing a ride is good for me. I earn more money for driving downtown. It's better for the environment. It's better for you three since you arrive at your hotel sooner and you spend much less money on a taxi.... but the people who wanted their own taxi are probably spending someone else's money so you don't care.\"That last sentence resonated. Most of the people standing on line were traveling for business. Most were probably going to be reimbursed by their company or organization. Saving money may not have been a high priority for them since it wasn't their money they were spending.For me, the deciding factor was time. There were delays in my trip that I couldn't control but I certainly could save time by sharing the taxi ride. Time in life is critically important. After all, your wealth can go up or your wealth can go down, but time in life only goes one direction.I woke up this morning still wondering what was motivating the hundreds of people to prefer to stand on a taxi line at one in the morning rather than share a taxi.

The dialogue, held in Washington, D.C., explored how businesses can accelerate the development and adoption of green technology and how the United States and India are at the forefront of collaboration to promote clean energy.U.S. leaders present included Yale's president, Dr. Richard C. Levin, the Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan B. Poneman, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Dr. John P. Holden, and Senator Tom Udall (D-NM). Leaders from India included the president of TERI-North America, Dr. Rajendra K.

Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman characterized the U.S.-India relationship on energy and environmental issues as a vibrant and even breathtaking one. The two countries share values and interests, he noted. They also happen to be the first and third largest emitters of carbon dioxide; therefore, they have a common responsibility to serve as stewards for the planet.  Yale has played a key role in mobilizing intellectual capital at universities in the service of exploring alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, biomass, shale gas, and nuclear, as well as cleaner and more efficient methods of extracting and using energy -- from carbon capture and sequestration to a smarter grid.TERI in Delhi is, meanwhile, challenging assumptions about what kind of progress is possible in the developing world through its Lighting a Billion Lives campaign, helping rural Indians gain access to clean and reliable energy. 1.4 billion people, 400 million of whom live in India, lack access to electricity and rely on older technologies, like kerosene lamps, to cook, work, and study when night falls. These lamps are not only inefficient, they also produce smoke that contributes to indoor air pollution and present a fire hazard.TERI is working to enable Indians to use lamps powered by solar energy. These lamps are safer, more reliable, and more efficient. The introduction of this new technology has also helped more women to become entrepreneurs by enabling them to work at solar lamp-charging stations and rent solar lamps out.Academia and NGOs are, clearly, doing their part. But both the private sector and the government also have critical and indispensable roles to play in the development of clean energy technology. The private sector has the knowledge needed to develop the most appropriate technology for addressing a given problem. It is also driven by the profit motive, which helps ensure that new technology is as efficient as possible. The government, on the other hand, must fund basic research, which is critical to innovation, but which the private sector chronically under-invests in because gains from basic research generally cannot be captured by one firm and instead are distributed industry-wide. The government should also design the policy environment with an eye towards promoting innovation. If policy space places a premium on energy efficiency, innovation will develop in a direction that favors clean technology.There are many areas in which government needs to step up to the plate. There are still barriers to sharing technology and ideas, including the difficulty that foreign scientists can have in securing visas as well as inadequate funding for basic research. Government should also create a level playing field for all types of energy: alternative energy sources must be priced so that they can compete with traditionally cheaper fossil fuels.It is impressive and inspiring to see the two largest democracies in the world take the lead on clean energy innovation and climate change science. Hopefully, the U.S.-India partnership can serve as the cornerstone of a coordinated, global effort to address the most important energy and environmental challenges that the world faces."}, {"title": "TransCanada Applies For Keystone XL Pipeline Permit", "text": "* TransCanada submits Presidential permit application* Company to outline new Nebraska route later* Pipeline was put on hold in JanuaryBy Jeffrey JonesCALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp is taking its second shot at asking Washington to approve the contentious Keystone XL oil pipeline, betting that a new route through Nebraska and post-U.S. election time frame for a decision will push the project forward.The reapplication to the U.S. State Department on Friday comes after Canada's largest pipeline company carved the proposal into two parts in hopes of kickstarting the project.U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the full $7.6 billion project early in this election year as concerns spread about the proposed northern portion of the route near an aquifer in Nebraska. Obama has expressed support for the southern portion.TransCanada has been negotiating with Nebraska state officials over a new route and hopes to have U.S. State Department approval for the northern part of the line early next year with the aim of putting it in service by the end of 2014 or early 2015. That portion would cost $5.3 billion.The company pointed out that 10,000 pages of study from the first review concluded Keystone XL would have minimal impact on the environment, so the application need not be bogged down again.\"Certainly the message we've heard coming out of the State Department and out of the White House is that they fully expect to use as much of the pre-existing record from the previous application as possible,\" Alex Pourbaix, president of TransCanada's pipeline division, told Reuters.\"When we look at that we think that the lion's share of that information remains current and relevant and provides all of the analysis that the State Department would require to make their decision.\"The move angered environmentalists, who had claimed the last rejection as a victory in a battle against what they say are oil spill risks and rising greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands development. Last year they staged noisy protests against the project in Washington and elsewhere, leading to some arrests.TransCanada and its supporters say Keystone XL would be key to cutting U.S. dependence on imported oil from unfriendly sources and will create thousands of jobs.The State Department, which reviews the application because it crosses the international border, noted that the earliest it could make a decision is early 2013.PRESIDENTIAL PIPELINE POLITICSThat pushes it past the November election. U.S. Republicans were highly critical of Obama's refusal to approve the project, saying he was thumbing his nose at a crucial job-creation opportunity and a way to keep gasoline prices in check.\"This project has been caught up in presidential politics long enough, it's time to get to work,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.Rebublican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney backed the pipeline on Friday in a campaign stop.\"By the way, that pipeline from Canada? We'll build it if I have to build it myself,\" he told supporters in a suburb of Pittsburgh.For the Obama administration, the development has been politically troublesome, pitting environmentalists opposed to increased fossil fuel use and pipelines through sensitive areas against unions and other Democrats who say it will create badly needed jobs in a shaky economy.In January, he rejected the project under a deadline imposed by Congress, saying more time was needed to review the proposed route which raised objections in Nebraska due to its course across the Ogallala aquifer, a major water source.Pourbaix said he believes the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality will be able to decide on a new route that skirts environmentally sensitive areas by September or October.The overall 830,000 barrel a day project is aimed at moving crude derived from the Alberta oil sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which face declining volumes of oil from traditional suppliers, including Mexico and Venezuela. It would also transport growing supplies from North Dakota's booming Bakken shale oil fields.Canadian oil producers and Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government have lobbied hard for the 1,661 mile (2,673 km) pipeline, as part of a series of initiatives to tap new markets to get better returns for burgeoning production from the tar sands. Most of that now flows to the oversupplied U.S. Midwest.Joe Oliver, Canada's natural resources minister, said he believes there is now a greater likelihood of Washington's approval now that the Nebraska issues are being dealt with.Bill McKibben, an environmental activist who was one of the leaders of last year's pipeline protests, said a new route through Nebraska will not solve larger environmental problems such as rising carbon emissions from tar sands development.\"There are many reasons to be worried about this thing. The one that brought most people out into the streets was worries about our climatic future. Those remain,\" McKibben said.The $2.3 billion Gulf Coast portion will carry crude to Texas refineries from the glutted Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub. It does not require a presidential permit and Obama has said he will direct officials to quickly grant the necessary permits.TransCanada expects the approvals for that segment to allow construction to start by the end of the summer, which would mean the pipeline could be in service by mid- to late 2013, Pourbaix said."}, {"title": "Lancing the Greenie Myth of New Orleans", "text": "In the immediate political aftermath of the New Orleans Flood, conservative commentators fanned a myth that environmentalists blocked the Army Corps of Engineers' original plans for barrier structures and forced the federal agency to choose an alternate inferior design that could not protect the city from Hurricane Katrina's surge.No one lances the Greenie Myth so deftly as Robert Verchick, J.D., Gauthier-St. Martin Eminent Scholar of the Loyola University and recent winner of a Fulbright.In chapter nine of his most recent book, Facing Catastrophe: Environmental Action for a Post-Katrina World (Harvard University Press, 2010), now available in paperback, Verchick describes how the myth developed, and then exquisitely blasts the myth with the true story.Between 1970-75, the Army Corps issued a plan calling for massive sea gates for the coastal area east of the city -- the Rigolets and Chef Menteur Pass. A jazz photographer with a law degree, Luke Fontana accompanied by small group of conservation-minded fishermen filed suit against the Barrier Plan in 1977 over the Corps's cursory Environmental Impact Study (EIS). After three days of testimony, federal Judge Charles Schwartz said he had heard enough. He agreed with Fontana and temporarily prohibited the Barrier Plan implementation \"citing inadequacies in the ...EIS analysis of the surge barrier effects on lake salinity regimes and habitat....\"Today, Verchick writes, a proper EIS can be hundreds, even thousands of pages long, but in 1970, the corps's 4-page typewritten EIS and optimistic conclusion about the barrier's effect on sea life was \"based on an outdated study modeled around an obsolete version of the project.\" Eventually, the corps abandoned the barrier project and elected to raise the height of the city's canal walls instead.Less than two weeks after the 2005 flood -- when over 100,000 families were trying to figure out where to live, where to work and where to send their kids to school -- the barrier plan sprang to life in a front-page story in the Los Angeles Times, \"A Barrier That Could Have Been.\" The story claimed the superior plan was \"derailed\" by an environmental lawsuit. A right-winger blogger branded the levee failures a \"Green Genocide.\"But in reality, Judge Schwartz had simply asked the corps to return with a better EIS.This judge was not, as the Los Angeles Times reported, stopping the Corps in its tracks. He was saying, 'Y'all come back.'But five years later, having never completed a revised EIS, the Corps decided against the barrier option and concluded that higher levees providing hurricane protection was less costly, less damaging to the environment, and more acceptable.In 2005, the Army Corps' levees and floodwalls breached in 53 different locations within a space of a few hours. And Verchick concludes that \"it is unfair and destructive to cast responsibility for the failure of the New Orleans levee system on this small band of activists and a popular environmental law.\"Furthermore, Verchick reveals, there is another \"broken link in the causal chain,\" namely that Corps officials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office a month after the storm \"believe that flooding would have been worse if the original (barrier) plan had been adopted\" because of the direction of Katrina's surge.Levees.org has long believed that early myths and misinformation in the weeks and months after the New Orleans Flood were harmful because they alienated American citizens and may have prejudiced members of Congress.So we highly recommend Facing Catastrophe which is now available in paperback and on kindle. Furthermore, while the book is required reading at several law schools and graduate programs in disaster studies, it is also remarkably accessible to lay people.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674047914For the full book review, click here.Today, we are pleased to announce a new Myth Buster: Had environmental concerns in the 1970s been ignored, the flooding in New Orleans during Katrina would likely have been worse.Click here for more Myth Busters by Levees.org."}, {"title": "Wyoming Mineral Leases: Activists File Greenhouse Gas Emissions Lawsuit", "text": "By Laura ZuckermanSALMON, Idaho, May 3 (Reuters) - Citing global warming, environmental groups are asking a federal judge to call a halt in Wyoming to one of the largest coal-mining plans ever approved by the U.S. government.In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the Sierra Club and WildEarth Guardians said the federal Bureau of Land Management failed to consider the impact of greenhouse gases that will be emitted when coal from four government mineral leases in Wyoming is burned in power plants across the nation and in Asia.The leases contain roughly 2 billion tons of coal in the Wyoming portion of the Powder River Basin, a geologic region in northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana that produces about 40 percent of the country's coal.Environmentalists are arguing that the BLM broke federal laws and agency rules by neglecting to analyze fully the global impact from the release of carbon dioxide and other pollutants by power plants, mostly in the Midwest, that will burn coal from the four leases.They say those leases represent one of the largest coal-mining plans ever sanctioned by the federal government.The groups want a federal judge to suspend the government's plan to lease and mine coal from the tracts at least until the BLM completes a supplemental analysis on the environmental impacts.\"The BLM itself has estimated that for every one ton of Powder River Basin coal burned, 1,659 metric tons of carbon dioxide are released,\" said Connie Wilbert, head of the Wyoming chapter of the Sierra Club. \"We have to start addressing this problem now, we can't keep doing business as usual.\"Beverly Gorny, spokeswoman for the BLM office in Cheyenne, Wyoming, said she could not comment on the litigation.The agency has already sold one of the four leases to Arch Coal Inc, one of the world's top coal producers and owner of Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming, the largest U.S. coal mine and the largest coal-mining complex in the world, according to the company's website.Officials at the St. Louis-based company did not respond to requests for comment.Another of the leases - in the vicinity of the North Antelope Rochelle Mine owned by Peabody Energy - is slated to be sold on May 17. The remaining two leases have not yet been scheduled for sale, Gorny said.Peabody Energy, headquartered in St. Louis, did not respond to requests for comment.The Powder River Basin is prized for \"clean\" coal. It contains much less sulfur - a contributor to acid rain - than coal produced in the eastern United States. It also produces more heat, or energy, when burned and creates less fly ash, according to the Wyoming State Geological Survey."}, {"title": "What Green Consumer Polls Should Really Be Asking", "text": "Ever since the resurgence of environmentalism in 1990, consumer polls have attempted to measure awareness, attitudes and behaviors towards environmental issues and products. Poll after poll has found that consumers claim to be concerned about the issues, they report high levels of green product purchase, and even claim willingness to pay a premium for greener products and packages.But empirical evidence doesn't seem to jibe with the research. In some markets, green products barely eke out 3 percent share, in contrast to the near majorities of consumers who express to pollsters interest in all things green. And despite consumer pronouncements otherwise, premium-priced green brands often gather dust on shelves.What can explain the gap between the polls and actual in-market performance? Are consumers lying to pollsters in an attempt to look virtuous? Is the spirit willing but the pocketbook weak? Or is it possible that we ourselves need to change the way we view the green consumer market and ask different questions? I suspect the latter.What is \"green\" exactly?  One of the biggest challenges in defining \"green\", whether it be consumers, products or ads, is that \"green,\" like the planet itself, encompasses everything -- air, water, biological life, chemicals, energy, you name it.When it comes to zeroing in on \"green\" products, what constitutes \"green\" can run the entire gamut of one or more attributes spanning a product's lifecycle starting with raw materials (\"sustainably harvested,\" \"organic\" and \"recycled\"), right through to disposal (\"compostable,\" \"recyclable,\") and everything in between.And most consumers can be said to be \"green\" in some way. For instance, NMI's 2011 US LOHAS Consumer Trends poll found that 83 percent -- an overwhelming majority of consumers -- said they identified with green at some level. (Who wouldn't be for green?).So when majorities of consumers say they are concerned about environmental issues and express interest in buying green products and recycling their newspapers and bottles, chances are they are telling the truth.Consumers may think they are actually greener than we give them credit for.  Is it possible that polls may overstate green consumer purchasing and behavior  because consumers think that some of the conventional products they buy are actually green?Consider the language on the back of bottle of Tide. Every bottle of Tide, and many other big laundry detergent brands, too, now carries a recycling label and these messages: \"Bottle made from 25 percent or more post-consumer plastic,\" \"Contains no phosphates,\" \"Ingredients include biodegradable surfactants (anionic and nonionic) and enzymes.\" This all sounds pretty green to me!Even without such language, is it possible that consumers may believe that trusted brands from reputable companies are \"green\" -- or that the government is watching out?Do greener products need to scream green via eco-logos and images of planets, babies and daisies to merit a check mark in the \"green\" column? Consider, too that white vinegar and baking soda have long been touted as green cleaning aids but don't sport eco-logos of any stripe.There may not even be such as thing as \"green\" marketing.  When the FTC Green Guides are issued in revised form (likely this year), what are referred to as \"generalized environmental claims\" will most likely be discouraged. So \"green\" marketing is really an umbrella term for educating consumers about the various specific environmental benefits and attributes of one's products or company. Babies, planets and daisies are quickly disappearing from the vernacular and in their place are claims for particular environmental attributes.So the answers to the $64,000 dollar questions of green marketing: Who is the \"green\" consumer and will she pay a premium for green? may be that all  (or, okay, most) consumers are green consumers since most consumers may think they are already buying green products, however they may define them. And the extent to which they are willing to pay a premium may be no different for \"green\" than other products and that is: Do they provide value?The Path Forward What we seem to be dealing with, then, is a question of semantics, and the challenge of knowing which questions to ask to help us understand green market opportunities. \"Green\" is a cozy, easy to remember term, but it may not be so useful in communicating with consumers who likely have their own interpretations of \"green\" expressed throughout their day-to-day lives. And misleading polls results don't help to build credibility for investment among skeptical businesspeople who for the past 20-plus years have been hearing that consumers \"don't care\" and \"won't pay a premium.\"To those willing to take a shot at rebuilding interest and credibility in all things \"green\", remember three important things: 1) Most consumers want to do the right thing. They want clean air and clean water, healthful food to eat, litter-free parks and beaches to play in, and energy to run their lives; 2) Whether it be keeping their bathtub clean, saving for retirement, driving the speed limit or eating healthily, all consumers tend to overstate virtuous behavior to pollsters. (More than we would like, they report the person they aspire to be, or who they are just part of the time.) And; 3) just like for all products, most consumers will only pay a premium when products demonstrate genuine added value.Although it might take a little doing, most consumers have the wherewithal to understand the building blocks of \"green\", e.g., \"recycled,\" \"recyclable\" and \"biodegradable.\" Happily, businesses have the wherewithal to address consumers' needs and to do it sustainably. Their motivations: a competitive advantage, profits, brand loyalty, motivated employees, the ability to innovate, and the promise of a business that will be sustained over time.My book, The New Rules of Green Marketing includes detailed strategies and tools for businesses looking to positively address consumers' environmental consciousness without fear of backlash. On the top of the list is the need for customized research to understand one's own consumers' attitudes and awareness of specific environmental attributes, including carefully segmenting the marketplace, and marketing one's products accordingly.An expert consultant to industry and government on strategic green marketing, Ottman is a sought-after speaker, and author of four books on green marketing. Her latest book is The New Rules of Green Marketing: Strategies, Tools, and Inspiration for Sustainable Branding (Berrett-Koehler, 2011).

Copyright \u00a9 2012 by Philip Warburg. Reprinted by permission of Beacon Press, Boston.Beyond the immediate financial gains, American wind farm hosts enjoy contributing to an exit strategy from fossil fuels. In the Flint Hills of Kansas, rancher Pete Ferrell angered neighbors when he allowed turbines on his land. They preferred looking at pristine prairie; he chose to invest in a sustainable, locally abundant energy resource.It's no small wonder that Pete Ferrell has incurred the wrath of many ranchers and conservationists in the Flint Hills of Kansas. They are hell-bent on stonewalling any wind development in this vast stretch of tallgrass prairie. He sees wind power as a promising and profitable extension of the cattle-raising and oil-drilling that already make this a working landscape.Pete's great-grandfather began assembling property for the family's ranch in 1888, with profits he earned from a dry goods store in Wichita. The family holdings grew to 7,000 acres, but Pete inherited only a third of it. To keep the ranch intact, he bought back some of the acreage from his aunts and uncles. This left him carrying a crushing debt. \"If you inherit land and it's debt-free, you can probably make a decent living, but paying interest and principal on land?\" He tells me that the last time farmers and ranchers could break even on land that they had to purchase was in the 1920s.As he struggled to amass enough capital to purchase the remainder of the ranch, Pete eventually realized the toll this was taking on his health and well-being. \"I was looking at a situation where I was going to join the Old Dead Ranchers Club, which is a group of great people who work 24/7, 365 days a year, until they fall over dead. 'Congratulations, you're a member,'\" he says with a sardonic grin. We are sitting in his adobe-style ranch office, just across a rutted driveway from the hollow where he lives in a simple, unpainted wood cabin with his two dogs. The divorce from his wife some years ago, I can guess, only added to his financial stresses.Pete Ferrell, Flint Hills rancher and wind farm host. Photo by author.It was in the late 1980s that Pete became interested in the holistic management principles that economist Stan Parsons and ecologist Allan Savory had begun advancing through their teachings. Attending one of their training sessions, Pete was asked to catalog the full array of values on his property. He started underground with the oil resources that had yielded a handsome income for his mother over many years. (Even today, a half-dozen of those wells remain visible on his land, although Pete says they're drying up.) Then, rising to the surface, he reflected on the soils, the grass, the sun, and the water that make it possible to graze his cattle. Finally he was asked to delete those activities that are unsustainable or are not ecologically sound.Wind was on the short list of what was left. Half-obscuring the windows in Pete's office today are two maps showing the distribution of wind resources in Kansas. Even without those maps, he knew that the winds in his section of the Flint Hills were exceptional. Today he hosts about half the turbines in the Elk River Wind Farm, a project that generates enough power to meet the needs of about forty thousand Kansas and Missouri households.Ferrell ranch, Beaumont, Kansas. Photo by author.Along with stabilizing his ranch's finances, Pete firmly believes he is helping wean America off energy resources that, in the greater scheme of history, are moments away from running out. To make this point, he unfurls a few dozen feet of computer paper, starting on the floor of his office, continuing out into the foyer, and then reaching across the full length of a second room where his ranch manager keeps track of cattle shipments. This long paper trail, ragged from repeated use, likens the past 750 million years of history to a single calendar year. Pete takes me to the final few perforated sheets and points to December 11, the date when mammals show up. Homo erectus appears the day after Christmas; Homo sapiens on December 30. At three seconds to midnight on December 31, we begin to burn petroleum, and by three seconds into the New Year, Pete tells me it will all be gone. \"We have a whole civilization built on something that's gonna run out,\" he told a roomful of fellow Grinnell alumni when he lectured on this topic at a recent college reunion.Rose Bacon is among the Flint Hills ranchers who take a cynical view of Pete's efforts. \"People don't believe he's a wind conqueror; they believe it was for the money... I feel bad that he had to make that choice because he's lost so much.\" I ask what he has lost, and she tells me: \"Friendships and respect.\"Pete, for his part, is now working on a project that may bring as much as 800 megawatts of wind power to cultivated farmland in southwestern Kansas -- more than five times as much as the Elk River Wind Farm. Luckily for Pete and others in the Kansas wind trade, there are ample opportunities to tap the state's enormous wind potential outside the Flint Hills."}, {"title": "Bella The Llama Gets Prosthetic Leg With Cheetah-Print Pattern, Escapes Euthanasia In California (VIDEO)", "text": "Bella the llama has a new fashion accessory: a cheetah-print prosthesis.After stepping in a gopher hole and breaking her back leg about two years ago, the animal was forced to have the leg amputated after complications that continued to result in infection, according to the Sacramento Bee.But life on three legs proved to be difficult, and Bella eventually stopped trying to move around at her Newcastle, Calif., home.Facing imminent euthanasia, Bella received help from Michael Carlson of the Hanger Clinic, the  same company that built a prosthetic tail for Winter the dolphin, the Bee reports.Today, the llama looks forward to frolicking with her new leg, which is outfitted with a cheetah-print pattern. And she's even developed a loving relationship with the team that gave her a second chance at life.\"When she sees me in the morning, if I do not come out with her leg, she just keeps staring at me,\" Trish Brandt-Robuck told FOX 40 in an on-camera interview. \"As soon as I put it on, she's up, ears up. I mean, she's a happy camper.\"While Bella is thought to be the first llama to sport a the prosthetic leg, rehabilitation efforts have given countless animals a new lease on life over the years.Like the llama, Motala the elephant had her leg amputated after unsuccessful attempts to save the limb.

Her own 3-day-old daughter died of kidney failure in 1999, and a neighbor had a baby die of the same uncommon birth defect.Editor's Note: This story contains explicit language.\"I started seeing children with mouth covers, mothers with scarves wrapped around their heads to cover their baldness, due to chemotherapy,\" she told Grist in an interview, explaining what inspired her to co-found Mothers of Ituzaing\u00f3. The efforts of those half-dozen mothers, who began going from door to door collecting information on health problems in their community, led to the first epidemiological study that showed cancer rates in Gatica's hometown of Ituzaing\u00f3 were 41 times the national average, with high rates of birth defects and infant mortality as well.Within a few years of the study's publication, and as her advocacy work gave her a higher profile, Gatica began to receive death threats, culminating in an incident in late 2007.\"I had just come back from the corner store, and I never lock my door,\" she told HuffPost through a translator. \"I always just come and go in our neighborhood, and I came in and he followed behind me and put the gun against my head in my kitchen and said that I needed to 'stop fucking with the soy.'\"Gatica said she held perfectly still and complied with the gunman's wishes. \"He made me sit down in a chair,\" she said. \"He said not to leave, and so I didn't leave. I waited until he drove away and then I went to the police.\"Despite her careful description, the police were unable to identify the man, and Gatica continued to receive threatening phone calls.\"I was living with my heart in my mouth,\" said Gatica, after an anonymous caller told her she would soon have \"two children instead of three.\" She asked the police to tap her line and trace the callers, and while they told her they had opened an investigation, she's been told the file is secret.Other threats, she said, came from neighbors who were angry that the value of their homes had gone down because of her work.\"In one case a woman got on the bus and was yelling at me, saying I had lowered the price of her house and that who was I to be telling people if they were sick or not, if my neighbors were sick or not? She was insulting me personally to the point I got off the bus and walked to my office, and when I got there, I found out where she lived and called the police to get a restraining order. It turned out later that that woman had cancer,\" Gatica said, \"so she was likely having some kind of an emotional reaction.\"Gatica said that same woman had threatened her youngest daughter, now 14 years old, when her daughter was riding her bicycle in the neighborhood, and that her other children, a 19-year-old daughter and a 23-year-old son, had also been targeted at school.Farmers and others in Argentina use weedkiller primarily on genetically modified Roundup Ready soy, which covers nearly 50 million acres, or half of the country's cultivated land area. In 2009 farmers sprayed that acreage with an estimated 200 million liters of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and other herbicides used around the globe, which critics have argued for decades poses a serious threat to public health.The Argentine government helped pull the country out of a recession in the 1990s, in part by promoting genetically modified soy. Though it was something of a miracle for local farmers at the time, residents in areas nearby the crops began a few years later to report health problems, including high rates of birth defects and cancers, as well as the losses of crops and livestock.Gatica said that after she began reporting those problems on local radio in 2006, she was hassled by the local police. \"At one point they actually knocked on my door and made me come out on the street,\" she said through a translator. \"The street was filled with maybe 30 patrol men asking her to stop 'lying' about her neighborhood.\"\"It was very intimidating,\" she told HuffPost, but she stood by her statements. The police actually took her to the house of a local soy farmer who had been spraying Roundup and asked the farmer to tell Sofia that he hadn't hired them. Then, she said, \"they left me there in the farm and I had to walk back and the farmer was letting his dogs out and they were barking at us.\"Still, she says, she doesn't blame the police for these actions. \"I feel like they were following orders,\" she said.While Monsanto avers that glyphosate poses no risk to humans, the work of activists like Gatica and Argentine government scientist, Andres Carrasco, suggest a different story. Carrasco conducted a study in 2009, \"Glyphosate-Based Herbicides Produce Teratogenic Effects on Vertebrates by Impairing Retinoic Acid Signaling,\" which found that glyphosate causes malformations in frog and chicken embryos at doses far lower than those used in agricultural spraying. It also found that malformations caused in frog and chicken embryos by Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate were similar to human birth defects found in genetically modified soy-producing regions.\"The findings in the lab are compatible with malformations observed in humans exposed to glyphosate during pregnancy,\" wrote Carrasco, director of the Laboratory of Molecular Embryology at the University of Buenos Aires. \"I suspect the toxicity classification of glyphosate is too low.\u201d\u201cIn some cases this can be a powerful poison,\" he concluded.Another pesticide Gatica has targeted of late, endosulfan, has been banned in 80 countries, and in May of 2011 the Stockholm Convention, an international treaty, added the pesticide to their list of persistent pollutants to be eliminated. Her group's press conferences, demonstrations and data-gathering efforts have yielded some success in recent months, and a countrywide ban of endosulfan will go into effect in July 2013.Gatica has also succeeded in passing a municipal ordinance prohibiting aerial spraying 2,500 meters from people's homes, and in 2012 she was awarded the distinguished Goldman Prize for environmentalists in South and Central America. She's currently working on a campaign to create buffer zones for agrochemicals throughout all of Argentina, protecting residential areas and waterways.Her next project, she says, will be pushing for a countrywide ban on glyphosate.Gatica notes that she's made a lot of enemies, even if she isn't sure who they are.\"I don't know if it's the soy farmers, or the soy industry, or the government because they're all so linked -- and they're all angry about the work I've been doing.\""}, {"title": "How Science Connects the Dots: Global Warming Didn't Stop in 1998", "text": "During a meeting in 2008, a U.S. senator told me about the many claims that global warming stopped in 1998, suggesting that we really don't need to be concerned about future warming and that climate scientists were misleading the public.Google the phrase \"global warming stopped in 1998\" for yourself, and you'll see tens of thousands of results. A quick reading of these \"results\" finds many agreeing with the senator's sources, with many others debunking this claim. So what were the senator and I to do? The variability of nature often fools us. Everyday experiences with weather -- an unexpectedly warm winter, or a cooler-than-anticipated summer -- get many folks confused. But science has a way of connecting the dots of temperature over time, to find out what nature is really telling us.When the senator quizzed me, the hottest year in thermometer records was either 1998 or 2005, depending on which compilation you chose. A huge El Ni\u00f1o had cranked up the 1998 temperature. But, if 1998 was the hottest or second-hottest year through 2007, didn't that in fact show that global warming had stopped, just as some people argued?To find out what's really going on, the analysis is best done with extensions of statistical tests developed by a mathematician working for the Guinness brewery more than a century ago. (But that's a tale for another day.) Let me walk you through some dates in the past 50 years of Earth's climate history, keying them to a few personal milestones, and with my tongue somewhat in cheek. Do be aware that Latin for wandering about is \"errare\", the root of our word, error.I was born in 1957. Here's what Earth's temperature was doing back when I had more hair, but less gray. The red line in all these graphics is the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Study's history of the planet's surface temperature, connecting the global average temperature for each year. The black line is a regression -- the best straight line through those dates and temperatures. And as you can clearly see from the downward slope of that black line, I was born at the start of a cooling period.In 1980, I was lucky to marry a wonderful woman, to whom I'm still happily married. And you can clearly see that during the first years of our life together the temperature did drop a little. How lucky I was and still am to have her love to keep me warm!In 1988, I got this great job here at Penn State, and once again you can see there's a very slight downward trend in the years after we first moved to State College.And when, nine years later in 1997, we decided to take our kids out West to show them some of the great National Parks, it was still getting colder.In 2002, they actually named a glacier in Antarctica (brrrrr!) after me and the cooling was really accelerating, as you can see from that short, sharp downward line.And in 2005, when our daughter Janet came to Penn State as a student, it was cooling very slightly.So from 1957 through 2005, if you stop and look at these small fragments of my life, you see cooling trends.But wait: suppose you actually connect all the dots, from 1957 through 2010, what do you see?Like a photomosaic, the big picture is rather different from the little ones. (I did warn you I would have my tongue in cheek, and might be leading you into errors!)You might imagine a person walking a dog. If you watch the dog, darting about, sniffing here and there, you might initially be fooled about which way they're going around the block. That's the red line: weather bounces around from year to year, and the extra El Ni\u00f1o warmth in 1998 was just the dog zipping after a squirrel. But if you watch the person -- the thick blue line -- you can see there's a clear direction to the walk through time.The mathematician-turned-brewer figured out a century ago how to let the dog's motion tell you how long you must watch to learn which way the person is going. None of the thin black lines is long enough -- the mathematician would say that the short cooling trends are not significant -- but the thick blue line is long enough and shows significant warming. Yet despite a century of warnings, some people still seem to fool themselves, or others, by jumping to conclusions without watching long enough, whether in casinos, or on Wall Street, or even on the Opinion page of the Wall Street Journal.Bottom line: Has it actually been getting warmer? Yes. Is there any serious doubt about this? No, there really isn't, especially because we also see warming if we work with the data from NOAA, or from the Berkeley group that reanalyzed the temperature \"dots,\" or from satellites, or from many other sources.We can get the story straight if we connect the dots, and let the data -- not ideology or delusion -- tell us what's really going on."}, {"title": "Sustainable Seafood: Which Retailers Topped the List? (INFOGRAPHIC)", "text": "Finding sustainable seafood has long been a challenge for environmentalists and foodies alike. Recently, however, supermarkets and food stores have stepped up their efforts to reconcile that dilemma.Greenpeace has released the results of its annual Carting Away the Oceans report, which evaluates retailers on the sustainability of their seafood.Greenpeace has conducted the study in each of the last five years, and no retailer had ever achieved a \"green\" rating. Until now.This year, Safeway and Whole Foods topped the list, with a \"green\" score of 7.1 and 7.0 out of 10, respectively, followed by Wegmans, Harris Teeter and Target.The stores were graded on a number of factors, including the sale of overfished species such as Chilean sea bass, hoki, orange roughy and shark.The retailers were also scored based on the degree to which their fishing methods were destructive to habitat and the environment, as well as on their conservation initiatives, transparency and internal policies.Although some supermarkets received the incriminating \"fail\" rating, the good news is that the overall performance of the industry has improved significantly, the report shows.Despite this progress, problems persist. For instance, it is becoming increasingly difficult to trace fish back to their origin, making it hard to say for sure whether or not it is sustainable.According to the report, fraud and other illegal activity are also prevalent in the global seafood market -- even in the U.S. According to Greenpeace, pirate vessels capture as much as 20 percent of the seafood caught globally.To make matters worse, a dismal 2 percent of imported seafood is inspected for safety at international borders, posing concerns not only for sustainability, but also human health.Is your seafood sustainable?

It was put on hold while BP negotiated with the private plaintiffs.Barbier's order came one day after he granted preliminary approval to BP's estimated $7.8 billion settlement to resolve economic, property and medical claims by 125,000 individuals and businesses harmed by the spill. He set a Nov. 8 fairness hearing to consider objections before granting final approval.The April 20, 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 workers and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill from the ruptured Macondo well, in which BP held a 65 percent stake.Transocean owned the rig, and Halliburton provided cementing services. About 4.1 million barrels of oil were spilled and not cleaned up, the U.S. government has estimated.U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment. The offices of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange and Louisiana Attorney General James \"Buddy\" Caldwell had no immediate comment.Ellen Moskowitz, a BP spokeswoman, declined to comment.Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said that company has \"utmost confidence\" in its case. Halliburton spokeswoman Beverly Stafford did not respond to a request for comment.WILL TRIAL REALLY HAPPEN?BP had urged that a trial on remaining Gulf spill issues be delayed until after the Nov. 8 fairness hearing, to help ensure that any \"overlapping or parallel actions\" would not distract from administering the settlement with private plaintiffs.But the governments objected, saying such a delay would be unfair to residents and the broader public interest.BP previously took a roughly $37.2 billion charge for the spill. The London-based company's potential liability for violating the federal Clean Water Act alone could reach $17.6 billion if it were found to have acted with gross negligence.Other companies in the case are Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which owned 25 percent of the Macondo well; Cameron International Corp, which made a blowout preventer, and Schlumberger NV's M-I Swaco venture, which provided mud services. All have settled with BP.Mitsui & Co's MOEX USA unit, which owned 10 percent of the well, has also settled with BP, and in February agreed to pay $90 million to settle with the federal government.About 311 witnesses have been deposed and 90 million pages of documents have been produced in the case, court papers show.\"You wonder whether there will ever be a trial,\" said Tobias, the University of Richmond law professor. \"The farther we move past the actual event, it may complicate matters for all sides.

Today, in fact, multinational Edison announced it would close its decrepit Midwest Generation coal-fired plants in Chicago by September -- two years earlier than expected.Two months ago, Greenpeace also carried out a strategic action at Asheville's Progress Power coal-fired station, shifting non-coal-producing but huge coal-consuming North Carolina to the frontlines in the battle over dirty energy.Activists in North Carolina tagged Apple's logo on the coal trains today, calling out the tech company's increasingly coal-fired needs at it expanding Maiden, NC, datacenter.\"Duke is using datacenter expansion in North Carolina, like Apple's, to justify reinvesting in old coal-fired power plants and even worse, as an excuse to build new coal and nuclear plants. But if Apple demands renewable energy from Duke Energy to power its iCloud it could help transform both the IT sector's and North Carolina's energy economy,\" said Gabe Wisnieweski, Greenpeace USA Coal Campaign Director. \"Unfortunately, today Apple's iCloud uses whatever power Duke offers, and this dirty mix currently includes electricity from burning mountaintop removal coal. The climate and communities throughout Appalachia and North Carolina are paying the price for Apple and Duke's short-sighted decisions.\"According to regional activists, the Marshall Station burns coal stripmined from mountaintop removal operations in central Appalachia, a now well-documented process that has led to a humanitarian and health care crisis in McCoy's native Eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and neighboring southwest Virginia and eastern Tennessee."}, {"title": "Toxic Environmental Exposures Could Cause Reproductive Harm Across Generations, Study Suggests", "text": "The environment in which your great-great-grandmother lived, breathed, ate and drank might be responsible for health problems endured by you, your children, even your children's children.This is the disconcerting conclusion of a preliminary study, which experts say could help shift our understanding of disease -- reproductive disorders, in particular -- as well as how we perceive the consequences of everyday choices such as drinking out of a plastic water bottle.\"People can be cavalier with their own health,\" said Bruce Blumberg, a biologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study. \"But it's not just ourselves that are at risk. We're condemning our descendants to have increased risks, too.\"Scientists today are uncovering a host of potential new links between environmental exposures in the womb and health problems later in life, from bisphenol A (BPA) encouraging obesity to pesticides precipitating cognitive problems.The new research takes this notion a step farther -- or many generations into the future.Published on Thursday, the study exposed pregnant rats to high levels of prevalent plastics (BPA and phthalates), pesticides (vinclozolin, permethrin and DEET) or a notorious pollutant (dioxin), and then looked to see what influence the one-time exposures had on the ovaries of future generations. Of particular interest was a condition known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is itself implicated in a range of health problems including infertility, obesity and diabetes. PCOS has been on the rise over the last couple decades and now affects an estimated 8 to 18 percent of adult women.The researchers found each of the environmental toxins triggered ovarian disease in future generations. Interestingly, the effects in the third generation -- the first rats not to be directly exposed to the chemicals -- were more pronounced than in the offspring of the exposed rat.In addition to PCOS, the team also identified rats with the second-most common ovarian disease, also implicated in infertility: primary ovarian insufficiency.\"Ovarian disease, just like many diseases, are primarily thought to be due to genetic abnormalities,\" said Michael Skinner, a biologist at Washington State University and senior researcher on the study. \"This study suggests it is probably more of an environmentally induced phenomenon.\"Injections of the compounds into pregnant rats, in fact, did not alter the genes. Rather, the exposures changed how these inherited instructions for life were interpreted by the next generation.Previous studies of this so-called epigenetic effect have found that the defective programming can be repaired down the family line. John McCarrey, a biologist at the University of Texas, San Antonio, recently published a study in which he actually witnessed such corrections being made as one generation gave rise to the next. Different timing of the single exposures in the new study, he suggested, could explain why the mixed-up signaling wasn't fixed.\"These epigenetic defects are more serious than we thought. It's bad enough that these problems are going on in any individual,\" said McCarrey. \"Having them occur in descendants, that's pretty profound.\"Skinner's team is finding evidence of a similar phenomenon leading to kidney and prostate disease, breast cancer and obesity, among other health problems. However, he emphasized that none of the findings to date offer proof that the same permanent flaws would play out in humans. More studies are needed, including research into the levels of exposure necessary to cause harm.This issue of dosage may further confuse already complicated matters. Growing evidence questions an old assumption that the dose makes the poison. As The Huffington Post reported, even minute amounts of hormone-mimicking chemicals such as BPA appear to be more potent than larger quantities, and can scramble human hormones and cause a host of health problems.Skinner saw a similar phenomenon in his study: \"With the plastics, the lower doses actually gave us a more dramatic effect than the higher doses.\"Tracey Woodruff, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco, also noted that investigations into how toxic exposures affect a fetus have pointed to the significance of low doses.She went on to applaud the new study. \"There is so little known about the role of the environment on the female reproductive tract and these types of problems: fibroids, PCOS and endometriosis,\" said Woodruff, whose recent work describes what pregnant women can do to limit environmental exposures. \"This research adds data to something we suspect to be the case but for which there is little research.\"Some experts suggest that the new research provides new arguments for stricter regulations on certain chemicals.\"This raises the bar,\" added Blumberg. \"Industry likes to say that the risk isn't so big or the exposures are not so high. But, in fact, these exposures can have far-reaching effects. Unfortunately, regulators are having difficulty even coming to sensible conclusions on direct effects, let alone transgenerational ones.\""}, {"title": "Three Shocking Ways Packaged Foods Are Contaminated", "text": "Packaged foods acquire long shelf lives when their chemical properties are manipulated so that bacteria cannot grow. While this gives a perception of safety and sterility, it actually means that ingredients of any quality can be used and the food will never go bad. Low-quality ingredients can be left over from previous years, handled less carefully, and processed more quickly. These ingredients are cheap and make packaged food products highly profitable -- but they are full of contaminants.Typically, the only measure of contamination is bacterial count. Ingredients that go in fresh foods cannot have more than 25,000 viable cells of aerobic bacteria per gram. Packaged foods, however, can use ingredients with bacterial counts 40 times that or more. While these dormant germs can cause severe digestive discomfort and illness, there are many more dangerous food contaminants that go unnoticed.1. Processed Foods Carry Residues of Refining ChemicalsMost ingredients in packaged foods are not whole foods -- meaning that they contain only a part of the original food. Chemicals are often used to extract these partial-food ingredients, and these compounds leave residues in the food.Solvent chemicals are some of the harshest. The trustworthy-sounding preservative Vitamin E (Tocopherol) is produced from petroleum through the condensation of the toxins trimethylhydroquinone and isophytol. Soy-protein isolate is produced by bathing soybeans in a by-product of gasoline.The use of crude solvents to process food is not new and they can have serious health consequences. In the 1930s, more than 58,000 people lost major control of their limbs by using the medical tincture ginger jake. While the only listed ingredients were alcohol and ginger, the ginger was extracted using toxic tri-orthocresyl phosphate, present in up to 2 percent of the finished product.Impure ingredients are common. Many food additives, such as food dyes (covered in the previous post) can contain up to 13 percent impurities that develop from manufacturing. These include the carcinogens 4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, and dozens of other chemicals.2. Contaminants are Legally Allowed (Under Thresholds)Contrary to popular belief, food ingredients do not need to be clean; their contaminants just have to be below certain thresholds. Allowable substances in food include rat hairs, insects, mold, animal excrement, maggots, and more. Nearly a quarter of cows in a given farm can have udder infections that leak pus and blood into milk before it becomes unsellable. Even the fatal pesticide cyanide, the constituents of Agent Orange, and lead and arsenic have thresholds.These thresholds were not established until 1961 and, shockingly, the simple use of a chemical before that date is considered sufficient evidence that it is safe. Many allowable chemicals do not easily break down in the body, can accumulate to harmful concentrations, and their effects may appear only later in life. Because few of these substances occur naturally in food, knowledge of how they affect long-term health is very limited.The fact that threshold chemicals are not carefully monitored means that tainted ingredients don't easily raise flags. Nearly all of the world's supply of common additives like ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and wheat gluten are produced in China, which has had several recent food safety scares. Imports are regularly found to contain excessive or unexpected toxins, yet the rarity of testing means most goods pass through regardless.3. Manufacturing Processes Introduce GrimeThe contaminants harbored by food ingredients accumulate significantly when dozens of ingredients are combined to make food products. During the manufacturing process, new types of exposure emerge. Nearly all packaged food processing utilizes conveyer belts, and most belts are oiled to prevent food from sticking. This oil festers in equipment, harbors airborne and mechanical detritus, and ends up coating the food.The containers used for finished food products can have a huge impact as well. In the late 19th century, tin cans were sealed with lead solder leading to numerous deaths from lead poisoning. Today, aluminum cans are lined with epoxy resins that leak Bisphenol A into food and drinks. Canada has declared this chemical toxic and the FDA warns about exposing it to infants and children. Cans not lined with epoxy are used to pack acidic foods, which corrode and absorb the metal.The widespread use of plastic film is just as hazardous. Clear wrappers leach toxic phthalate esters into foods. The solvent-based matte varnish technique used overseas to print glossy wrappers transfers harsh chemicals to the food-contact side of the package when the film is stored in a roll. These beautiful, toxic packages are also the tools of food propaganda, which will be the subject of the next post on how packaging claims are recklessly misleading.Choose Single-Ingredient, Unprocessed, Perishable Foods (Produce)Between ingredients with high bacterial counts, residual chemical solvents, below-threshold toxins, manufacturing grime, and leaching packaging, the more processed and preserved foods are, the more contaminants start to add up. It's no coincidence that the most pervasive food allergens, like gluten, soy, and peanuts, also happen to be the cheapest, highest volume, and most processed foods. We are not suddenly becoming allergic to the 10,000-year-old staples of the human diet -- these foods are being overrun by contaminants.Eating any processed food is a gamble and is not your healthiest choice. Try to avoid eating packaged products as part of your daily routine. Instead, focus on eating mainly unprocessed, perishable foods like whole fruits and vegetables. If your food doesn't spoil, it's not fresh -- and chances are part of it is not even food."}, {"title": "Ishi Zangmo; 7 Year Old Himalayan Girl Helps to Protect the Planet", "text": "Enchanted Lands and Fables is a project that uses photos and short films to \"create awareness about some of the most endangered places and species on our planet.

His WesTech Solar Energy company in China and green city developments in Texas make the most of what Nature and efficient technologies can provide. His secret to success is stitching together people, technology, and ideas that might not normally interact, a process he calls \"1+1=11\". Like Wally, we can all find these force multipliers that leverage our assets beyond what many might think is possible -- but only if we look for them.In a previous blog, I mentioned one of these unique leavening agents for any business that spends money on advertising. EcoMedia created a clever program that takes a piece of ad dollars and invests it in community improvement projects, like solar panels on a school. The ad spend is the same, but the advertiser earns more positive impressions than they otherwise would have, when local newspapers and TV cover the story at the school, usually with smiling elected officials, parents, and students. As the Visa commercials say, that's priceless. EcoMedia has been so successful with this program, it has now expanded into wellness and education -- putting fresh money into community improvements and making more corporate halos a lot brighter.I saw another force multiplier last month in Brazil. The Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica announced a new net metering program modeled after California's successful Million Solar Roofs Initiative. Brazilians who install solar can now sell excess power to the grid, encouraging residents and businesses to become clean energy entrepreneurs. Today, Brazil has only about 1 percent as many solar installations as world leader Germany, but in the days following the announcement, this simple regulatory change inspired Braxenergy Desenvolvimento de Projetos de Energia to announce a new $50 million factory to make solar panels and Tecnometal Equipamentos announced a new $127 million facility to refine silicon and make other components for the panel market. Considering that the sun shines about 40 percent more in Brazil than Germany, every panel installed thanks to this new rule will be a force multiplier of its own.Closer to home, Phoenix-based Climatec is a force multiplier for large energy consumers. Unlike other contractors that perform energy audits and upgrade inefficient lighting, HVAC, and other systems, Climatec keeps a building \"tuned up\" by monitoring every energy use and performance from its high-tech headquarters often hundreds of miles away. Climatec is leveraging what we learned in California a few years ago when the state conducted an experiment in \"retro-commissioning\", essentially tuning up existing energy systems to operate as originally intended. We achieved an average of 18 percent energy savings from those tune-ups and learned the valuable lesson that, just like a car, you need to stay on top of those maintenance metrics to maintain peak performance and maximum saving of energy and money. Hospitals discovered that a small investment with a service like Climatec's pay even bigger dividends when they use the same monitoring system to manage fire and safety alarms and things like patient call and a/v systems, saving more money and improving customer service.Finding force multipliers for your company may not be obvious, but the thing these examples have in common is that they look at existing resources and ask, \"What more could we get out of what we already have or already spend?\" In June of this year, when many will focus on the Rio+20 \"earth summit\" to look for ways to make resources support a population of 7 billion and a rapidly growing middle class, finding your force multipliers can make a big difference in a more sustainable planet, economy, and business."}, {"title": "When Politics Becomes the Game", "text": "The NRDC Action Fund just released a book called Reckless about the House Republican majority that cast more than 200 votes against environmental safeguards last year. We aren't the only ones dismayed by the rise in GOP extremism. Republican leaders are too.This week, two esteemed conservative thinkers published a must-read op-ed  in  The Washington Post entitled, \"Let's Just Say It: The Republicans Are the Problem.\" Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote:The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by  conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.Mann and Ornstein are no lightweight centrists; they are the Republicans of the Republicans. If they see fault in their party's lurch to the far right, then you know things have gotten out of hand.Their piece made me realize just how many lawmakers seem to have forgotten why they serve. This is true of Republicans and Democrats alike, but the Republicans have cast themselves as the Party of No and made the defeat of the other side their primary goal. No one actually wins this kind of game. Instead, we end up with one big loser: the American people.Citizens send lawmakers to Washington to govern, not to play chicken. GOP's obstructionism may score points with their base, but it prevents Members from actually doing the work of government and administering the public's shared resources including roads, schools, clean air and water.Most of the public servants I know -- from Hill staffers to PTA presidents -- pursue their line of work because they want to make things better. Politicians who see victory in paralysis seem to have lost sight of that goal. They have become like the young boy who dreams of playing in the NBA, but gets so focused on the machinations of what it takes to make it that he loses his love of the game. I get it. Institutions like Congress can grind people down. But that's why we need leaders to stand up and offer inspiration -- not nay saying.The proliferation of negative ads is a symptom of this larger trend. Every political operative will tell you: campaigns use negative messages because they work. They lodge in people's minds and deliver votes. But here is what's different this year: PAC money. A new post by Paul Blumenthal includes some stunning statistics:\"While spending in support of one candidate nearly doubled from $19.14 million in 2008 to $36.59 million in 2012, spending against other candidates by independent groups exploded by 680 percent, from only $6.97 million in 2008 to $47.28 million in 2012.\"PACs are fueling the antagonism of an already polarized election cycle. When my two children are fighting, I don't step in and raise the heat by saying: \"Son, don't you remember how your sister stole your ball? Or \"Honey, he hit you first, didn't he?\" The PACs are the equivalent of a mother reminding her children why they hate each. If you stand in the way, you will never find resolution.Then again, some companies behind the PACs don't want resolution. Bloomberg News recently reported that  81 percent of anti-Obama ads focus on energy. Americans for Prosperity -- a group supported by oil companies -- spent $16.7 million between January and March on negative ads attacking Obama's energy policies.Oil companies benefit from a paralyzed political landscape. If Congress can't pass any laws, then companies don't have to clean up their pollution, invest in low-carbon technologies, or give up their generous tax breaks. The American people, however, are stuck with the dirty air, the extreme weather events, and the wind turbine factories moving to China.Candidates who make clean energy a central part of their platform can correct that imbalance. Clean energy is about job creation, competitive advantage, clean air, health families, and keeping our troops out of harm's way. It's about building things, not destroying them.That's what makes it a powerful antidote to current political antagonism. Lawmakers may debate the best way to promote clean energy or confront climate change, but the fact remains that expanding the clean economy will benefit America. Isn't that why lawmakers serve in the first place?"}, {"title": "Congress Revolts On Obama Plan That Would Ban 'Buy American'", "text": "WASHINGTON -- A group of 68 House Democrats and one Republican sent a letter to President Barack Obama on Thursday urging him to reconsider an element of the controversial free trade agreement currently being negotiated by the administration. If approved in its current form, the pact would effectively ban \"Buy American\" policies in government contracting.Although the deal, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has received relatively little media attention in the United States, it has sparked international friction among consumer groups and environmental activists who worry that terms demanded by the Obama administration will eliminate important public protections. Domestically, however, the deal's primary source of political tension is from a portion that could ban \"Buy American\" provisions -- a restriction that opponents emphasize would crimp U.S. jobs.Since the 1930s, the American government has offered preferential treatment to American producers in the awarding of federal contracts. If a domestic producer offers the government a more expensive bid than a foreign producer, it can still be awarded the contract under certain circumstances, but more recent free trade agreements have granted other nations the same negotiating status as domestic firms. The Obama administration is currently pushing to grant the several nations involved in the Trans-Pacific deal the same privileged status, according to the Thursday letter.\"We do not believe this approach is in the best interests of U.S. manufacturers and U.S. workers,\" the letter reads. \"Of special concern is the prospect that firms established in TPP countries, such as the many Chinese firms in Vietnam, could obtain waivers from Buy American policies. This could result in large sums of U.S. tax dollars being invested to strengthen other countries' manufacturing sectors, rather than our own.\"The letter from members of Congress to the administration marks a rare glimpse inside the typically secretive trade negotiation process. The terms of the free trade negotiations, including the Trans-Pacific pact, are withheld from the public, even though the governments of all the countries involved have access to them. Many major U.S. corporations have access to the draft negotiation texts through their positions on advisory boards to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the White House agency which negotiates trade deals.\"Buy American\" provisions do not help all U.S. firms equally. Corporations headquartered in the U.S. that offshore most of their manufacturing operations do not benefit from the system designed to promote domestic production in the way that companies with actual U.S. manufacturing operations do.Public interest groups also worry that the same trade policies that could ban Buy American breaks will also prevent the U.S. government from making environmental or public health stipulations in federal contracts. The current language barring preferential treatment for American goods is so broad as to limit government specifications on goods to purely functional aspects. When contracting for paper, for instance, the government could specify that it wants to buy paper of the dimensions 8.5\" by 11\" -- but it could not require that the paper be composed of recycled materials or use non-toxic dye.The potential \"Buy American\" ban also conflicts with a top theme of Obama's re-election campaign -- boosting U.S. manufacturing. In February, the administration proposed fixing a tax loophole that has been exploited by oil and gas companies in order to provide breaks to domestic manufacturers.

It felt like my brain exploded, and something changed in me on that day. It refueled my passion to tell a big story about the ocean.\" That's what Neville Spiteri shared in a recent interview when discussing the backstory of what inspired the creation of theBlu.Inspired by the oceans: a global interactive screensaver created by artists everywhereScott Yara and Neville Spiteri are the co-founders of theBlu, an app (developed by Wemo Media) that provides a diver's view of the living and breathing deep ocean complete with fish and fauna swimming through the screen of your computer. They organized a crew of unusual suspects (technology wonks, animators, and people in the entertainment industry) to each engage in the thing they are most passionate about with an end result of creating a virtual playground that promotes the protection of the ocean. The way it works is that Wemo Media put a call out to artists around the world to create original works of animation and 3-D art. People from from Los Angeles to Seoul to Mumbai responded. Once submitted, the artists enter into a collaborative process and receive feedback from world-renowned animators such as Oscar award-winning animator of Avatar, Andy Jones. So for artists, it's a collaborative platform and global gallery where they make a percentage of the profits every time someone purchases their fish. For mere pedestrians such as myself, every time I leave my computer I get to return to an ever-changing underwater world that appears as an interactive screen saver on my desk top.When Wemo Media first approached me to assist them with engagement I was ... shall we say ... skeptical? The ocean's in crisis and they're making an animated world that provides the illusion that the ocean is healthy and filled with fish? How does that help the situation? But then as I started playing around with the app (the first scene of dropping below the surface of the ocean really did stimulate a visceral memory of what it felt like to be snorkeling off the coast of Kauai), and as I listened to the stories of how founders Neville and Scott developed Wemo media and the impact they want their first project to have on the planet, what can I say, I was enthralled. It seemed like the exact dose of creativity we need at this moment to engage people with the ocean. Since most of us only see the top layer of the ocean that covers 71% of the planet, theBlu lets us dive in and provides a diver's perspective of the ocean in all of its beauty and magnificence. After living with the theBlu on my desktop for a few weeks, I've started craving being in the ocean. I think it's working ... I'm feeling oddly more connected with the ocean. It's a little bit like what I experienced while watching Avatar. I think my nervous system is responding to seeing images of a healthy planet. Now ... don't get me wrong: given that most Americans only spend 5% of their days outdoors, in no shape or form am I advocating this program as a replacement for time in the great big Momma Ocean. However, it was rather fascinating and unexpected to realize it was feeding my desire to start diving again.The eye of a whaleSo back to how Neville swam with a whale. During our interview, Neville shared that he was snorkeling in Hawaii when a humpback whale did a drive by, and looked him in the eye (if we could all be so lucky!). I've interviewed several people who have had direct contact with whales in the wild, and Neville said what every person who has ever looked a whale in the eye has said -- that his head and heart just about exploded and that life would never quite be the same again. But then Neville said something I hadn't heard before, that he came away recommitted to telling a big story about the ocean. When Neville and Scott joined forces to create Wemo Media (Wemo stands for world emotion) and aspired to rock the world with a radical new technology that would serve as a new platform for artists to engage and create on the internet as never before; they decided to make their first project about something they both cared dearly about: the ocean.Protecting the oceans one fish at a timeBut how does this app save the ocean? It doesn't. We do. (Especially when we reduce our use of single use plastics and give the ocean a break by reducing our intake of fish). Some of the fish have been chosen to be ambassadors of conservation organizations, and every time you or I purchase one of those fish, 25% of what we pay goes directly to ocean conservation. (Now I don't have to feel guilty every time I don't have a present on the day of a loved one's birthday -- I can tell them it was a choice! That I decided to give to the ocean to honor their birth and just send them a few fishes! (OK ... and get them a chocolate cake ... and ... balloons. Wait -- no balloons, turtles swallow them when they land in the ocean. So no balloons, just cake and fish. But not in that order.) Anyhoo, they will be revealing the lucky organizations who were selected to receive the donations at their launch in Times Square on May 4th, and will have an ongoing rotating program of giving to conservation organizations.Write a love letter to the ocean: get your tweet shown in Times SquareAnd Neville and Scott's dream is coming true: Wemo Media is telling a big story about the ocean by celebrating the launch of theBlu by honoring the ocean through a global love letter to the ocean that will be featured in Times Square on May 4th. People in NYC will get to engage right there on the streets and see their faces and their fish swim across the big screen in Times Square (5-11pm EST), while people around the world can virtually participate by tweeting and Facebooking their love letters to the ocean (selected comments will be featured on the Nasdaq screens).For example, I'll probably tweet: Dearest ocean, the thing I love most about you is the way you hold me when I float on my back so I can look up at the moon #theblu.If you prefer to Facebook your love letter, and want it to be considered for being on the big screens in Times Square, be sure and post on theBlu's Facebook page. For nature loving freaks like myself it's kind of thrilling to get to see the hyperactive screens of consumerism in Times Square get taken over by images of the deep sea and featured love letters to the ocean streaming in from around the world.Meanwhile, sad to say, outside of my fantasies of swimming with whales and diving off the coast of Kauai, the majority of my thoughts about the ocean tend to gravitate toward frightening topics such as mercury poisoning, oils spills, acidification, over fishing, too much plastic ... and on and on. I think that's why I got authentically excited when I was introduced to theBlu. Every time I return to my computer, and theBlu pops up, it reminds me of my passion and love of the ocean, and as Jacques Cousteau says, \"We protect the things we love.\""}, {"title": "The Sublime Beauty Of Patagonia's Perito Moreno Glacier", "text": "Dark clouds hang dramatically in the sky, contrasting with soaring white cliffs streaked with deep blue and rising high above a turquoise lake.

Mix's attorney said in a statement the charges against her client are meritless. Michael Monico, a Chicago criminal defense lawyer representing Sprague, said his client would not comment on the charges against Mix. BP would not comment on Sprague's role as Mix's supervisor.Federal investigators' focus on the well's flow rate was made clear with the Mix arrest -\u2013 the first and only time that criminal charges have been filed in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 rig crew members. Authorities charged Mix with obstruction of justice for destroying text messages discussing far higher flow estimates than BP revealed publicly at the time.More arrests tied to the spill estimates are highly likely, legal experts and a corporate insider said.\u201cI\u2019d be shocked if there weren\u2019t more arrests and charges, against people significantly higher up the food chain than Mix,\u201d said Dan Cogdell, a Houston criminal defense attorney specializing in white collar and environmental cases. It was \u201ccompletely transparent\u201d that prosecutors plan further arrests related to the flow rate, Cogdell said.Lawyers for one of BP's corporate partners on the Macondo well also have concluded that more individuals at the British oil giant may be indicted for covering up the true extent of the spill, according to a senior consultant for the firm, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation.Prosecutors may be targeting BP executives for withholding information about the company\u2019s internal flow-rate models with the government, said the consultant, who has discussed the matter with attorneys directly involved with civil and criminal litigation over the spill. .\"Other BP people are going to be indicted,\" he said. \"They're going after them on the flow rate.\"\"They're going to try to get some of the big boys,\" he added.In a statement on its website, BP said it would not discuss the charges against Mix, but said the company \"will continue cooperating in the Department of Justice's investigation.\"Mix faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, and prosecutors will likely use the possibility of a heavy sentence as a bargaining chip to coerce him to testify against higher-ups at the company.\"It's typical -- getting somebody under indictment that they might be able to crack, and then moving up the ladder,\" said Dick DeGuerin, a prominent Houston criminal defense attorney.In a statement, Mix's attorney, Joan McPhee, described the charges as misguided. \"We have every confidence that Kurt will be exonerated at trial,\" she said.An engineer who worked with Mix on efforts to seal the well said he was shocked to hear of the arrest. \"He's not in the hierarchy at all,\" said the engineer, who requested anonymity due to the ongoing investigation. \"I would be extremely surprised if he was trying to cover something up.\"But the engineer also said that the flow rate figures publicly endorsed by BP executives lacked credibility among those working to cap the well. The gap between the company's figures and reality became particularly obvious after live video of the leaking pipe began to be broadcast on the Internet and on national television, he said.BP's public estimates ranged from 1,000 barrels to 5,000 barrels per day through the first six weeks of the spill. A government-organized scientific team ultimately estimated that the flow averaged more than 50,000 barrels per day throughout the three-month spill.\"You could look at the video that was on the news every night and know that it's not 5,000 barrels a day,\" the engineer said. \"My granddaughter probably could have figured that out.\"Company emails and organizational charts for the oil spill response obtained by The Huffington Post outline BP's chain of command leading from Mix and upward through the corporate hierarchy.During the spill, Mix reported to Jonathan Sprague, identified in federal court documents as a BP vice president for global wells organization and a former manager of the company's extensive Gulf of Mexico operations, according to the organizational charts. An April 25, 2010, email shows that Mix shared with Sprague flow-rate calculations, including potential flow volumes from the well that were far higher than the company's public estimates.Sprague's involvement in the flow-rate estimates is further confirmed by an email exchange the New Orleans Times-Picayune obtained and first reported in January. That exchange took place on the day that the Deepwater Horizon, engulfed in flames, sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.Those emails involved Rob Marshall, manager of BP's sub-sea operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Gary Imm, a deepwater project manager, and Sprague. BP produced the emails as part of the civil litigation over the spill.In the emails, dated April 22, 2010, Marshall notified Imm and Sprague that Alistair Johnston, an expert retained by BP, had created a model estimating that the Macondo well may be leaking 82,000 barrels per day.In his response to Sprague and Marshall, Imm told them to keep the numbers under wraps. \"Please tell Alistair not to communicate to anyone on this,\" Imm wrote.Imm added that \"a number of people have been looking at\" the flow-rate estimates, and that company officials had already had \"difficult discussions\" with the Coast Guard about the figures.Other BP experts also generated flow-rate estimates far higher than the company's official figures at the time, documents show. On April 24, 2010, Mix estimated that the flow from the well was from 8,600 to 69,500 barrels per day, according to a federal affidavit. The next day, Doug Suttles, the BP executive, publicly endorsed the estimate of 1,000 barrels per day.BP has never disclosed the methodology behind the 1,000-barrel-per-day estimate. Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the Coast Guard official who led the initial federal response to the spill, said it was provided to her by Suttles.\"It would have been Doug Suttles,\" Landry said in an interview with The Huffington Post last June. \"Somebody was giving Doug numbers.\"During the initial weeks of the spill, Suttles, leading BP's response, was the company's chief liaison with the federal government. Suttles left BP, where he was chief operating officer for exploration and production, last year.Reached by cell phone this week, Landry declined to discuss the Justice Department investigation. An attorney for Suttles did not respond to a request for comment.According to DeGuerin, the defense attorney, government prosecutors do not need to show that BP officials lied to the federal government about the extent of the spill to win a criminal conviction. Any attempt to conceal the truth could result in a guilty verdict, he said.\"A dodge, an evasion, a coloring of the facts, is as bad as an outright lie,\" DeGuerin said. \"If it's not accurate, it's not accurate.\"BP faced stiff fines tied to the size of the Macondo spill. Federal environmental statutes mandate fines of up to $1,000 for every barrel of oil spilled into public waters. Over the 91 days the well spewed crude oil into the Gulf, the difference between 1,000 barrels per day and more than 50,000 barrels per day spirals into the billions of dollars.But if federal prosecutors are able to prove in court that BP officials covered up the magnitude of the spill, criminal convictions would likely cost the company even more in civil penalties. Under federal law, if a company is demonstrated to have engaged in \"willful misconduct\" in relation to an oil spill, the penalties can more than quadruple, to $4,300 per barrel.\"A failure to report the extent of the flow rate -- that would be a slam-dunk on willful misconduct, I think,\" said Jamison Colburn, an environmental law professor at Penn State University and former enforcement litigator for the EPA."}, {"title": "Asian American Fishermen Sue BP for Racial Discrimination", "text": "Vietnamese and Cambodian fishermen in Village L'est and Versailles in New Orleans East were among the first residents to return after Katrina, only to see their livelihoods crushed a few years later by the BP spill. In early April, 41 Asian-American fishermen sued BP in U.S. Eastern District of Louisiana court in New Orleans, claiming discrimination in the company's Vessels of Opportunity program. Other groups of fishermen have also sued over treatment in the VOO, which hired boats to remove spilled oil.Asian Americans were underrepresented in the program given their numbers in the Gulf fishing community. Over half of all commercial fishermen affected by the spill were Vietnamese and Cambodian Americans but they accounted for less than 10 percent of the vessels hired by BP, the suit says. Of the 5,000 vessels that BP engaged, only 350 belonged to Vietnamese and Cambodian Americans.Plaintiffs in the case are represented by attorney Ryan Beasley in Harvey, La.. The suit says that during the VOO program, BP sent emails to Danos and Curole Marine Contractors, LLC in Larose, La. and DRC Emergency Services, LLC, in Mobile, Ala., telling them not to hire vessels owned by Vietnamese and Cambodian Americans. The class action suit was filed against BP, Danos and Curole, and DRC Emergency, and seeks damages for civil rights violations and employment discrimination. The suit says that 4,000 Asian Americans were affected by BP's policies, and claims that defendants violated Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 -- which says all Americans have the same rights as white citizens.Why didn't BP want to hire Asian Americans? Attorneys and others point to the cost of translating legal language, a preference for workers outside the area closest to the spill, and cronyism -- between BP and its contractors and certain boat captains hired by the VOO.Last week, Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said \"I can't absolutely say whether or not there was discrimination against Asian American fishermen in the VOO. But we do know that local people were passed over in the program, and that was because they'd come back to the community and say there's oil all around.\"Nungesser continued, saying \"BP preferred to hire people who didn't live here, didn't have a passion for this area and who wouldn't let other people know what they'd seen.\" He said local fishing vessels were tied to docks while out-of-state boats were in the area working for the VOO.\"We asked but never got a list of boats that were working in the program,\" Nungesser said. \"That's absurd. We wanted to make sure local boats and fishermen hurt by the spill were being hired,\" especially since the waters in southeast Louisiana were closed to fishing.In addition to New Orleans East, Asian American fishermen live in Jefferson Parish and in Belle Chasse, Boothville-Venice and other Plaquemines Parish communities, along with Terrebonne Parish.Local fishermen complained in mid-2010 that recreational boats from Florida and Texas were floating by, working for the VOO in Louisiana waters while their boats were idle. But some Asian-American vessels and fishermen were hired by BP. A local staffing service ran ads in mid-2010 for Cambodian translators to work in the VOO in Venice in Plaquemines Parish. The starting salary was $17 to $18 an hour for translators, plus overtime and free room and board. That sounded pretty good if it hadn't been for the toxins rising from oil lapping the shores around Venice.Last week, BP spokesman Scott Dean had no comment on the Asian American lawsuit or on translation services that BP provided to VOO workers.Nungesser said \"unfortunately, it takes a lawsuit to get to the bottom of what happened. BP hasn't been forthright with people, and we've learned that we can't trust what the company says. It takes lawsuits and Congressional hearings to find out.\"A mid-2010 statement from the Asian Pacific American Society of New Orleans or APAS discussed U.S. District Court Judge Ginger Berrigan's May 2, 2010 decision that several provisions in BP's cleanup contract with fishermen and volunteers were illegal -- including terms requiring BP's exemption from liability, along with complete confidentiality required from workers and a demand that BP be listed on volunteers' insurance policies. Contracts handed out to Asian-American fishermen at the John Alario Center on the West Bank on a Sunday in mid-2010 included language that should have been removed after Judge Berrigan's decision, APAS warned. APAS told fishermen that even though illegal wording may have remained in Vietnamese versions of the contracts, those provisions couldn't be enforced.Tuan Nguyen, deputy director of Mary Queen of Vietnam Community Development Center in New Orleans East, said last week that many Asian-American fishermen, boat captains and deckhands live near the center and work out of Plaquemines, Jefferson and Terrebonne Parishes. \"We've done a lot of advocacy work with Vietnamese-American fishermen since the spill,\" he said. \"And we work with Catholic Charities to help them pay their bills. But we don't comment on litigation.\"Meanwhile, Asian fishermen, like others affected by the spill, have struggled with the BP claims process. \"There was confusion in the Asian-American fishing community about how to file claims with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility for economic losses,\" Nguyen said. \"People tried but often didn't understand how to navigate the system. Some of them took $5,000 final payments recently out of desperation and a need for cash, and gave up their rights to sue BP. Many of them are unhappy about that now.\"For Asian American and all fishermen who want to learn their rights and need help with BP claims, Nungesser recommended Seedco's newly-expanded Southeast Louisiana Fisheries Assistance Center Facility, which opened earlier this year next to his office in Belle Chasse. \"These people are doing a great job of helping fishermen get back on their feet and assisting them with legal matters,\" he said. The old office was in a temporary facility down the street.Before the BP spill, Asian Americans held 75 percent of shrimp licenses in Louisiana for vessels longer than 50 feet, according to data compiled by David Burrage, Mississippi State University extension professor of Marine Resources. And they held more than 60 percent of shrimp licenses for vessels longer than 45 feet in Mississippi and Alabama. A third of Gulf commercial boats with federal shrimp permits were owned and operated by Vietnamese-Americans before the spill.What's more, many seafood processing plants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama are staffed mainly by Asian Americans, particularly of Vietnamese descent. And of an estimated 40,000 Vietnamese living in these three Gulf states -- including 30,000 in Louisiana -- one in three works in the seafood industry, according to Dr. Burrage in 2009. In fact, incomes of most of Louisiana's Vietnamese-American households depend on seafood in one way or another.As for the VOO program, which was closed in 2010, BP temporarily reactivated it in August and September of last year because of seepage near its Macondo well.This article was published in The Louisiana Weekly in the April 30, 2012 edition."}, {"title": "Carli Davidson's 'Pets With Disabilities' Project (PHOTOS)", "text": "Carli Davidson is an animal person, to say the least.

Immediately after a disaster, it is easier to get reform than it is years later, when complacency begins to set in. Unfortunately, Congress failed to adopt any reforms, so federal agencies have had to do the majority of the work on safety and prevention.  Although the Obama administration has taken steps toward shoring up drilling safety, improvements to oil spill response planning remain untouched. So here we are, two years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and with drilling likely to occur this summer in America's Arctic Ocean, and no new response regulations have been adopted.  The extreme, remote and fragile Arctic Ocean is one of the most difficult places on Earth to mount a rescue operation or spill response. The region has no major roads, ports, or airports. The nearest Coast Guard base is more than 1,000 miles away. Hurricane-force winds, subzero temperatures, high seas, shifting sea ice, and long periods of fog and darkness are the norm and could shut down a response altogether.The Interior Department should work with stakeholders-including industry, government, Native organizations, scientists, and conservation groups -- to ensure that strong safety and spill-response standards apply to all companies that plan to drill in the Arctic Ocean. For example: Seasonal restrictions are needed so that operators have finished drilling by the time ice starts to form in October. No proven methods exist to clean up oil in broken ice.The faster a cleanup operation is mounted, the better. Poor weather could impede delivery and response time. Key equipment, such as a well-capping device and a Polar-class relief well rig, need to be stationed in the Arctic region.A long-term, comprehensive science and monitoring program should be developed to better guide decisions about if, where, when, and how drilling can take place safely.Finally, there should be heightened protection of sensitive areas that are important to the marine ecosystem and the Inupiat people who depend on it for their traditional way of life.  To put strong protections in place will require everyone to work collaboratively. That is the only way to help safeguard the Arctic from a disastrous oil spill."}, {"title": "The Fox (Monsanto) Buys the Chicken Coop (Beeologics)", "text": "Why would one of the largest purveyors of pesticides, genetically engineered seeds and agrochemicals want to buy a company which has been seeking solutions to the escalating threats to the world bee population?Monsanto spokeswomen Kelly Powers says it is to give the fledgling company a helping hand. Beeologics has developed a product called Remembee, an anti-viral agent which its boosters claim will help stem the tide of Colony Collapse Disorder, a mysterious plague which has led to the disappearance of the bees in up to a third of the commercial colonies located in the U.S. during the last decade.The root of the problem, however, may not be the virus targeted by Remembee, a chemical agent which utilizes RNA interference, a mechanism that blocks gene expression, but the herbicides and insecticides that agro-chemical giants like Monsanto, Dow and Bayer have themselves been hawking to farmers around the world.This is the conclusion of three recent studies which implicate a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or \"neonics\" for short, which coat a massive 142 million acres of corn, wheat, soy and cotton seeds in the U.S. alone. They are also a common ingredient in a wide variety of home gardening products. As I detail in an article which was published by Reuters last month, neonics are absorbed by the plants' vascular system and contaminate the pollen and nectar that bees encounter on their rounds. Neonics are a nerve poison that disorient their insect victims and appear to damage the homing ability of bees, which may help to account for their mysterious failure to make it back to the hive.This was the conclusion of research which came out in the prestigious Journal Science  during March. In another study conducted by entomologists at Purdue University the scientists found that neonic-containing dust released into the air at planting time had \"lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers.\" A third study by the Harvard School of Public Health actually re-created colony collapse disorder in several honeybee hives simply by administering small doses of a popular neonic, imidacloprid.While these studies strongly suggest that herbicides are a culprit, scientists caution that colony collapse disorder is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes, ranging from the loss of wild bee habitats to the weakening of bee immune systems as a result of poor diet (commercial bees are frequently fed pesticide-laced corn syrup instead of their own honey) and also the techniques of modern beekeeping, which include the artificial insemination of queens, and the resulting loss of genetic diversity in the bee population.Some have also pointed the finger at the pollen from genetically modified Roundup Ready corn which bees ingest, and which contains a powerful insecticide within its genetic structure. Roundup seeds are manufactured by Monsanto, and are currently planted across wide swaths of the American Midwest and elsewhere.So with Monsanto products themselves amongst the key suspects in Colony Collapse Disorder, one might ask: Why has the multinational bought a company which has been a key player in researching this disorder as well as Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, another scourge of bees?\"We're absolutely committed to Beeologics' existing work,\" said Monsanto spokesperson Kelly Powers. Yet one has to wonder if owning a firm dedicated to shedding light on the trouble with bees might not serve Monsanto's interest in allowing it to further cover up their own corporate complicity in the problem.Let us hope that Monsanto is as good as its word and uses this newly acquired company to boldly get to the bottom of the mystery of the disappearing bees. But if history is any guide, there is little cause for optimism. The health watchdog group \"Natural Society\" rated Monsanto \"the worst in 2011 for its ongoing work to threaten human health and the environment.\"With its acquisition of Beeologic, the multinational has a chance to start improving its record -- right? My advice, however, is don't hold your breath!"}, {"title": "Too Hot Not to Notice?", "text": "A Planet Connected by Wild WeatherCross-posted with TomDispatch.comThe Williams River was so languid and lovely last Saturday morning that it was almost impossible to imagine the violence with which it must have been running on August 28, 2011. And yet the evidence was all around: sand piled high on its banks, trees still scattered as if by a giant\u2019s fist, and most obvious of all, a utilitarian temporary bridge where for 140 years a graceful covered bridge had spanned the water.The YouTube video of that bridge crashing into the raging river was Vermont\u2019s iconic image from its worst disaster in memory, the record flooding that followed Hurricane Irene\u2019s rampage through the state in August 2011. It claimed dozens of lives, as it cut more than a billion-dollar swath of destruction across the eastern United States.I watched it on TV in Washington just after emerging from jail, having been arrested at the White House during mass protests of the Keystone XL pipeline. Since Vermont\u2019s my home, it took the theoretical -- the ever more turbulent, erratic, and dangerous weather that the tar sands pipeline from Canada would help ensure -- and made it all too concrete. It shook me bad.And I\u2019m not the only one.New data released last month by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities show that a lot of Americans are growing far more concerned about climate change, precisely because they\u2019re drawing the links between freaky weather, a climate kicked off-kilter by a fossil-fuel guzzling civilization, and their own lives. After a year with a record number of multi-billion dollar weather disasters, seven in ten Americans now believe that \u201cglobal warming is affecting the weather.\u201d No less striking, 35 percent of the respondents reported that extreme weather had affected them personally in 2011. As Yale\u2019s Anthony Laiserowitz told the New York Times, \u201cPeople are starting to connect the dots.\u201dWhich is what we must do. As long as this remains one abstract problem in the long list of problems, we\u2019ll never get to it. There will always be something going on each day that\u2019s more important, including, if you\u2019re facing flood or drought, the immediate danger.But in reality, climate change is actually the biggest thing that\u2019s going on every single day. If we could only see that pattern we\u2019d have a fighting chance. It\u2019s like one of those trompe l\u2019oeil puzzles where you can only catch sight of the real picture by holding it a certain way. So this weekend we\u2019ll be doing our best to hold our planet a certain way so that the most essential pattern is evident. At 350.org, we\u2019re organizing a global day of action that\u2019s all about dot-connecting; in fact, you can follow the action at climatedots.org.The day will begin in the Marshall Islands of the far Pacific, where the sun first rises on our planet, and where locals will hold a daybreak underwater demonstration on their coral reef already threatened by rising seas. They\u2019ll hold, in essence, a giant dot -- and so will our friends in Bujumbura, Burundi, where March flooding destroyed 500 homes. In Dakar, Senegal, they\u2019ll mark the tidal margins of recent storm surges. In Adelaide, Australia, activists will host a \u201cdry creek regatta\u201d to highlight the spreading drought down under.Pakistani farmers -- some of the millions driven from their homes by unprecedented flooding over the last two years -- will mark the day on the banks of the Indus; in Ayuthaya, Thailand, Buddhist monks will protest next to a temple destroyed by December\u2019s epic deluges that also left the capital, Bangkok, awash.Activists in Ulanbataar will focus on the ongoing effects of drought in Mongolia. In Daegu, South Korea, students will gather with bags of rice and umbrellas to connect the dots between climate change, heavy rains, and the damage caused to South Korea\u2019s rice crop in recent years. In Amman, Jordan, Friends of the Earth Middle East will be forming a climate dot on the shores of the Dead Sea to draw attention to how climate-change-induced drought has been shrinking that sea.In Herzliya, Israel, people will form a dot on the beach to stand in solidarity with island nations and coastal communities around the world that are feeling the impact of climate change. In newly freed Libya, students will hold a teach-in. In Oman, elders will explain how the weather along the Persian Gulf has shifted in their lifetimes. There will be actions in the cloud forests of Costa Rica, and in the highlands of Peru where drought has wrecked the lives of local farmers. In Monterrey, Mexico, they\u2019ll recall last year\u2019s floods that did nearly $2 billion in damage. In Chamonix, France, climbers will put a giant red dot on the melting glaciers of the Alps.And across North America, as the sun moves westward, activists in Halifax, Canada, will \u201cswim for survival\u201d across its bay to highlight rising sea levels, while high-school students in Nashville, Tennessee, will gather on a football field inundated by 2011\u2019s historic killer floods.In Portland, Oregon, city dwellers will hold an umbrella-decorating party to commemorate March\u2019s record rains. In Bandelier, New Mexico, firefighters in full uniform will remember last year\u2019s record forest fires and unveil the new solar panels on their fire station. In Miami, Manhattan, and Maui, citizens will line streets that scientists say will eventually be underwater. In the high Sierra, on one of the glaciers steadily melting away, protesters will unveil a giant banner with just two words, a quote from that classic of western children\u2019s literature, The Wizard of Oz. \u201cI\u2019m Melting\u201d it will say, in letters three-stories high.This is a full-on fight between information and disinformation, between the urge to witness and the urge to cover-up. The fossil-fuel industry has funded endless efforts to confuse people, to leave an impression that nothing much is going on. But -- as with the tobacco industry before them -- the evidence has simply gotten too strong.Once you saw enough people die of lung cancer, you made the connection. The situation is the same today. Now, it\u2019s not just the scientists and the insurance industry; it\u2019s your neighbors. Even pleasant weather starts to seem weird. Fifteen thousand U.S. temperature records were broken, mainly in the East and Midwest, in the month of March alone, as a completely unprecedented heat wave moved across the continent. Most people I met enjoyed the rare experience of wearing shorts in winter, but they were still shaking their heads. Something was clearly wrong and they knew it.The one institution in our society that isn\u2019t likely to be much help in spreading the news is... the news. Studies show our papers and TV channels paying ever less attention to our shifting climate. In fact, in 2011 ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox spent twice as much time discussing Donald Trump as global warming. Don\u2019t expect representatives from Saturday\u2019s Connect the Dots day to show up on Sunday\u2019s talk shows. Over the last three years, those inside-the-Beltway extravaganzas have devoted 98 minutes total to the planet\u2019s biggest challenge. Last year, in fact, all the Sunday talk shows spent exactly nine minutes of Sunday talking time on climate change -- and here\u2019s a shock: all of it was given over to Republican politicians in the great denial sweepstakes.So here\u2019s a prediction: next Sunday, no matter how big and beautiful the demonstrations may be that we\u2019re mounting across the world, \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and \u201cMeet the Press\u201d won\u2019t be connecting the dots. They\u2019ll be gassing along about Newt Gingrich\u2019s retirement from the presidential race or Mitt Romney\u2019s coming nomination, and many of the commercials will come from oil companies lying about their environmental efforts. If we\u2019re going to tell this story -- and it\u2019s the most important story of our time -- we\u2019re going to have to tell it ourselves.Bill McKibben, a TomDispatch regular, and the author, most recently, of Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet, is the founder of 350.org, which is coordinating Saturday\u2019s Connect the Dots day.

Captured by Associated Press photographer Steve Vaughn on May 1 in Hamilton, Ohio, the image shows both a lightning strike and a double rainbow.According to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a double rainbow happens when the ray of light that causes a single rainbow is reflected twice within raindrops and exits at a greater angle than a single rainbow. The Straight Dope explains:Because the twice-reflected light has had two chances to be transmitted out the back of the raindrop rather than reflected back toward the observer, the secondary bow is much fainter than the primary and frequently cannot be seen at all; it's typical for a secondary rainbow to be visible only at certain points along the arc.Luckily for Vaughn, he was able to witness both rainbows as a lightning bolt pierced the sky.

I was inspired at times, convinced we've got a world of troubles, but nonplussed by the uplifting, optimistic spin at the film's end.The Ecstasy -- Water as InspirationThe most enthralling part of Last Call at the Oasis, directed by Oscar-winner Jessica Yu, by far happens during the opening segments of the film when we are treated to a sequence of water shots -- flowing water, splashing water, droplets of water, and people drinking, swimming in, bathing in, just plain in ecstasy over water. Vaguely reminiscent of the early documentaries known as the \"city symphonies\" (see here and here) or maybe a cross between them and the opening paean in Woody Allen's Manhattan. Amazing, beautiful stuff -- worth the price of admission.The shift from inspiration to water troubles occurs with the voice of Erin Brockovich, you know, the single-mom-turned-environmental-activist who became a household name when Julia Roberts embodied her in the eponymous movie by Stephen Soderbergh. The real-life Brockovich, one of the film's lead voices, frames the theme of Oasis -- the centrality of water to our existence. (Minor science peeve: Brockovich says that water is the essential \"element\" for life. Actually not -- water is a molecule not an element.)The film's main thrust focuses on two aspects of the water crisis: the shortage of fresh water and the dangers of pollution in drinking water.The depiction of the water-shortage issue features world-renowned scientists: Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute (whose Freedom of Information requests have turned up at least \"100 cases of bottled water recalls that we know about for things like coliform bacteria\"), Aaron Wolf of Oregon State University (whose study of documented water disputes over the past 50 years showed that of the 1,800 disputes, \"two thirds were cooperative\" and involved \"very little violence and no wars\"), and Jay Famiglietti of the University of California at Irvine (who believes the problem is far greater than mass conservation can resolve).They do a very good job of laying out the scientific information on why and how our use of water in some regions is overwhelming supply and is not sustainable. And while scientists often get knocked for being technocratic, data-spouting talking heads, these guys do, in this humble scientist's opinion, an excellent job of being relaxed, likeable, and engaging.A good deal of this section of the film focuses on the arid American West, including California's Central Valley and Las Vegas, where growing demand for water, fueled by urban expansion and rapid development coupled with dwindling supply (caused by droughts and climate change), threatens to leave millions of people high and dry.Environmental activist Erin Brockovich is a main voice in the film, shown arguing and fighting for better water quality around the country. (ATO Pictures)Our spokespersons for the section on water quality are activist Brockovich and Tyrone Hayes, a scientist at the University of California at Berkeley.Brockovich, no stranger to the camera, takes us to Midland, Texas, where, even though folks' well water is polluted by hexavalent chromium, a carcinogen, they can't find anyone in government or industry willing or able to do anything about it. (The wrap-up section to the film's many story threads informs us that in Hinkley, California, the site of Brockovich's original activism brought to light in the 2000 Soderbergh movie, the electricity company PG&E \"offered to buy over 100 homes in the contaminated area.\")Brockovich then discusses a project she has undertaken, creating a map of all the locations from where she has received emails and other communications from people all around the country reporting community health problems. The map, showing affected places across the entire United States, is pretty sobering and at a Senate hearing appeared to get the attention of Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), but let's be a little careful -- a database compiled from emails is hardly scientifically rigorous.Hayes's portion of the film features his work on the effect of water pollution from pesticides on frogs. This section has a light note to it, with clips of hermaphrodite frogs trying to couple, as Hayes looks on in a mix of dumbfounded delight and near disbelief.This is all fairly daunting and eye-opening and should give us all pause. But one thing Participant Media, the production company behind the film, strives for in all of its movies is to \"inspire social change,\" as the production notes put it. And so director Yu has made sure that her audience hears about what can be done to conserve water and use it more efficiently. My guess is that you are already aware of most of these -- like cutting back on watering lawns, using low-flow toilets, not buying bottled water -- but they are worth repeating. Even though they're easily incorporated into our everyday lives, there are an awful lot of folks out there who fail to partake. Case in point: the thriving business in bottled water.I found quite interesting the segment on using recycled/purified wastewater -- including from our toilets -- for drinking water. We visit with the astronauts on the Space Station while they slurp up water that had formerly been their urine and with a PR firm trying to come up with catchy brand names for bottled water derived from sewage. (The winner? Porcelain Springs, which then gets a plug from actor Jack Black. The testing out on the public is highly amusing.)While this is an important film and worth checking out, there's stuff that bothers me a bit. For one, the solutions touted in it, like using a low-flow toilet, are nice, but they're not going to solve the water-shortage problem. Much more fundamental change is needed, and that brings me to my next point.For me, the bigger issue touching water that needs serious attention is agriculture and food production. (Photo: ATO Pictures)Agriculture is a huge water issue that does not get much air time in Oasis. In the film the major culprits causing water shortages are urban development and water-wasting people. But the fact is that agriculture is by far and away the greatest user of water.If we want to solve the water-shortage issue, we ultimately have to address water usage in agriculture. And it's not just water availability; it's also water quality. Agriculture is responsible for a good deal of the fresh water pollution in the United States.We're not going to solve our water problems without coming to terms with agriculture as a profligate water user and polluter.And while we can't survive without water, we also need food, and food comes from agriculture. Oasis would have been a far more incisive film if its solutions included ones that addressed that little conundrum.In addition to being at the root of many of our water problems, food production is also a driver of other serious environmental problems: loss of habitat and biodiversity, carbon emissions and climate change, dead zones in the ocean, pesticides and antibiotics in our food. Solving these problems is no easy task. We face a world where we will need to feed nine billion people. It's not obvious how we will do this while also lowering the environmental footprint of agriculture.The intended theme of the movie may be that the \"global water crisis [is the] central issue facing our world this century,\" but it left me thinking about a coming global crisis in food production.Last Call at the Oasis began its screening rounds on the documentary festival circuit in March and will begin a national tour in selected movie theaters around the country starting on May 4 with showings in New York and Los Angeles.

From devastating flooding in Thailand to historic drought in Texas, global warming has moved from an abstraction to a dangerous new reality. Here in the United States, 82 percent of Americans say that they've experienced a natural disaster or extreme weather event first-hand.Yet, despite a few notable exceptions, the mainstream media has failed to connect the dots between this string of extreme weather events and global warming. Instead, coverage of climate change has dropped precipitously. A recent report by Media Matters for America found out that nightly news coverage on the major networks decreased 72 percent between 2009 and 2011. The Sunday shows, traditionally seen as forums for discussing the \"important issues\" of the day, have all spent more time covering Donald Trump than they have climate change.If the mainstream media won't connect the dots, then it's up to the rest of us to try. This Saturday, 350.org's global network of volunteers, activists, and organizations are hosting over 1,000 events in more than 100 countries to \"connect the dots\" between extreme weather and climate change.Firefighters in New Mexico will hold posters with dots in a forest ravaged by wildfires, while divers in the Marshall Islands take a dot underwater to their dying coral reefs. On glaciers in the Alps, Andes, and Sierras, climbers will unfurl dots on melting glaciers with the simple message: \"I'm Melting.\" Villagers in Northeastern Kenya will create dots to show how ongoing drought is killing their crops, while city-dwellers in Rio de Janeiro hold dots where mudslides from unusually heavy rains wiped out part of their neighborhood. The list goes on.Here at 350 HQ, we'll be doing our best to collect photos and videos from the events, edit them together into slideshows and b-roll in record time, get them moving across social media, and push content out to mainstream news networks. If we're successful, Saturday will be another big step forward in waking the world up to the urgent threat of the climate crisis.It's this type of online-to-offline, new-to-traditional media mash-up that I think holds some promise for those of us who are struggling to move climate change from a low public priority to a top-tier political concern. We'll never have the big advertising budgets of the fossil fuel industry, but we can assemble enough cell-phone cameras, Flickr feeds, and YouTube videos to show people how climate change is a clear and present danger rather than some nuisance for the future.Over the last few years coordinating our communications here at 350.org, I've seen how citizen-powered journalism can help push the mainstream media to cover the climate crisis. The day before our first global day of action in 2009, we got a skype call from our organizers in Ethiopia who told us that they were about to have a march with 15,000 school children in the streets of Addis Ababa to call for action on climate change, but that they didn't have anyone to film the demonstration and that there weren't any international media outlets with cameras in the city. A few Skype calls later, my colleague Adam tracked down a friend of a friend of a friend who happened to be in Addis with a camera. She quickly hopped on her bicycle, filmed the rally, found high-speed Internet at a hotel bar (ordered a drink so she could use it for free), uploaded the footage to us in New York, we cut it into b-roll in iMovie, sent it over to CNN, and they put it on the air a few hours later.In 2010, we turned to artists like Thom Yorke and Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada to help get the message across. They designed images large enough to be photographed by satellite and we brought together thousands of people to form the pictures on the ground. Imagine the logistics involved in organizing hundreds of people to form a \"human river\" in the desert outside Santa Fe while timing the whole thing to coincide with a satellite flying overhead at over 100 mph -- then times that by 12 different events across the planet. The art worked: outlets around the world picked up the pictures and ran with them.Last August, during the White House sit-ins against the Keystone XL pipeline, we only began to get media coverage after days of our own photographers and videographers cranking out photos and videos of everyday citizens being led away in handcuffs. Now, hardly a day goes by without an article about the pipeline and the latest political ploy to revive that zombie.This Saturday will be a unique challenge. It's been just over a month since we sent out the invitation for Climate Impacts Day. We're still finding typos and glitches on the website, scrambling to get together updated press lists, and find enough hours in the day to coordinate more than 1,000 events spanning nearly every continent (still working on an Antarctic action). But all across the world people have picked up the theme and are organizing with incredible creativity. As it turns out, in many places around the world, people already deeply understand between the floods that wiped out their village or the drought that killed their crop and the pollution that the fossil fuel industry is spewing out day after day.They've connected the dots. We'll see if the mainstream media can too."}, {"title": "Gobi Desert Dust Storms Seen From Space (PHOTOS)", "text": "Dust plumes blew out of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China on April 26 and 27, and NASA's Aqua satellite was there to capture images of the storms from space, according to the agency's Earth Observatory website.Several natural-color photos taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite show the giant dust clouds as they \"fanned out toward the southeast\" from the Mongolian border towards Beijing.By April 27, \"a veil of dust hung over eastern China, with a fairly thick plume stretching across Bo Hai,\" according to Earth Observatory.Scroll Down For Images Of Gobi Desert Dust Storms From SpaceThe Gobi Desert, which sits on the border between China and Mongolia, frequently produces dust storms during the spring, which generally peak in April, according to a climatology study of Mongolia published by Elsevier.

Operators inject up to 4 million gallons of fluid, under more than 10,000 pounds of pressure, to drill and frack each well.Scientists have theorized that impermeable layers of rock would keep the fluid, which contains benzene and other dangerous chemicals, safely locked nearly a mile below water supplies. This view of the earth's underground geology is a cornerstone of the industry's argument that fracking poses minimal threats to the environment.But the study, using computer modeling, concluded that natural faults and fractures in the Marcellus, exacerbated by the effects of fracking itself, could allow chemicals to reach the surface in as little as \"just a few years.\"\"Simply put, [the rock layers] are not impermeable,\" said the study's author, Tom Myers, an independent hydrogeologist whose clients include the federal government and environmental groups.\"The Marcellus shale is being fracked into a very high permeability,\" he said. \"Fluids could move from most any injection process.\"The research for the study was paid for by Catskill Mountainkeeper and the Park Foundation, two upstate New York organizations that have opposed gas drilling and fracking in the Marcellus.Much of the debate about the environmental risks of gas drilling has centered on the risk that spills could pollute surface water or that structural failures would cause wells to leak.Though some scientists believed it was possible for fracking to contaminate underground water supplies, those risks have been considered secondary. The study in Ground Water is the first peer-reviewed research evaluating this possibility.The study did not use sampling or case histories to assess contamination risks. Rather, it used software and computer modeling to predict how fracking fluids would move over time. The simulations sought to account for the natural fractures and faults in the underground rock formations and the effects of fracking.The models predict that fracking will dramatically speed up the movement of chemicals injected into the ground. Fluids traveled distances within 100 years that would take tens of thousands of years under natural conditions. And when the models factored in the Marcellus' natural faults and fractures, fluids could move 10 times as fast as that.Where man-made fractures intersect with natural faults, or break out of the Marcellus layer into the stone layer above it, the study found, \"contaminants could reach the surface areas in tens of years, or less.\"The study also concluded that the force that fracking exerts does not immediately let up when the process ends. It can take nearly a year to ease.As a result, chemicals left underground are still being pushed away from the drill site long after drilling is finished. It can take five or six years before the natural balance of pressure in the underground system is fully restored, the study found.Myers' research focused exclusively on the Marcellus, but he said his findings may have broader relevance. Many regions where oil and gas is being drilled have more permeable underground environments than the one he analyzed, he said.\"One would have to say that the possible travel times for a similar thing in Arkansas or Northeast Texas is probably faster than what I've come up with,\" Myers said.Ground Water is the journal of the National Ground Water Association, a non-profit group that represents scientists, engineers and businesses in the groundwater industry.Several scientists called Myers' approach unsophisticated and said that the assumptions he used for his models didn't reflect what they knew about the geology of the Marcellus Shale. If fluids could flow as quickly as Myers asserts, said Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Penn State University who has been a proponent of shale development, fracking wouldn't be necessary to open up the gas deposits.\"This would be a huge fracture porosity,\" Engelder said. \"So I read this and I say, 'Golly, does this guy really understand anything about what these shales look like?' The concern then arises from using a model rather than observations.\"Myers likened the shale to a cracked window, saying that samples showing it didn't contain fractures were small in size and were akin to only examining an intact section of glass, while a broader, scaled out view would capture the faults and fractures that could leak.Both scientists agreed that direct evidence of fluid migration is needed, but little sampling has been done to analyze where fracking fluids go after being injected underground.Myers says monitoring systems could be installed around gas well sites to measure for changes in water quality, a measure required for some gold mines, for example. Until that happens, Myers said, theoretical modeling has to substitute for hard data.\"We were trying to use the basic concepts of groundwater and hydrology and geology and say can this happen?\" he said. \"And that had basically never been done.\""}, {"title": "When Scientists Speak, Who Listens?", "text": "Scientists get no respect these days. When they speak, no one listens. It doesn't matter how many scientists are speaking, what they are saying, or what their qualifications are, they get a fraction of the media attention lavished on a reality TV star or an American Idol contestant. Three thousand scientists and experts, including a number of Nobel Laureates, joined together and issued a warning several weeks ago about the planet and possible \"catastrophic consequences\" for global civilization, but Kim Kardashian and her alleged marriage woes stole the headlines. The Royal Society, the world's oldest and most distinguished academy of science, late last month issued a report on how increasing population and rising consumption are imperiling the planet. Sir John Sulston, the Nobel Prize Laureate who chaired the working group,cautioned about a possible \"downward vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills,\" but his warning got less press attention in the U.S. than Mitt Romney's dog.If scientists get any media attention it's only because the science-deniers are ridiculing them. When the Royal Society produced its \"Population and the Planet,\" report, the ink was not even dry before the critics were slashing away at it. A writer for The Economist declared, \"On the whole it stinks.\" A self-described \"global expert on the metal scandium,\" asserts in Forbes and The Telegraph, that it is \"an appallingly bad report\" and \"a dismal failure.\" Really? Did anyone actually read the report, or look at the credentials of those who wrote it? Doubtful.We live in the Era of Willful Ignorance. It is not only acceptable; it is fashionable to throw scientific caution to the wind. The Euro has more 'currency' than scientific warnings about climate change, food security, the oceans, or biodiversity loss. Any scientist venturing into the public realm, no matter how respected by his or her peers, is treated like an intellectual varmint by politicians, special interests, and arm-chair critics, who immediately open up with a volley of prefabricated rebuttals and personal attacks.Because these rhetorical assaults are so successful, political leaders shy away from embracing scientific conclusions for fear that they will alienate uninformed voters, who easily make up a majority of the electorate. You can count on one hand the number of politicians taking a leadership role on climate change or any of the other environmental challenges facing the world. And God forbid that any elected official should suggest that the planet is in peril or that the economic growth engine as we have known it over the past century is not sustainable. Issues like food security, loss of biodiversity, and resource scarcity are politically taboo. Do a search of the Congressional Record and you will find that these issues are rarely, if ever, discussed.History will not be kind to today's leaders. Decades from now, posterity will look back at what passes today for political discourse in this country and they will ask, \"What planet were they living on?\" They will marvel at how politicians could be so heedless of science and so neglectful of posterity.The fault, of course, is not with our leaders, but with us. In a representative democracy we get the government we deserve. If we are more concerned about Kim Kardashian's marriage or Mitt Romney's dog than we are about the future of humanity, we can hardly blame our elected representatives for their lack of courage and foresight. As England's Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli said more than a century ago, \"There go the people, and I must follow, for I am their leader.\"I don't know how we translate scientific warnings into actionable awareness, but the key, I suspect, is making people understand that the future is now. A year ago, Jeremy Grantham, the co-founder of GMO, one of the largest investment management firms in the world, caused a stir in the financial community when he wrote a newsletter titled, \"Time to wake up: Days of abundant resources and falling prices are over forever.\" Grantham's analysis suggests that the world is already experiencing the effects of resource scarcity, and that climate change and other factors could make life more difficult for current generations, not just posterity.Grantham is highly respected in financial circles. If his analysis is correct, and there is every reason to believe it is, then people may begin to attach a higher degree of urgency to what scientists are telling us about the world. Let's hope so."}, {"title": "A Critical Look at Hotel Sustainability", "text": "The hotel industry is in the midst of a sustainability awakening -- and on a level deeper than offering guests the option to reuse bath towels. Industry leaders are beginning to get serious about their energy and environmental footprints. If we're lucky, this transition could include consumer accessibility to hotel sustainability data that does for the lodging industry what nutrition facts and organic labeling have done for the food industry.The number of LEED-certified hotels doubled last year. An industry working group organized by the International Tourism Partnership and World Travel & Tourism Council is set to release its new hotel carbon accounting standard, long under development, in June. And the business travelers that comprise a critical customer base are paying unprecedented attention to hotel impacts, with 40% of Global 500 companies now publicly reporting employee travel footprints. With US hotels using more than $6 billion worth of energy every year and generating 35 million metric tons of CO2 in the process, a trend toward sustainability is nontrivial.In light of this growing emphasis on hotel efficiency, we at Brighter Planet began searching for hard data on where the industry actually stands on energy and carbon efficiency. When we came up short, realizing that very little quantitative information was available on the state of US hotel efficiency, we decided to fill that gap ourselves. Our findings, based on analysis of the impacts of 46,000 individual US hotels, help to paint a picture of where the industry stands on sustainability performance.For starters, we found massive variation in hotel energy and emissions per room-night. Impact per room-night varies more than tenfold among US hotels, with the dirtiest quarter of properties accounting for more than half of the entire industry's energy use while the cleanest quarter uses less than 8%.And it turns out that this variation plays out in interesting ways across hotel chains, luxury levels, geographies, and hotel ages. Vagabond Inns, Red Lion Hotels, and Red Carpet Inns took top spots in our energy and carbon efficiency rankings of 75 US hotel chains. On average, budget hotels outperform upscale establishments on sustainability. And hotel vintage data shows an unambiguous trend toward less and less efficient hotels, with energy use per room-night doubling between the 1960s and the 2000s -- a troubling trend, but one that may explain the current surge in sustainability interest among hoteliers.But an equally important finding was that even within a given city, a given chain, or a given luxury level, major efficiency variation still exists. This means that regardless of location or budget, significant opportunities exist for almost all travelers to reduce their footprints simply through their choice of hotel. If authoritative hotel efficiency data were available to travelers at the point of sale, it would offer a whole new way to cut carbon beyond the traditional suggestion of simply reducing travel (which can be a nonstarter for business and leisure travelers alike).I look forward to the day when this data is readily available. When we do reach that point -- and current data and software offerings suggest that could be soon -- it will be a boon for travelers and progressive hotels. It will provide non-greenwashed transparency and actionable decision support to travelers, and it will reward efficient hotels, helping accelerate the much-needed transition toward sustainability in an industry that's been trending in quite the opposite direction."}, {"title": "Sustainable Prosperity", "text": "Worldwatch Institute (WWI), the renowned Washington-based environmental think tank, is at odds with the Republican Party. In its annual State of the World report, WWI makes a documented case that we are on an unsustainable path, with an estimated one and a half earths needed to support humanity's current use of dwindling natural resources.Most Republican politicians dismiss such a grim prognosis as poppycock. They view the world's resources as bountiful for the foreseeable future and begging to be exploited.Undeterred, the WWI warns that unless mankind gains control over its excesses and contracts the global economy by one-third, a severe crisis will probably end up forcing a jumpstart towards sustainability, and the process won't be pretty.To facilitate an orderly transition, WWI proposes that all people's basic needs should and can be met without depriving future generations of the same benefits. In the think tank's view, this is a crucial step towards achieving the goals of \"sustainable prosperity\" and enduring ecological health. The redistribution of wealth (a toxic phrase to the GOP) would be essential, with a guaranteed universal living wage being a key strategy in attaining sustainability. Otherwise, the downtrodden could ultimately strip the environment bare out of sheer desperation.In the WWI's master plan, social relationships and intellectual accomplishment would replace conspicuous material consumption as the driving force in our daily lives. The economy and human population would ideally stabilize at environmentally sustainable levels rather than be engines of unrelenting expansion, and government would award subsidies for public infrastructure and the spread of \"green energy\" as an alternative to \"dirty\" fossil fuels. Environmental governance would supersede corporate governance instead of the other way around, primarily through stricter regulation of industrial polluters, greater reliance on land use planning, and increased global cooperation in tackling climate change and other trans-boundary environmental problems.These are policies that today's modern Republican Party has denounced in near apocalyptic terms, warning of the loss of individual freedom, abdication of capitalism to socialism or worse, the ceding of national sovereignty to a world government, and foolishly trying to substitute unproven renewable energy for more reliable fossil fuels.How will WWI respond to any Republican criticisms? Even Democrats sympathetic to WWI's long term perspective would dare not directly champion reduced consumption. Our present shopping patterns are too deeply ingrained in current culture to be purged overnight and any attempt to do so would be political suicide.WWI recognizes that in the face of widespread initial intransigence, the transition it is promoting will have to occur incrementally and through indirect means. The acquisitive instinct is too much a part of human nature to ever be completely extinguished, but it can be steered in a sustainable direction. WWI researchers are confident that any fears that reduced consumption will lead to material deprivation can be readily overcome as the concept \"less is more\" gains traction in society.WWI believes tax reform which encourages environmentally friendly alternatives such as recycling and reuse and penalizes wasteful practices and overexploitation of raw materials would be an important move towards sustainable prosperity. So would revision of our educational system to inculcate the gratification derived from shifting from a consumer-based to a value-based society. WWI notes that this transition will need political leadership at the top, an element that has so far been missing on a global scale.Bottom line: whether you accept the environmental think tank's future vision, there is no denying the inexorable law of supply and demand's effect on the earth's remaining natural resources."}, {"title": "When Global Warming Ate My Life", "text": "Hell is not a place; it's a time. It starts with the experience of irreversible loss and ends as you learn to live with loss. My hell time began on a summer night in 2009 while wrapping brownies at the kitchen table in our Maine farmhouse.Fifteen years earlier my husband and I gave up fame and fortune to raise our son and daughter on a Maine farm. We wanted them to grow up with the respectful down-to-earth values of our small Maine town. We hoped they would shape deeply lived authentic lives surrounded by natural beauty and bound to the rhythms of the seasons. Our life was a celebration of long Huck Finn summers and cozy snowy winters. We created an 18th century household filled with books, music, and memories in which we all worked and played. It was our sanctuary -- the safest, happiest place on earth. Later our children taught us to be green. We installed windmills and solar panels, recycled and composted, and became more mindful of our footprint. Still, we felt safe from the worst ravages of global warming in our bucolic corner of the \"first\" world here in New England. The real catastrophes were \"out there\" in sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh, the Andes or tiny Pacific islands. Then global warming crashed our party in paradise.That night I thrilled to the thunderstorm raging outside. Then a bolt of lightning crashed through the kitchen window, mowed me down like a freight train hurtling through my chest and triggered a blast so loud I thought the sound barrier had been breached somewhere between the crockery and the curtains. When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the floor. Then came smoke. Fifteen minutes later we were out in the storm, watching in disbelief as our beloved home vanished in a towering wall of flame.I am not a climate change scientist, but I have come to understand that I am a climate change victim. Our daughter took the lead investigating destructive lightning in Maine. She found that the NASA Goddard Institute estimates a 5-6% change in global lightning frequencies for every 1 degree Celsius global warming. The Earth has already warmed .8 degrees Celsius since 1802 and is expected to warm another 1.1-6.4 degrees by the end of the century. Maine's temperatures rose 1.9 degrees Celsius in the last century and another 2.24 degree rise is projected by 2104. I learned from our insurance company that while the typical thunderstorm produces around 100 lightning strikes, there were 217 strikes around our house that night. I was shocked to discover that when it comes to increased lightning frequency and destructiveness, a NASA study concluded that eastern areas of North America like Maine are especially vulnerable. Scientists confirm a 10% increase in the incidence of extreme weather events in our region since 1949.Was the lightning bolt in our kitchen caused by global warming? The facts are too compelling to ignore. It seems that global warming turned my family into refugees in our own lives, stripped of everything that once carried our memories and meaning. Since then I've learned some lessons that may help others reckon with the realities of climate change and the terrifying prospect that our future will be different from our past.As thick smoke quickly filled the house, I had only a few minutes to do something. I ran upstairs, closing doors to protect the bedrooms from smoke damage. I ran back down and pulled photo albums off the living room shelves, tossing them on a sheltered porch. I was on my way for more when the fire marshal arrived. He pulled me back, shouting over the din of rain and thunder and ordered me away.What was I thinking! There was so much I could have rescued in those minutes! Instead I closed doors to rooms that would no longer be. I sheltered precious photos on a porch soon to disappear. I acted as though our home faced a temporary assault -- a blip and a return to baseline. It never occurred to me that my status quo confronted a mortal threat and could be extinguished forever. My mind did not conceive that in a few hours everything we had worked for and cherished would no longer exist.I committed a cognitive error that I call \"the error of predictability.\" It is the deeply ingrained tendency of every living system -- from the human brain to microorganisms to complex societies -- to operate as though the near future will follow from the near past. As a social scientist I have studied this pattern for decades. I've pored over control room transcripts in which operators ignored catastrophic data, preferring to think \"bad instruments\" rather than \"CATACLYSM!\" I have worked closely with hundreds of adults in crisis struggling to cope with change. I've consulted with companies reluctant to let go of the past. The morning of the fire I completed work for a chapter in my new book. The title? The Error of Predictability. Apparently knowledge did not inoculate me from this error.Since that night I've been on an inner search for an antidote to the error and discovered a special kind of capability that I think of as \"the pivot.\" The mechanism of a pivot is paradoxical because it unites two opposites: the still point and the swivel. It's the fixed center that enables response across a broad range. The pivot is a way of holding yourself toward the future. It entails a self knowledge and resilience that run deeper than words, but also a flexibility that can adapt deftly to any situation. Think of a master tennis player holding herself still in readiness to return the serve but able to reach in any direction quickly and effectively. I've learned that no instant is ordinary. Each is replete with every potential from the miraculous to the catastrophic. Living with this attitude, I don't assume continuity. Now I try to stay open to the surprise within each moment -- and pivot.Climate change is not a blip but an epochal shift, yet we seem unable to do much more than close the doors to rooms bound for extinction. Are we in a countdown to a hell time of irreversible loss or to a renaissance of invention and adaptation? It depends on how we learn to pivot. Every level of the system -- from each person to the governments of the world -- can learn to understand and confront the error of predictability. Naming it and identifying its consequences is a start. Then let's learn how to teach our children, our leaders and ourselves what it means to live without terror in the knowledge that our planet is spinning on a new course.I thought I could keep my children safe in this peaceful place. Now I know that no one of us can keep our children safe. There is no shelter from the storm of global warming. All we can do is learn how to pivot and impart that soulful skill to those we love. Breed it in their bones that they may become agents of adaptive change in these new times. We are all just earth travelers now: many addresses but only one home."}, {"title": "Suppose You Could Actually See Climate Change?", "text": "That question has been nagging me since I did, when I looked at the following visual at last week's CERES 2012 Conference, \"Igniting Innovation, Scaling Sustainability.\"This is an image, derived from a pair of NASA satellites named \"Grace\", that shows the cumulative increase (red-green) or decrease in the amount of water on each part of the earth's surface from 2003-2009. You can actually see how the climate has changed, with the blue regions getting drier, and the red ones wetter.As Dr. Jay Famiglietta of UC Irvine, who flashed this image in front of us, put it, we are producing more rain, more evaporation, more stream flow -- and overall draining the continents of the water which makes ecosystems and civilization flourish. And unlike the weather, which is highly variable anyway, these water trends build up more slowly, even through wet and dry years, so we can easily tell that, yes, things are getting worse.This shouldn't be surprising. Storing heat in the atmosphere (aka global warming) means there is more energy in the climate system. Just as a saucepan at a rolling boil is more violent than one at a simmer, so our climate at 450 ppm CO2 will be more violent than it was at 225 ppm -- because CO2 stores heat, just like putting a lid on a saucepan brings it to a much higher boil.But climate scientists -- in the interest of knowledge -- tried to explain to us how they measured this phenomenon, with their complex computer models -- rather than pointing us to the easier to measure cumulative results of messing with atmospheric chemistry.The other obvious missed opportunity to rebut the cynical effort by the carbon lobby to keep the public from recognizing the clear and present danger posed by carbon pollution was a sufficient focus on ocean acidity. Here there is no dubious climate science, no doubters. More atmospheric CO2 = more acidic oceans. And you can measure the cumulative impact:The Heartland Institute, one of the more prominent and heavy-handed climate cynics, does claim that ocean acidification will be good for the oceans, making them \"less basic\" rather than \"more acid.\" Heartland quotes its allies as claiming that \"the net impact of twentieth century increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperature has not been anywhere near as catastrophically disruptive to Earth's marine organisms\" as marine biologists are worried about. But note the weasel words: \"anywhere near as catastrophically disruptive\" is a far cry from, \"no impact.\" More typically, another global warming cynic site tries to obscure the cumulative increase in ocean acidity by saying, well there are variable cycles all the time, so it can't matter. \"Some marine life can live through larger, faster swings than the apocalyptic predictions suggest, though of course, no one is suggesting that the entire global ocean would be happy with similar extreme swings.\" Reassured?While the carbon lobby will always, always claim that climate change is not really so bad, that's not what is lulling the public -- it's the uncertainty about whether it is already happening, which GRACE shows us clearly it is, and whether man-made emissions are the cause, which the ocean acidification data demonstrates beyond a doubt.Compare the visual impact of the GRACE photo with the following, important but hard to track report in Monday's New York Times, on the fact that the remaining major uncertainty being exploited by climate cynics is the real uncertainty about exactly how clouds might make climate change happen faster or more slowly. \"The scientific majority believes that clouds will most likely have a neutral effect or will even amplify the warming, perhaps strongly, but the lack of unambiguous proof has left room for dissent.\" This is true -- and taken in isolation, many readers might feel less concern reading it than they felt when they opened the paper. But in fact, this statement is not reassuring al all -- since even if, like climate cynics, you don't believe we can model climate very well, it is still equally likely that clouds will make things worse than that they will help us out. But without a visual to drive it home, without being able to see it, this story, like most on temperature variability, doesn't have the punch of a good picture -- like the one I saw at the CERES conference a few days ago.Maybe we can move public understanding along better if we spend less energy on debating the climate models, and the temperature variability, and more on the things -- like more energetic water flows, resulting in the overall drying out of the continents by the climate system, or more acid being absorbed in the ocean -- that increase gradually, over time, but whose dimensions are much harder to debate.A veteran leader in the environmental movement, Carl Pope is the former executive director and chairman of the Sierra Club.

Building on the success of her first book, That's Why We Don't Eat Animals, Roth offers a more detailed description of vegan living in Vegan is Love, complete with information for children to make cruelty-free choices at home, in school and in their communities.Some critics of Roth's book say it is inappropriate for children because of its subject matter and the book's references to animal testing, factory farm pollution and animal cruelty. Roth has been making the rounds on the air addressing the media \"controversy.\" This past week, I talked with her about what parents can expect from the book and how she developed its intriguing illustrations.With Vegan is Love you've gone more in depth on vegan life choices that children can make, from simply focusing on eating a vegan diet in That's Why We Don't Eat Animals (published in 2009) to making a choice to avoid zoos, circuses that use animals, choosing cruelty-free products, etc. When did you decide to take this message further and what age range do you believe the book is best suited for?The official age is seven and up, but I believe that children even younger can relate to the illustrations. Where my first book was about the \"why's\" of a plant-based lifestyle, Vegan Is Love is about the \"hows\" -- how to send our love across the world through the choices we make everyday. This book discusses the far-reaching impact of veganism. I wrote it because America has had a very hard time in the last couple of years. Instead of worrying or \"occupying,\" I decided to write this book for a new generation of children who will have to think, eat and live differently if we are to solve some of the world's most pressing issues.Are children ready to handle the responsibility of making the consumer choices you describe? Some reviewers say that the subject matter may be too \"controversial\"? What is your take on this?There is nothing more graphic in my book than what any child might see in a deli case or on the myriad fishing, hunting or cooking shows on TV. I think it's never too early to begin teaching your kids how to love deeply, think critically, and act responsibly. We do not give kids enough credit for their insight and ability to make inferences and draw conclusions. When we give kids the information they need to make educated choices, they choose wisely -- for health, animals and the environment. For example, if children are educated about animal testing, they are excited to help their parents look for cruelty-free logos at the grocery store. The PG versions of reality in my book are a child-friendly way to begin discussions.Your newest book is quite an empowering guide for young people, have you received any notable letters of admiration or support from young fans of your books?Absolutely! Parents around the world send me news about their children's thoughts and reactions to my books as well as the \"controversy\" in the media -- the notes are always hilarious and insightful. In response to the negative critique of Vegan is Love by a child psychologist on FOX, one mother told me her young vegan daughter said, \"Why is that expert so ignorant?\" I also have letters about the activism my book inspired -- children doing presentations, science projects and placing signs in their neighborhood about the benefits of veganism. Kids feel empowered by information.The subject matter of Vegan is Love is serious, but needn't be frightening to children who are ready to comprehend it. What were the biggest challenges you faced when creating the illustrations for the book? What was your creative process like when deciding on the look and feel of the book?Thank you, I've never once seen a child overwhelmed by my books -- only adults. The purpose of the text and illustrations is not to instill fear but inspire action. The animal testing spread, for example, shows only the most minor slice of the reality inside labs. To kids, the illustration appears simply as animals in cages, some with \"ouchies.\" Children don't have the context that adults do when we look at an image like this, which reminds of us exposed organs, syringes, restraints. I made sure every page was manageable for a child's capacity and contained an affirmation about action. The most important lesson for kids to learn is that we don't have to fear anything we have the power to change.For more information on Ruby Roth's books visit http://www.wedonteatanimals.com/"}, {"title": "Plants' Reactions To Climate Change Examined In New Study", "text": "* Plants flowering 8.5 times faster than predicted* Changes have knock-on effect for food chain, ecosystemsBy Nina ChestneyLONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Plants are flowering faster than scientists predicted in response to climate change, research in the United States showed on Wednesday, which could have devastating knock-on effects for food chains and ecosystems.Global warming is having a significant impact on hundreds of plant and animal species around the world, changing some breeding, migration and feeding patterns, scientists say.Increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels can affect how plants produce oxygen, while higher temperatures and variable rainfall patterns can change their behaviour.\"Predicting species' response to climate change is a major challenge in ecology,\" said researchers at the University of California San Diego and several other U.S. institutions.They said plants had been the focus of study because their response to climate change could affect food chains and ecosystem services such as pollination, nutrient cycles and water supply.The study, published on the Nature website, draws on evidence from plant life cycle studies and experiments across four continents and 1,634 species. It found that some experiments had underestimated the speed of flowering by 8.5 times and growing leaves by 4 times.\"Across all species, the experiments under-predicted the magnitude of the advance - for both leafing and flowering - that results from temperature increases,\" the study said.The design of future experiments may need to be improved to better predict how plants will react to climate change, it said.Plants are essential to life on Earth. They are the base of the food chain, using photosynthesis to produce sugar from carbon dioxide and water. They expel oxygen which is needed by nearly every organism which inhabits the planet.Scientists estimate the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1900, and nearly 0.2 degrees per decade since 1979.So far, efforts to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases are not seen as sufficient to prevent the Earth heating up beyond 2 degrees C this century - a threshold scientists say risks an unstable climate in which weather extremes are common, leading to drought, floods, crop failures and rising sea levels.The study can be viewed at http://www.nature.com/nature (Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"}, {"title": "Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake Energy CEO, Says He's 'Deeply Sorry'", "text": "* CEO says deeply sorry for distractions of the past two weeks* CEO says there has been a lot of misinformation* Shares suffer biggest 1-day fall in more than three years (Adds analyst and investor comments, updates stock price)By Matt Daily and Anna DriverMay 2 (Reuters) - Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp posted their largest decline in more than three years as Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the turmoil caused by his personal financial dealings.McClendon is under fire over investigations by Reuters into his personal financial dealings. He characterized many of the reports as \"misinformation,\" without elaborating.\"There's been enormous and unprecedented scrutiny of our company, and of me personally. And a great deal of misinformation has been published, and uncertainty created,\" McClendon told analysts on an earnings conference call on Wednesday.Chesapeake shares were down nearly 14 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon, the stock's largest decline in more than three years.McClendon did not offer specifics, and analysts did not press him on the Reuters reports that showed he had taken out as much as $1.1 billion in personal loans on ownership stakes in wells the company had given to him. Analysts and academics have said those stakes posed potentially serious conflicts of interest.On Wednesday, a new Reuters investigation found that McClendon also ran a $200 million hedge fund that was registered at Chesapeake's Oklahoma City office from 2004 to 2008 and traded in the same commodities Chesapeake produces.\"Obviously there is a lot of noise going on personally with management,\" said Neal Dingmann, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, referring to the stock decline.Investors were also likely disappointed that the company produced more low-cost natural gas than expected in the first quarter, among other factors, the analyst said.Chesapeake said on Tuesday it would replace McClendon as chairman and bring to an early end its controversial \"Founders Well Participation Program\" that gave him stakes in each of the company's wells. The program will run through June 2014, ending 18 months earlier than originally planned.Chesapeake's largest shareholder, Memphis-based Southeastern Asset Management, will be involved in the search for a nonexecutive chairman.\"We will participate in the process of finding a new nonexecutive chairman,\" G. Stanley Cates, Southeastern's president, said Tuesday at his fund's shareholder meeting.\"The bottom line is, there are positives and negatives of partnering with McClendon, as with anybody, and in our opinion the positives strongly outweigh the negatives, and the negatives have been very actively addressed,\" Cates said.The well program has come under the scrutiny of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service in the wake of the Reuters reports.McClendon, who co-founded the company, also offered a rare apology for the recent controversy.\"I am deeply sorry for all the distractions of the past two weeks. Through all of this I've learned that there was a desire for more information regarding the FWP program,\" he said.Chesapeake, like other natural gas producers, has suffered as prices for the fuel have tumbled to their lowest levels in a decade as output from shale fields surged, swelling inventories even as a warm winter trimmed seasonal demand.The company said it had curtailed natural gas production during the first quarter, and it was quickly moving to increase its output of oil and other liquids.After the market close on Tuesday, Chesapeake reported a first-quarter net loss as it took a noncash charge based on a lower market value for its hedges. Excluding items, the company earned 18 cents a share, well short of the 29 cents expected on average by analysts.Shares of Chesapeake were down 13.5 percent at $16.96 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

It is one thing, for example, to offer paperless banking as a means of satisfying the eco-conscious consumer, but it requires a much higher degree of commitment to, say, discontinue financing of mountaintop removal (MTR) as a means of extracting coal.On April 23, Wells Fargo announced an enhanced commitment to environmental leadership through a series of goals to be achieved by 2020 including: $30 billion in loans and investments in support of a \"greener\" economy, $100 million in community grants for grassroots environmental initiatives, and a 40 percent increase in the company's energy efficiency. With these ambitious targets, Wells is indeed showing a commitment to investing in a green economy.Underlying these targets, however, is the signal of a much larger shift in how the bank approaches its lending practices -- one that is both strategic and transparent in nature.Although Wells Fargo has never been seen as a major culprit in financing strip mining and dirty coal energy (PNC, Citi and UBS take the title on that front), they have nonetheless identified the need to modify their approach to what is increasingly becoming a poster child for global climate change. To this end, the company earns modest points for what it calls environmental and socially responsible lending.The new approach outlined for coal and metal mining, for instance, requires an \"enhanced due diligence process, including evaluation of a company's track record regarding litigation, regulatory compliance, worker safety and environmental compliance -- and the degree of organizational capacity and commitment the company dedicates to these concerns.\"This signals a more head-on approach to what has traditionally been considered a taboo subject. Sure coal is dirty and bad for the climate, but the reality of having any renewable energy source take its place in the near term is illogical. What Wells is attempting to do is say, \"OK, we realize that there are certain negative drawbacks to financing coal, so we'll take more precautions, but there is still enough of a business case for us to do it.\"In a report released late last year entitled \"Bankrolling Climate Change: A Look into the Portfolios of the World's Largest Banks,\" Wells Fargo was ranked 19 out of 93 major banks with $5.9 billion of financing in coal mining and coal fired electricity from 2005 to 2011.To whatever degree Wells has invested in coal fired energy in the past, now there seems to be a conscious change of tact in how they go about it with their latest environmental commitments. In a statement regarding their environmental affairs, the company has stated:Wells Fargo seeks to ensure that as we do business, natural resources are protected and environmental, social and economic needs are part of our everyday decisions. In this integrated approach to sustainability, we are committed to finding new ways to minimize our energy consumption, address climate change, use renewable sources, and inspire others to do the same so we can lower our impact on the planet.Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization that rates companies on their climate leadership, most recently scored Wells Fargo at a \"starting\" 49 out of 100 points.In terms of sniff test, Wells Fargo may not smell the best, but their investments in a green economy are absolutely a step in the right direction."}, {"title": "France Greenpeace Activist Paraglides, Throws Smoke Flare Onto Nuclear Plant", "text": "* Greenpeace enters nuclear site, drops smoke flare* Intrusion just days before presidential runoff* France's high use of nuclear is issue in campaign* Man entered Civaux plant's security zone (Adds separate intrusion, details)PARIS, May 2 (Reuters) - A Greenpeace activist dropped a smoke flare as he flew over a French nuclear reactor on a paraglider on Wednesday, seeking to draw attention to what green activists call gaps in nuclear security four days before a presidential election runoff.The plant's owner, EDF, confirmed an engine-powered paraglider had landed within its Bugey nuclear site in southeastern France.The pilot flew over the plant and threw a red-smoke flare on the roof of a building before landing, television images showed.\"At no moment was the safety of the installations at risk,\" EDF said in a statement, adding that the pilot was caught by the police in charge of protecting the site.Separately, another man entered the Civaux nuclear site in southwestern France through the truck gate and remained hidden for an hour in a thicket in the \"surveillance zone\" before being arrested, EDF said.France's dependence on nuclear energy has been much debated ahead of the vote. France is more dependent on nuclear energy than any other country, relying on it to produce 75 percent of its electricity.\"This overflight shows the vulnerability of the French nuclear site to an air attack,\" Sophia Majnoni d'Intignano, in charge of nuclear questions at Greenpeace, said in a statement.\"While Germany took account of a plane crash in its safety tests, France still refuses to analyse this risk for our reactors.\"Similarly, in December, Greenpeace activists entered the Nogent-sur-Seine plant near Paris, climbing onto one of the domes that houses a reactor, while other activists entered other nuclear installations.Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande has said he would shut France's oldest nuclear plant if elected.After the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, France along with other European countries, pledged to carry out safety tests on its 58 nuclear reactors to test their capacity to resist flooding, earthquakes, power outages, failure of the cooling systems and operational management of accidents.But those did not include terrorist attacks, or the possibility of a plane crash.

Day after day, families in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee continue to suffer from damaged homes, polluted air and water, and threats to their health caused by mountaintop removal.It's important to remember that these attacks on Appalachia's mountains and communities don't just come from coal companies, but also from the banks that finance these operations. Banks with household names are complicit in polluting our air and water, threatening the health of Appalachian families, and destroying our natural heritage.That's why today the Rainforest Action and Sierra Club are releasing a report detailing the five filthiest banks in our third annual \"Coal Finance Report Card.\" This year, we looked at not only financing of mountaintop removal, but also at financing of the coal fired power plants that are our nation's biggest source of the sulfur pollution that harms our health, the mercury pollution that harms our children, and the carbon pollution that harms our planet.The report looks at the stated policies for mountaintop removal and coal financing from each of the largest U.S. banks and assigns a letter grade to how well they uphold these policies based on investments, transactions, and ownership of coal mining and coal burning utility companies.Here are the worst of the worst:My colleague at RAN states it well: \"These banks are the ATMs for a dirty industry that is bad for health and bad for business,\" said Amanda Starbuck, Director of RAN's Energy and Finance Program. \"Coal is the ultimate subprime investment for the climate.\"We're not the only organizations seeing the problem with financial organizations investing in dirty energy. This week also marks a huge 200-mile march across Pennsylvania by a coalition of groups hoping PNC Bank (headquartered in Pennsylvania) will stop financing mountaintop removal coal mining. Spread-headed by the Earth Quaker Action Team, the walk is part of their fantastic \"Bank Like Appalachia Matters\" campaign.Through today's report, Sierra Club and RAN are not only pointing out where banks are failing as energy and climate leaders, but also we are reaffirming our strong commitment to work with the companies to adopt and implement meaningful policies on coal.Protecting the health and safety of our families is everyone's responsibility - including those that fund this destructive and dirty practice. We hope this report card helps draw attention and scrutiny to those who are bankrolling some of the biggest polluters in our country."}, {"title": "Imitating Nature: Engineering's Sincerest Form of Efficiency", "text": "Energy efficiency has often been called the \"low-hanging fruit\" of our battle against climate change. An appropriate metaphor, as Climate Progress's Joe Romm points out, because energy efficiency \"grows back.\"\"The efficiency resource never gets exhausted because technology keeps improving and knowledge spreads to more and more people,\" says Romm.In fact, energy efficiency and conservation make up four wedges in the Carbon Mitigation Initiative's Stabilization Wedges game. The CMI is a joint effort of Princeton University, BP and Ford Motor company and its Wedges game lets players try different strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 200 billion tons in the next 50 years.But energy efficiency has more going for it than some game pieces and the \"hanging fruit\" catch phrase. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company says current (or soon-to-be) energy efficiency technology could do much of the heavy lifting in reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 80% below 1990 levels within 40 years.And here's some more good news: When engineers, designers and scientists seek to develop energy efficient solutions, they need not look far for inspiration. Biomimicry is a new field which asks its practitioners to identify a human need for efficiency and design a solution that mimics nature's solution to a comparable challenge. Why? As the Biomimicry Institute explains:The core idea is that nature, imaginative by necessity, has already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers. They have found what works, what is appropriate, and most important, what lasts here on Earth. This is the real news of biomimicry: After 3.8 billion years of research and development, failures are fossils, and what surrounds us is the secret to survival.Think the Biomimicry Institute is overstating the case? Consider the fact that the United States still relies on bees to pollinate about a third of its crops. Consider, too, that this arrangement is not just happenstance. Plenty of those bees are not native to the area so farmers work with commercial beekeepers to supply the little buzzers. That's a bummer, since bee populations are in trouble these days.Technology from WhalePower Corporation was the inspiration for today's comic strip. The designs for WhalePower's fan blades were inspired by the bumps on humpback whale flippers which are well-suited to deal with fluid dynamics.Clustering wind turbines close together does not seem like a good idea, but the California Institute of Technology's Center for Bioinspired Engineering looked to the spatial arrangements of schooling fish to position their vertical wind turbines. The results so far? Ten times the efficiency.For a glimpse at more bioinspired designs that range from artificial muscles to a robot spider that nimbly locates disaster victims, take a look at these galleries from National Geographic and Treehugger.So what's the moral of this story?

Today the New York Times printed a cover story about the last arrow in the climate skeptics arsenal, the argument that cloud cover will adjust to a warming world and let more heat escape to space.The science of cloud cover is important for understanding how our climate will change and how fast, but the scientific debate here isn't actually the point. The big problem with this article, and nearly every other discussion of climate change, is that it rests on a deeply false premise: the idea that tackling climate change will just cost too much. This is hogwash.It does not cost more to reduce carbon emissions; it costs less. Companies, consumers, and countries save money when they reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Study after study -- and the constant experience of companies saving billions in eco-efficiency -- prove this point over and over.Some great books cover this terrain well. See Climate Capitalism by Hunter Lovins and Boyd Cohen, for example. Or explore the latest data-rich entry into the canon of eco-savings from one of its founding fathers, Amory Lovins. Just peruse the executive summary of his latest book, Reinventing Fire for the calculations.We can cut out huge quantities of carbon from our economy while saving literally trillions of dollars at a high IRR by investing in energy efficiency -- just looking at the built environment, buildings have nearly $2 trillion of untapped savings over the coming decades at an IRR of 33%. (For this story at the microeconomic level, watch this video of Tony Malkin, owner of the Empire State Building, talking about the business benefits of the energy retrofit of the world's most iconic building -- a 38% cut in energy use, less than three-year payback, higher rents from tenants.)And none of these purely fiscal calculations include the significant health and national security benefits, which alone are enough to justify a quick exit from a carbon-based economy.So it's absurd, yet not shocking, that the Times lets two seemingly damning quotes in the article go completely unchallenged. First, GOP Congressman Dana Rohrabacher: \"There are people trying to tell us that we have got to accept draconian changes in our way of life.\" Second, the climate skeptic and self-proclaimed cloud cover savior featured in this article, Dr. Lindzen: \"If I'm right, we'll have saved money by avoiding measures to limit emissions.\"Very few people are looking for \"draconian\" changes at this point -- radically more efficiency perhaps. But explain to me how insulated buildings with top-notch windows that make us more comfortable at far lower cost... or cars using no oil and causing no money to go to petro-dictators abroad... constitute threats to our way of life? Still, Rohrbacher is right to some extent but not how he intends: the longer we listen to naysayers like him and avoid making smart investments in our future, the harder the change will be. We will most certainly face draconian changes if we wait any longer. And Lindzen's comment that we'll save money by continuing to pump carbon, which is a waste product, into the atmosphere is just false.Let's be clear: These denier statements are big, fat, ugly, dangerous, and very expensive lies.(Cross-posted from Andrew Winston's Blog)"}, {"title": "A Poem for the Marcellus", "text": "In praise of unfractured rock.Everywhere is holy. -- Allen Ginsberg, \"Footnote to Howl,\" Howl, and Other PoemsIn honor of both National Poetry Month and Earth Day -- and with thanks to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who continues to inspire me -- I offer below a love song to the bedrock: the methane-suffused shale that geologists call the Marcellus, which now lies in the crosshairs of the oil and gas industry.By way of prelude: The Marcellus Shale is the geological foundation of upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The namesake for this underground layer of rock is the village of Marcellus, New York. The village, in turn, is named for the ancient Roman general, Marcus Claudius Marcellus. Renowned for his cunning military strategies, General Marcellus ultimately perished on the battlefield, run through by a spear. Marcellus reappears as a character in Hamlet (where being run through is a not uncommon cause of death). In Shakespeare's telling, Marcellus is a career officer who utters the memorable line about Denmark.Geologically speaking, the Marcellus Shale represents an ancient seafloor. The bubbles of natural gas trapped within it are the remains of marine organisms. The Marcellus also contains heavy metals, radioactive elements, sea salt, and carcinogenic vapors, including benzene. When the shale is run through -- fractured, fracked -- for natural gas extraction, these substances are liberated and brought to the earth's surface.Carbon-rich geological formations are also living ecosystems. They are the home to relic organisms collectively called \"deep life.\" Some of these microbes form complex colonies, sending nanowires out into the surrounding rock for purposes of electron transfer. Deep-life organisms are ubiquitous and almost certainly play a role in the Earth's carbon cycle. They may, in ways we do not yet understand, contribute to climate stability.Living organisms also interfere with the flow of gas through pipelines. To prevent this biofouling, gas companies send powerful biocides into the shale, killing everything that inhabits it. The use of biocides, among other factors, makes fracking a highly toxic form of energy extraction.As a biologist, I've written extensively about the toxicity of fracking. As a poet, I'm interested in it, too. I'm often asked what biology and poetry have in common. The answer for me is that both biology and poetry are about the mystery of being alive. But whereas biology wants to solve the mystery, poetry simply says, behold.If you like this poem, take it with you. Read it aloud at public hearings, at rallies, in church.

Sitting here in India's sixth largest city, Pune, there is evidence of deep transformation since the last United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio, in 1992. The last time around, in the Rio Declaration, people were placed at the center for sustainable development. And poverty was identified as an obstacle to sustainable development. These years later, one group of the poor -- wastepickers -- have organized as the Global Alliance of Waste Pickers. They are meeting at Pune for a workshop. Wastepickers are a widespread phenomenon in the developing world, and seen only occasionally elsewhere. They rummage through trash and pick out plastics, paper, cardboards and metals, selling these to waste dealers who finally sell it to factories that will recycle these materials. These wastepickers are demanding a place of honor within the green economy -- a key theme is this year's Rio+20 meet.The green economy is a term people either love or hate. Its critics interpret it as a system that expands existing economic systems via businesses such as GM, or mass harvesting of natural resources at the cost of protecting people and the planet. Those invested in the idea see it as an economy that acknowledges the services and needs of the poor with benefits accrued directly to them. For them, the green economy also means of non-hazardous work, breaking out of poverty and enjoying one's basic rights. This is what the wastepickers, gathered here in Pune, all seem to collectively want -- to participate in the kind of green economy they'd vote for. Unfortunately, most of them remain untouched by this idea. It's a tragic indicator of the state of the developing world's cities that from Mali to Argentina, the world's recyclers recount being excluded from city waste handling systems, and public humiliations, before some of them describe their relatively recent success. Cities, we realize, a whole generation after Rio, still remain severely unequal and cruel to the poor. Even towards wastepickers, their best recyclers, who save significant greenhouse gas emissions.Still, wastepickers share their aspirations. Esther Kosi from Ghana, a landfill based wastepicker, she also sews theatre costumes when she is commissioned. From her work on Accra's dumps, she has brought up four children. The oldest, at 26, is educated and currently between jobs. \"We don't have a relationship with people whose waste we recycle -- we have to built it up,\" she points out. Maria Christina from Argentina, representing a local co-op, El Ceibo, understands people differently. \"We need to reclaim ourselves before we reclaim waste,\" she announces. Her sentiments are widely applauded, because the wastepickers all call for being better organized.There are some causes for celebrations. In metro Manila, the local municipality has helped the wastepickers to pick the recyclables they want and even convert plastics into high value pellets. In Pune, the SWACH co-operative picks up waste at the doorstep from over 45 percent of the city, creating green jobs. In Delhi, Safai Sena similarly picks waste from the New Delhi area but also collects toxic electronic waste, diverting it to clean recyclers.This is what an important part of the green economy looks like then -- propelled by small or medium organizations, operationalized under safe conditions by skilled wastepickers and addressing one of the world's more pressing environmental challenges. Many of these ideas were nascent in 1992. But Rio+20 must take note and embrace this model of a green economy. Over 20 million people on the planet are asking for it."}, {"title": "Think of Your Neighbor on Earth First Before You Reach Neptune", "text": "Human wisdom always led us to explore secrets of our universe. In fact, it is the power of knowledge and science that living on the Earth that we can know how big and far our solar system is within the unimagined boundaries of the universe. Studying our solar system can take a human being into an awesome realization that science today completely dominates new horizons of development.How science and new developments expanded their wings to explore other worlds as compared to the well-being of our very Earth is a big question mark. Let's first see how sciences go above Earth!You might feel it as a journey of our solar system for a while and think about the power of science and development in today's world.A commercial cruising aircraft flies at a height of 13 km, where the limit of troposphere ends. A typical weather balloon flies at a height of 27 km, whereas the highest skydive so far has been made from the height of 31km.Stratosphere ends at 50km height and mesosphere at 90km.Beginning of low orbit starts at 160km. The international space station works at the height of 406km and hubble telescope exists at 598km.The limit of thermosphere ends at 600km and exosphere at 10,000km.2,000km is the end limit of low orbit and a communication satellite works at the height of 35,786km.Magnetosphere ends at the height of 50,000km.Now let's go further up. The distance Asteroid 2005YU55 passed from the Earth in November 2011 and was 324,600km, while our moon is at the distance of 384,000km from the Earth. The farthest travel a human could do till now from Earth is 400,000km.Wouldn't it be interesting to go millions and billions of kilometers further? Human wisdom not only discovered that our Sun lies at the distance of 149.6m km but also could be able to send a mission Voyager 1 probe at the distance of 17.94b km, which is the farthest man-made object beyond the Pluto and Neptune.The heliosphere ends at the distance of 21.24b km, which is the outer edges of our own solar system!Going through this wonderful journey of human success and development far in stars, the reality is that our solar system is still one of the tiny parts of the universe. Science continues to explore the secrets of universe expansions.Today, we rejoice that our science and development has gone beyond the boundaries, which is unbelievable and amazing. However, achieving all those successes, did we ever think of a moment about those people who live just as close to us on Earth? How new science thinks of the extremely poor who are starving on Earth or those who have become more vulnerable to extreme weather events than the past?Perhaps we have gone too far along with our so-called development but forgot the challenges and protection of our mother Earth. Today we see people living with hunger, poverty and diseases. Today our Earth faces the challenges of global warming and extreme weather events. Can the advanced science help the poor to protect from the impacts of climate change?We do celebrate Earth Day every year, however we perhaps forget that our Earth also asks us to recall our responsibilities and take action to protect our Earth from the on-going global pollution. Did we ever think we, the entire world, emit 90 million tons of CO2 every day? It would be good for science to reach up to Neptune. Let's also think how good we are for our neighbors."}, {"title": "Bike Fever", "text": "Long days and warm temperatures make May the best month for bicycling in most of the United States. Appropriately, it's the designated National Bike Month. Independent of all weather trends, this May and this summer should be an amazing time for bicycling in America. Let me offer a few quick reasons.  During the last decade, the federal government, states, cities and towns have invested in bike lanes and paths as never before. The result? Bicycling is becoming safer and stress-free in more communities. More people -- including new and inexperienced riders -- now feel comfortable on two wheels.  Bicycling in many big U.S. cities has more than doubled in the last five years. Bikeways, including the new development of green lanes separated from motor vehicle traffic, are being built all over the country -- as are more bike paths, bike bridges and dirt trails. Safe Routes to School programs have been implemented in more than 12,000 U.S. schools. Automated, short-term bike rental systems will debut this summer in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and are already in place in Denver, Boston, Washington and dozens of other cities.  New, appealing places to ride coupled with convenient rental stations that offer solid, reliable and cheap bikes: that's a winning combination. So is paying special attention to the needs of eight-year-olds and 80-year-olds: that's how we make our communities better for everyone.  High gas prices this year have motivated thousands of Americans to think hard about alternatives. While most of our daily commutes are too long to pedal round-trip every day, we make plenty of other short trips that can easily be managed on two wheels. Pedal two miles (instead of drive) and you save at least a buck. Do it more often, and you save a lot. Half the trips that Americans make are three miles or less: we have so many possibilities.  More Americans now realize that when people ride bikes, great things happen. To start, bike riding cuts road congestion, helps preserve air quality and counters the obesity crisis that is weighing heavily on our nation's fiscal health. Riding a bike can be a simple (dare I say, patriotic?) way to take personal responsibility and reduce our national dependence on foreign oil. The simple fact is that when you ride a bike, you feel better.  The list of bike benefits is long, but we all know that bike riding remains far from easy or comfortable in many of the places we live and work.  Here's the good news: an increasing percentage of our national leaders recognize bicycling as a simple solution for transportation challenges, jobs and economic development and health and obesity issues.  Two springs ago, we launched a new national movement called PeopleForBikes.org to show elected officials that Americans revere bicycling and want it to be safe and stress-free. More than a half million people have rallied behind this cause by signing a simple pledge at PeopleForBikes.org. I encourage you to join us.  Warm weather will come and go. But meanwhile, the simple idea that bicycling is a great activity that more Americans can safely enjoy is here to stay."}, {"title": "Queen Bees Are Demanding some R-E-S-P-E-C-T, Fool!", "text": "Photo Courtesy of Annie's Annuals and PerennialsThough worldwide bee health has been on the decline since the 1990s, it wasn't until the fall of 2006 that beekeepers nationwide began noticing millions of bees vanishing from their hives. This syndrome, named Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD, is characterized by the disappearance of adult honey bees from the hive, leaving the newborns to fend for themselves. Ever since, researchers worldwide have been scrambling to discover why bees are dying in record numbers. If you're not a huge fan of the bee, why should this matter to you? Well, if you like to eat food, you should be concerned.Besides gathering nectar to produce honey, bees pollinate agricultural crops, home gardens, orchards and wildlife habitat. As they travel from blossom to blossom in search of nectar, pollen sticks to their furry body and is transferred to another flowering blossom enabling it to swell into a ripened fruit. Bees have been doing this (for free!) for nearly 100 million years.Almonds, avocadoes, blueberries, cantaloupes, cherries, cranberries, cucumbers, watermelon and many other best-selling crops all rely on honey bees for pollination. It's estimated that about one-third of the human diet is derived from insect-pollinated plants and three-quarters of all plants on the planet depend on insects or animals for pollination.\"Most scientists now believe that we have been losing more than a third of our hives each year since 2006 from a combination of factors: pathogens, pesticides and nutritional stress,\" says Heather Pilatic, co-director at Pesticide Action Network. \"The debate has lately been over which is the more critical catalyst, and in the last year pesticides have rapidly risen to the top.\"(Ta-da! I could have so told you that! In fact, I think I did in my book, Talking Dirt: The Dirt Diva's Down-to-Earth Guide to Organic Gardening (Penguin, 2010).)\"Despite science that shows a key part of the problem is increased exposure to a class of systemic pesticides (neonicotinoids), policymakers and the pesticide industry have failed to act. The main question now is whether EPA will take action on a timeline that matters,\" says Pliatic. \"EPA is currently reviewing the pesticide clothianidin. Their current plan of issuing a decision in 2018 that will then take five more years to implement clearly does not meet that test.\"2018! We're all gonna starve by then! What the hell are they smoking over there? Can't we listen to science? According to Pesticide Action Network, three different recent studies confirm that low-level exposures to neonicotinoids with a common pathogen to dramatically increase bees' susceptibility to infection and the likelihood of death.Artwork courtesy of Maggie Agro\"In one long-awaited study Italian researchers have proven, yet again, that in a single flight over freshly-sown corn fields, bees can be exposed to neonicotinoid-contaminated dust from planters depositing treated seeds at acutely toxic levels,\" says Pilatic. \"This means they die right away. These same researchers have shown in 2010 and 2011 that sub-lethal exposures impair bees' learning and memory.\"Another new study released in Science shows that honeybees foraging and homing abilities were disrupted by sub-lethal (not sufficient to cause death) neonicotinoid exposure. And a Harvard study found that after exposure to one neonicotinoid called imidacloprid, 94 percent of the hives died.The really scary part is that neonicotinoid pesticides are systemic, which means they are present in every part of a treated plant and long-lasting in our soil. Which means pesticide residue travels into our groundwater, into our food and into our bodies.Sigh, Rachel Carson must be turning in her grave at our negligence. (Don't know who Rachel Carson is? Google it. Then read her best-selling book Silent Spring, where Carson, a marine biologist, wrote 50 years ago, \"Can anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life? They should not be called 'insecticides,' but 'biocides.'\")\"These new studies strengthen the case that pesticides are indeed a driving force behind CCD,\" says Pilatic. \"And these come on the heels of a year of strong science clearly showing that these pesticides are making bees sick, disrupting critical neurobehavioral patterns like foraging, learning and homing, and indeed, killing bees who may happen to fly over one of our 90+ million acres of freshly planted corn. We know enough to act -- if we didn't a year ago, we certainly do now. It is past time for EPA to take decisive action to protect pollinators.\"How can you be part of the solution? Glad you asked.Beyond Pesticides has teamed up with Pesticide Action Network to bring you their Honey Bee Haven, where you can map out your own bee friendly turf, and sign up for periodic updates on the honeybees. Visit www.honeybeehaven.orgThen, think about losing your lawn. 11 percent of all U.S. pesticide use is in lawns. Lawns are sterile, useless, water-guzzling bio-systems!

It gives me immense pleasure to create a world in my yard and then enjoy it (usually while drinking coffee in the morning on a couch outside, gazing fondly on all my trees, plants, birds, and rocks). The pulse-quickening thrill of going to a good plant nursery and garden shop is probably equivalent to a guy going to the Superbowl when his favorite team is playing. Well, of all the nurseries I've been to, Terrain at Styer's is my favorite, so don't even try to talk to me when I'm shopping because I am focusing, focusing, focusing. Places like Terrain are the main reason I own a pickup truck.Terrain is the brainchild of Dick Hayne, who also founded Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. When I first heard he was opening a nursery, I was intrigued but a bit skeptical. Then, friends and family started raving about it. And then, I went.Sigh.My first trip there was with Organic Gardening Editor Ethne Clarke and my sister Heidi, and we were going to meet John Kinsella (Terrain's managing director) for a tour. After getting lost (Don't ask, but let's just say I RARELY get lost, so maybe someone gave me bad directions?), we parked the truck and here's what I said (or something like it): \"You ladies take the tour and meet with John, but there is nothing--NOTHING, I tell you--that's going to stop me from buying lots of plants right now.\" I'm rarely rude, so this just goes to show how unreasonable I can be when it comes to buying plants. And I bought a lot of them that day.But it's not just plants at Terrain.... It's stuff to decorate the garden--lanterns, furniture, pillows, statues--huge stuff, tiny stuff, soaps and jewelry, a restaurant! And none of it is that cheap mass-manufactured-looking stuff that you get at big box stores. It all looks personal, intimate, quality, authentic. (Which is not to say it is or isn't, but it sure looks it!)The last time I went was last summer. I had taken a day off from work, and it was literally 105 degrees and 90 percent humidity. And I ran into Dick Hayne himself. OK, I did make an exception and stop to talk to him. We talked about hydrangeas and how plants go in and out of style, how one decade hydrangeas are cheesy and excessive and the next (or that day, right now), they simply Must Be Had--the more old-fashioned and authentic the better. I bought two giant ones.I'm due for a trip this year. I'll go soon. Lucky for all of us, we can also shop online at shopterrain.com. Even luckier, they have offered YOU a chance to win a $500 gift certificate to use either at the nursery or online.

South Korea is the world's fifth largest oil importer and the number two buyer of liquefied natural gas after Japan, so curbing energy imports would bring big savings.The programme, due to start Jan 2015, opens the possibility of international collaborations as part of a global effort to curb the growth of carbon pollution that scientists blame for heating up the planet and triggering more chaotic weather.To meet the mandatory cap, firms usually trade emissions permits or buy carbon offsets from overseas to manage their carbon liabilities.Europe has the world's largest emissions trading programme, Australia's carbon pricing scheme will start in July, while New Zealand's is already operating. Last week, the Australian government said it was exploring carbon trading links with South Korea.China has announced 7 pilot carbon market regions, though international links are unclear.COST CONCERNSFinal details of South Korea's programme are still to be worked out but the latest draft says it would likely cover 60 percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. It focuses on industrial operations producing more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year.The nation's top industry body has fought against the scheme saying it would add unnecessary costs and that competitor Japan has yet to put a price on carbon.The Federation of Korean Industries has said the scheme would cause additional initial costs of 4.7 trillion Korean won ($4.16 billion) even when 95 percent of pollution permits are given for free.Each permit represents a tonne of carbon emissions, with free permits awarded during the scheme's two first phases, spanning 2015-2017 and 2018-2020. The rest would be auctioned.The government says the scheme is crucial to reining in emissions from Asia's fourth largest economy, which have doubled since 1990. The government says the scheme is needed to meet a pledged goal of reducing emissions by 30 percent from projected levels by 2020.\"The opposition had no reason to oppose as they have been supporting the bill. Industry should be the one that's mostly worried about the outcome,\" Heo Seong-wook, Professor of Law from Seoul National University, told Reuters, referring to the country's powerful industrial conglomerates called chaebols.Yet despite their political clout, objections from industry have not swayed lawmakers, Heo said, in part because of ongoing talks among political leaders to try to rein-in big corporates.\"The parties might be concerned that, if they actively support industry's opinion, they might be seen as not so friendly towards ordinary people,\" Heo said.Many Korean firms, particularly big exporters remain unconvinced but have nonetheless been preparing, analysts say.Top emitters include major employers such as POSCO , the world's No.3 steelmaker, and Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest electronics firm by revenue.\"The news of carbon emission trading would not come as an immediate shock to the steel industry as steel makers have prepared for the scheme,\" an analyst at Daishin Securities, Mun Jeoung-up, said.Another analyst at Hanwha Securities, Kim Kang-o, said: \"If the cost burden accounts for a certain percentage of operating profits, that is a problem...Whether the industry would pass on the cost to consumers is also an important factor.\" ($1 = 1,128 Korean won) (Reporting by Meeyoung Cho, Eunhye Shin and Eun Jee Park; editing by David Fogarty and Keiron Henderson)"}, {"title": "'Green Bullet' Innovations To Address Soaring Population And Climate Change", "text": "By Laurie GoeringLONDON, May 2 (AlertNet) - In flood-hit fields in the Philippines, farmers are testing a hardy new variety of rice that can survive completely submerged for more than two weeks.In Kenya's Kibera slum, poor urban families are turning around their diets and incomes just by learning to grow vegetables in sack gardens outside their doors.And in India, a push to help marginalized rural communities gain title to their land is leading to a significant drop in hunger.These are just a few of the kinds of innovations and initiatives that experts say will be critical if the world is to feed itself over coming decades as the population soars, cities sprawl and climate change takes its toll.By 2050, the planet will need at least 70 percent more food than it does today to meet both an expected rise in population to 9 billion from 7 billion and changing appetites as many poor people grow richer, experts say.\"Can we feed a world of 9 billion? I would say the answer is yes,\" said Robert Watson, chief scientific adviser to Britain's Department of Environment and Rural Affairs and a former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.But doing so will require fundamental changes to unsustainable but well-entrenched policies and practices, from eating so much meat to spending trillions on agriculture and fuel subsidies, he said.In the meantime, many hunger fighters say the answer lies in clever alterations to the way food is planted, watered, harvested, stored, transported, sold, owned and shared.Many of those changes are already being tested in the world's farms and fields, in laboratories and government offices, in factories and markets. Some are even speaking of the beginnings of a 21st century food revolution.MYRIAD 'GREEN BULLETS'Unlike the last century's agricultural \"Green Revolution\", which dramatically boosted world food production with new high-yielding crop varieties and more irrigation, this revolution must rely on myriad \"green bullets\" to tackle hunger.They range from persuading farmers in Africa's drought zones to switch from water-hungry rice to hardier crops like sorghum or millet, to helping them build pest-proof grain silos that allow food to be stored longer or sold when prices are higher.With 70 percent of the world's people expected to live in cities by 2050, finding ways to help city dwellers grow food in small urban plots or roof gardens, or group together to buy food at cheaper prices, is a major focus.In California's East Palo Alto, for instance, older inner-city residents - who are particularly vulnerable to high food prices - are learning growing techniques for the first time and producing food for themselves and a neighborhood market.Other urban areas are turning to vertical hydroponic gardens clinging to the edge of skyscrapers.Women - who grow at least 40 percent of food in Africa and Asia - will need improved land rights and better access to information, something being made much easier by the spread of mobile phone technology, experts say.Rural women in India's Andhra Pradesh state now use advance drought warnings, relayed by Internet and mobile phone, to switch to more drought-tolerant crops -- a move that has saved harvests and helped stem the usual wave of migration to cities in drought times.Changing farming practices by adopting more water-conserving drip irrigation or planting crops amid fertilizing trees, as is now happening throughout Africa, will also be key.So will cutting the at least 30 percent of the world's food supply eaten by pests, spoiled on the way to market or thrown away unused from plates and supermarkets.Simply getting supermarkets to stop offering two-for-one specials - which can encourage people to overbuy - would be a start, some anti-hunger activists say, as would improving roads in regions like South Asia and Africa where transport delays mean produce often rots on the way to market.Solutions to the threat of worsening hunger will vary by region, by country, sometimes even from one farm or village or apartment building to the next, experts say. Not all ideas will succeed, and scaling up those that do prove to work, as quickly as possible, will be essential.In a world where an estimated 900 million people are already hungry today, curbing surging consumption in rich nations and those fast getting rich, especially India and China, will be particularly important, experts say.\"If we look at the graph of (rising) human consumption, that's the one to worry about,\" said Phil Bloomer, director of campaigns and policy for Oxfam Great Britain. \"That is a graph that should strike panic in our hearts.\"Persuading rich people to eat less meat and fewer milk products, which take a lot of grain to produce, would go a long way toward curbing ever-rising demand for grain.'NO NORMAL TO GO BACK TO'Many innovations focus on easing the adverse effects of climate change on food production.While warmer weather and growing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could spur plant growth and food production in some regions -- and open a few northern reaches of the world to farming -- many more regions are expected to see worsening losses from droughts, floods, storms, rising sea levels and higher temperatures that can cause crop yields to drop.\"It used to be there was an extreme weather event here or there but we knew that in a year or so things would go back to normal,\" said Lester Brown, a food security and sustainability expert, and president of the U.S.-based Earth Policy Institute.\"Now there is no normal to go back to.\"That's why scientists from Bangladesh to Tanzania are developing new resilient varieties of maize, wheat, rice and other crops that can survive underwater, or with very little rain, or even both extremes in the same season, and still produce a reliable crop.Other innovators are focusing on the effects of growing water scarcity.\"A substantial amount of our food production worldwide comes from non-renewable groundwater sources, and in the long run that is not sustainable,\" said Peter Gleick, a leading water expert and head of the U.S.-based Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security.In villages where glacier-fed streams are set to become more irregular or disappear in the years ahead, or where flooding from heavy rain is quickly followed by drought, communities are learning to harvest and store water to ensure supplies throughout the year.They are also developing water-conserving irrigation methods to make what they have available last.Will all such innovations be enough to feed 9 billion people by 2050? Possibly, say experts, but success will depend on making enough key changes fast enough.In addition to on-the-ground solutions, those changes will need to include major policy shifts -- including potentially a ban on turning grain into biofuel or limits on food speculation.\"Food insecurity and climate change are already inhibiting human well-being and economic growth throughout the world, and these problems are poised to accelerate,\" said John Beddington, Britain's chief science adviser, in a March report by the International Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change.\"Decisive policy action is required if we are to preserve the planet's capacity to produce adequate food in the future.\"(This story is part of a special multimedia report on global hunger produced by AlertNet, a global humanitarian news service run by Thomson Reuters Foundation)(Editing by Tim Large and Sonya Hepinstall)"}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - May 1, 2012", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport.The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!.IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Poll shows Americans want clean energy, and are willing to pay for it; Mitt Romney, unclear on the concept of overfishing; Meet the nation's newest oil spill, now in Louisiana; Study criticizes federal pipeline oversight; Big Oil rolls in taxpayer dough, as America's wind energy industry begs for scraps; PLUS:  Fox 'News' and hot air: No, wind farms do not cause global warming ....

Such efforts may be particularly beneficial for rural economic development, as many rural airport properties contain expansive grasslands that potentially could be converted to biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources.National Wildlife Research Center researchers are currently studying wildlife use of solar arrays and adjacent airport grasslands in Arizona, Colorado and Ohio, as well as wildlife use of experimental plots containing switchgrass and mixed warm-season native grasses in Mississippi, to help airports make informed decisions about how to use their land."}, {"title": "Wind Farms, Global Warming Connection Lukewarm At Best", "text": "A study released yesterday by researchers finds that large wind farms may impact local temperatures, noting a night warming effect in certain areas in Texas caused by \u201cthe turbulence in turbine wakes acting like fans to pull down warmer near surface air from higher altitudes at night.\u201d As Natural Resources Defense Council already pointed out, select media outlets covering this study have generated bad headlines which conflate \u201csmall-scale, local impacts on nighttime land surface temperatures and global climate disruption.\u201dRead more on Earth Techling"}, {"title": "Uggie 'The Artist' Dog PETA Ad: Campaign To Adopt A Pet (PHOTO)", "text": "Your adopted pet may not win an award at Cannes Film Festival or publish his own autobiography ... but it's not entirely impossible.

We never had a lawn; we let the hillside go brown in drought years. We had a bucket in the shower to catch the water that came out before it got warm. In starting Last Call at the Oasis, I was somewhat smug in feeling that I knew something about water issues.I realize now that all I really knew was drought. I didn't factor in climate change, groundwater depletion, contamination, outdated water laws, the battle between industry and the environment, etc., etc. All of which made this production a continually eye-opening experience for me. A sampling: we learned that there are estimates that that the aquifer in the Central Valley, which produces a quarter of our nation's food, might be depleted in as little as sixty years. One third of U.S. counties face water shortages by 2050. And of the more than 80,000 chemicals used in the United States, many of which end up in our water supplies, only 5 are regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act. What's going on is big, and it is crucial that we understand it. This is water -- essential for all life. Could the stakes be any higher?In the U.S., we tend to think of \"the water crisis\" as a problem for other countries, but as we show in Last Call, we are not immune. By the interconnected nature of the resource, the crisis is global, its impacts domino-like. We shouldn't feel insulated just because water flows freely from our taps.But we do feel insulated, don't we? For a while I contemplated calling the film A River in Egypt, but I realized that the problem isn't denial -- which implies willful dismissal of facts -- but ignorance. Water problems barely register on our list of concerns.This lack of awareness is the enemy for some of the most memorable characters in Last Call at the Oasis: the scientists and researchers who have been working in the trenches, studying the stresses on our water supply, from overuse to pollution. I found these scientists both fascinating and admirable, not just because of their findings, but because of their willingness to extend themselves beyond the traditional scientist's role. Their job description does not include holding press conferences and trying to sound the clarion call, but the scientists in the film realize it is not just enough to publish their work in a scientific journal. It's the \"tree falling in the forest\" syndrome: have you done your part, if you put out work that will never reach the public? No, says James Famiglietti, who studies groundwater depletion. As he told us, \"If you smelled smoke in a crowded theater, you would shout.\"Our film is about these personal stories -- of people smelling smoke and standing up to say something. People like activist Erin Brockovich, or farming-grandmother-turned-water-sentinel Lynn Henning. For over 20 years, Brockovich has been on the ground, helping communities facing water contamination and the David-and-Goliath-type dynamics of the struggle to hold polluters accountable. Henning has no scientific academic background, but when livestock factory farms polluted the waterways in her rural Michigan community, she learned how to be a water tester and began to monitor the contamination herself.If we have Erin and Lynn on one hand, we have millions of the happily oblivious on the other. In making the film, I became increasingly fixated on the psychological underpinnings of the water crisis. Problems like drought, pollution, contamination, competition for resources, and privatization are nothing new; they're as old as civilization. And yet we fail to handle them in any consistent, systematic way.We may assume that \"someone\" will come take care of our water problems. But in one five-year period, the EPA was only able to respond to 3 percent of the half-a-million reported violations of the Clean Water Act. This is not to say that the EPA is the bad guy: the agency is underfunded, under-supported, and its hands are often tied. If there is a bad guy, it's probably us.We don't want to pay more for water. We like our green lawns. We worry that environmental regulation will hurt economic development. We'd rather shell out for bottled water than an upgraded water treatment plant. We find the notion of recycling wastewater from drains and sewers disgusting rather than practical.But we adjust when we have to. When a news story pops up about a drought-stricken town having to truck in water, the idea of potable recycled water seems a bit less radical. Or when a giant sinkhole implodes an intersection, we're suddenly a little more interested in replacing the leaking pipes beneath our own city streets. The question is whether we will address our problems preemptively -- the cheaper, easier way -- or whether we will wait until an emergency forces our hand -- the painful way. There are myriad ways that we can help alleviate the stresses and lessen the threats to our water supply. But until we acknowledge that there is a problem, we can't progress.Which is not to say that Last Call is a lecture. It's a series of journeys... through the eyes of those who are on the ground, wrestling with circumstances that may face all of us. It's my hope that the total effect is more empowering than overwhelming, as the process of making this film was for me.At the Toronto Film Festival, Program Director Thom Powers deemed it \"a feel-angry movie.\" He later amended it to \"a feel smart movie.\" I like both labels, as they emphasize the \"feel\" part. We had hoped Last Call would be an emotional film, not just an educational one. We wanted to bring water problems into the open, to show the impact on the lives of real people -- to bring these oft-hidden abstractions into the light of day where we can finally see what's going on.Jessica Yu is the director of 'Last Call At the Oasis,' which opens in select theaters on May 4 in New York and Los Angeles before rolling out nationwide.

Now is the perfect time to take a look at how your garden fits into the natural ecosystem and whether or not it's helping out the local wildlife.Just because a garden is green, doesn't mean that it's \"green.\" Asking yourself some simple questions will help you decide what you can do to make your garden more in tune with nature. It's all about providing the basic elements of habitat: food, water, cover and places to raise young.Does your garden have native plants that provide berries, nectar and seeds as food sources for local wildlife? Do you have a water garden or birdbath to give the critters a place to drink and bathe? How about dense shrubbery, a meadow or even a brush pile to give animals a place to take cover from the elements or hide from predators? What about nesting boxes for birds or caterpillar host plants for butterflies to use as places to raise young?Beyond these four components of habitat, look at your gardening practices. Are you spraying toxic chemicals everywhere, planting exotic species that escape the garden and invade wild areas, or simply wasting water on fussy ornamentals?A quick assessment like this will give you some fast ideas on improvements that you can accomplish during Garden for Wildlife Month. And once you have those basic elements in place, you can submit your garden to become a Certified Wildlife Habitat with the National Wildlife Federation.When you get certified you'll be entered into NWF's National Habitat Registry, get a personalized certificate, a one-year membership to NWF, and the option to post a yard sign bragging to your neighbors of your accomplishment.

A new study from the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research suggests that a transformation of the world's economies or a limit to economic growth may be needed to curb the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.Published online in the journal Environmental Science & Policy, the study examined the impacts on global CO2 levels caused by the world economy (measured in global GDP), population, volcanic eruptions and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern oscillation. It is the \"first analysis to use measurable levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide\" rather than only estimates, \"which are less accurate,\" according to a press release.Jos\u00e9 Tapia Granados and Edward Ionides, both from Michigan, and \u00d3scar Carpintero of the University of Valladolid, Spain, discovered \"no observable relation\" between short-term global population growth and CO2 levels, but greater carbon dioxide levels were observed in years of \"above-trend world GDP\" between 1958 and 2010.The researchers found that for each trillion in U.S. dollars that global GDP deviates from the trend, there is an accompanying deviation in CO2 levels of about half a part per million (ppm), reported LiveScience.Noting that the study \"more or less\" echoes 1972's \"The Limits to Growth,\" author and environmental activist Bill McKibben told HuffPost in an email, \"We should change the meaning of 'business-as-usual' to focus on building more resilient, localized, community-focused economies, instead of the sprawling ones that for the last few decades have been awarding their bounty to the 1%.\"Study co-author Jos\u00e9 Tapia Granados offered a remedy, saying in a press release, \u201cOne solution that has promise is a carbon tax levied on any activity producing CO2 in order to create incentives to reduce emissions. The money would be returned to the population on a per capita basis so the tax would not mean any extra fiscal burden.\"The Michigan study comes at the same time as research from PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, a Dutch national environmental policy institute, which found that annual global equivalent CO2 emissions in 2020 are likely to exceed 2010 estimates by 2.5 billion tons.

The film highlights Brockovich's newest project, mapping disease clusters around the world in partnership with Google.Brockovich told HuffPost that this \"pet project\" began as she was receiving up to 50,000 emails per month from people reporting health issues in their communities, writing concerns such as: \"We think it's odd that we have 18 people on our street with Hodgkins; We think it's odd that we have 15 kids on our street with leukemia; We think it's odd that we have 20 people in the community with glioblastoma brain tumors.\"She began to plot the communities on a map, and Brockovich now believes, \"The map is going to be one of my life projects.\"Another focus of Brockovich's is military communities. The situation hits close to home -- her youngest daughter is a military police officer and her son recently returned from Afghanistan.Groundwater contamination at the Marine Corps' Camp Lejeune is of notable concern. Studies are currently examining links between past chemical exposure at the Lejeune and possible increased levels of diseases among former residents.Brockovich told HuffPost, \"You are looking at soldiers who would give their lives so we are afforded this opportunity to be here today. They come home from three, four tours of duty, and they get poisoned on their own soil. If we stand down on them, if we don't rally to look at this, it will be the biggest black eye on America I've ever known.\"Despite the many challenges facing the safety of the world's water supply, Brockovich also offered suggestions for improvements, such as examining increased regulations, private sector help with site cleanup, and improved company relations.She said, \"Corporations in communities need to be better neighbors. Communities have indicated they'd like support for an advisory board. See, communities want jobs. They don't want a company to go away. They work for those companies. That's how they feed their families, send their kids to college.

You upload them to Picasa or Facebook, or drag them into Dropbox. Question: Where do those photos actually reside? Answer: \"The Cloud.\" Right? Anytime, anywhere, you can reach into the cloud with whatever iGadget you have and pluck one of those photos. They're just floating around up there, waiting for you. Very convenient. And \"green.\" Isn't it?Down to EarthOf course the truth is, those photos -- along with millions of Youtube videos, emails, tax returns, interactive games, orthopedic x-rays, Tweets, unfinished novels and whatever else we keep creating, sending, receiving and not deleting, i.e., billions of files -- are all stored on massive servers in huge data centers that occupy actual real estate on the planet, in locations all around the world. And as our insatiable appetite for instant access to all of our info-stuff expands, the number of such data centers is expanding, exponentially. And these facilities all need power. Electricity. Lots of it.The Cloud Isn't GreenYes, the cloud needs to be plugged in. It also needs to be cooled because all those servers generate a lot of heat. Cooling that heat consumes enormous amounts of electricity, too.So where do these clouds get their electricity?Greenpeace, the environmental watchdog organization, recently published a provocative 50-page report -- \"How Clean is Your Cloud?\" -- that helps answer that question. It looks at the sources of power that 14 global Information Technology (IT) giants (almost all of them household names) employ to run their data centers throughout the world. It cites three of the largest expanding-cloud companies -- Amazon, Apple and Microsoft -- as relying \"heavily on dirty energy to power their clouds.\" It scores Apple as leading all others with 55 percent of its power usage coming from coal-generated electricity.The report credits Yahoo! and Google for their efforts in making access to renewable energy a priority as they expand their clouds. They receive a \"Clean Energy Index\" of 56 percent and 39 percent respectively. (The lowest CEI goes to Oracle at 7.1 percent.)Location, Location, LocationThe report also points out that when a company chooses a location for a cloud, it's also choosing the kind of electricity it will use -- for a long time to come. If a new cloud can only plug into a coal-generated electricity grid, it helps perpetuate a dirty power source that creates more pollution. Conversely, if an 800-million-user mega-cloud chooses a location-based on its access to a hydroelectric grid, as Facebook has in Lulea, Sweden, then that commitment supports and sustains renewable energy for a long time to come. Yahoo! used that reasoning to build in Lockport, New York, where it benefits not only from the hydroelectric grid, but also from the winds off Lake Ontario that cool its servers, further reducing electricity consumption. Some cloud companies are also signing long-term contracts to buy renewable electricity, thereby nourishing the market for clean power sources.While some of the companies mentioned in the report may take issue with Greenpeace's figures and analysis, there is no dispute that this giant sector of the technology universe is making choices that will continue to have enormous impact on the environment and the market for renewable energy well into the future. Kudos to Greenpeace for chiding and encouraging the IT companies to act responsibly.Meanwhile, we all might want to consider just how much of the billions of megabytes we generate everyday with our toys is really worth the electricity and environmental stress needed to save it on a server in, say, Council Bluffs, Iowa. In the material world, they have a name for people who can't decide what to keep and what to throw out: \"pack rats.\""}, {"title": "Will Oxford Students Speak Out to Protect the Integrity of Their University?", "text": "On April 25th, in a small French caf\u00e9 across the street from the Oxford University Vice-Chancellor\u2019s office, Jonathan Tomlin, a classics major and reporter for The Oxford Student, asked me what I hoped to achieve by the act I had just committed. Moments before I\u2019d delivered a petition to Oxford University Press of over 5,000 signers from 55 countries to Alasdair MacDonald, the Private Secretary to the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor was away.For months, six other scholars and I had pressed to speak with authorities of Oxford University Press about a shocking retreat by the Press -- the gold standard of academic publishing -- in upholding three basic academic standards. But not one of the two dozen Delegates (faculty ultimately responsible for the Press), would meet, even for tea, though we raise foundational questions about the integrity of Press\u2019s policies:One, the Press now publishes some books without citations for evidence-based claims on the most critical issues of our time. Examples include The Bottom Billion by Paul Collier and Nuclear Energy: What Everyone Needs to Know by Charles D. Ferguson. Without citations, how can readers evaluate the credibility of a work? Without citations, how can the Press uphold its commitment to a quality review by peers?Two, the Press has said in writing that conflict-of-interest disclosure applies only to financial associations. (The effect of this policy? Its book Food Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know doesn\u2019t disclose that the author Robert Paarlberg has been an official advisor to the CEO of the Monsanto Company, and in a letter to us the Press said that such nondisclosure is just fine.)Three, the Press promotes as an overview what is an argument by a proponent of one side of a contentious public issue: For example, it promotes Food Politics as a \u201cmap\u201d of \u201cconflicting claims and accusations from advocates on all sides,\u201d while the work presents one perspective by a widely recognized proponent.So my response to Jonathan, an earnest young man, about what we hope to achieve, was simple: to reverse these indefensible policies. To that end, we\u2019ll continue our petition and work to arrange a meeting with Vice-Chancellor Andrew D. Hamilton.\u201cBut it\u2019s you who have the power-- you students,\u201d I told Jonathan. \u201cMy biggest hope is that you students pursue these questions.\u201dAs we talked more, the obviousness of what I had just said hit me. So through the cold rain, shielding my head by with the plastic sheath that had held our 100-page petition, I hurried to the multi-story office of the Oxford University Student Union. I\u2019d hoped to talk with its president Martha Mackenzie, but no luck. So I left her our press release ... and crossed my fingers. The Student Union, I was told, gets involved in critical campus issues like these.And then there\u2019s the Oxford Union -- the famous debating society. So as soon as I got back to London, I emailed its president Isabel Ernst. Maybe questions raised by our campaign could be a perfect debate topic, I more than hinted.Now, if you know something of my work -- from 1971 Diet for a Small Planet to 2011 EcoMind -- and wonder why I\u2019ve taken this on, it\u2019s easy: Without evidence-based discourse democracy itself is not possible, and without democracy solutions to hunger and environmental collapse -- the focus of my life -- are out of reach. So it\u2019s been immensely gratifying to feel similar passion coming through the comments of so many petition signers. I sense that many see Oxford University Press as I do: a public treasure they do not want to lose, especially as we experience the wider media becoming less and less trustworthy.Ultimately, the question before Oxford University students right now is whether they will demand that their university\u2019s press hold to the same standards that are required of them.Let\u2019s hope so.P.S. So please join in. Sign our petition and leave your comments. For more background, please visit www.scholarlystandardsatrisk.org.

It's late April and this is what's in season near me. How do I know this?As is increasingly the case, there is an app for that. No, it's not Siri. It's called NRDC Eat Local and after downloading it for free, in just a few clicks I got my answer.Once it's on your iPhone (sorry, Android), open it and choose the \"In Season\" tab at the bottom, select your state and the season (which mine did automatically after I answered the question about location) and choose what food category you are interested in.I selected late April, New York, and \"All\" food categories, so up they all popped, including Eastern Oysters, which the app tells me are the most popular or \"widely consumed\" oysters in America.It may not be the bounty one finds at farmers markets later in the summer or fall, but it got me excited about dinner. The app provides helpful info about each produce item, including some nutritional details as well as tips on storage, prep and cooking. And most produce come with links to some pretty terrific-sounding recipes, all of which are housed on the Smarter Living section of NRDC.org. The one I found on the bottom of the Asparagus page -- that calls for mixing together chopped asparagus, mango and shitake mushrooms and rolling the mixture all up in rice paper -- has my mouth watering.To find where I could buy regionally grown asparagus, I clicked on the Farmers Market icon in the lower left corner of the app and plugged in my work ZIP code so I could run out at lunch time and get what I needed for dinner. Full disclosure, Paul McRandle and I worked together with a developer, Scott Santulli, to create this App for NRDC. It's been our own experience that choosing produce that is grown locally, and picked at the peak of freshness, matters a lot in terms of better taste and nutritional value. In fact, according to Mark Izeman, the director of NRDC's Urban Program, New York, \"Studies have shown that produce loses nutrients each day after it has been harvested and after three days it has lost 40 percent of its nutritional value.\"Shopping at farmer's markets, Izeman adds, supports small and mid-sized farms in the region, which when compared to the large industrial farm from which most big chain supermarkets get their produce, are generally using more sustainable, \"less intensive\" farming practices. New York State has \"the fourth-highest number of organic farms in the nation, more than 825,\" Izeman says, adding that farmers using organic and sustainable methods strive to retain top soil (a bigger global problem that you might expect); preserve biodiversity; and reduce contaminated runoff into waterways.I've got yet another reason for buying my produce at the farmers market. Meals prepared at home using fresh seasonal and local ingredients are not just better for your health, but better for your wallet. You'll always pay more for take-out, and that goes for lunch as well as dinner.The app lists more than 5,200 farmers markets and features 64 produce items, including seafood, heirloom turkeys and more. There are more than 100 links to recipes. So if you love fresh food and are curious about what's freshest when and where, check out this new app -- NRDC Eat Local -- and tell us what you think. And more importantly, help us make it better. Use the \"Submit Market\" button on the app to help us fill in gaps in our content.Now grab a a couple bags and head out to the nearest farmers market and pick up something fresh for lunch -- and dinner."}, {"title": "Should I Buy An Electric Car?", "text": "Does an electric car make sense for you?

Bush sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson urging her to use Clean Air Act to prevent chemical disasters.Yes, you heard that right, in a world where Newt Gingrich is calling for the abolition of the EPA, there is common sense bi-partisan support for the EPA using its authority to make us safer. Governor Whitman can speak with authority about this issue because she, as EPA chief under President George W. Bush, drafted such a program in 2002, driven by the country's national security concerns following the 9/11 attacks.The EPA's 2002 proposal, complete with a roll out plan, hinged on using the \"Bhopal Amendment\" of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. Commonly called the \"General Duty Clause\" (GDC) this section of the Clean Air Act obligates chemical facilities who handle hazardous chemicals to prevent chemical disasters.Greenpeace joined over 100 organizations last year in a letter to President Obama calling on him to fully implement the Bhopal Amendment and prioritize disaster prevention through the use of safer technology.One in three people in the United States live within the potential disaster zone of one of the 480+ highest risk chemical facilities. Each of these facilities puts 100,000 people or more at risk. Most major U.S. cities are threatened, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Detroit, Philadelphia and many more. In fact, Washington, D.C. is one of the only cities no longer at risk, as its dangerous facility quickly converted to a safer technology just a few weeks after 9/11. Every community should be free from the threat of a chemical disaster, not just our capital.Just weeks before Governor Whitman made her plea to Administrator Jackson, the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) made the same recommendation in a letter to Jackson. The NEJAC is a federal advisory committee to the EPA that recommends actions for the EPA to take to protect the interests of the most vulnerable communities in the U.S., and is made up of representatives from the EPA, environmental justice communities, and industry.In President Obama's State of the Union address this year he made it clear that if \"election-year politics\" is going to keep Congress from making progress, that his administration would take action. Congress has had over ten years to secure the nation's chemical facilities and it has failed to close this massive security gap and threat to communities. By fully implementing the Clean Air Act's general duty clause President Obama can make real progress in creating a safer nation without having to deal with the obstructionist Congress. President Obama has been incredibly consistent in his desire to see dangerous chemical plants switch to safer technology, from cosponsoring bills in the Senate to his campaign platform where he set as a goal: \"Secure our chemical plants by setting a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must follow, including... where possible, using safer technology, such as less toxic chemicals.\"President Obama has sent clear signals that he will pursue initiatives that he can move forward within existing laws and without the need to wrestle with Congress. Now is the time for the president to take action to protect communities from the threat of chemical disasters.Click here to sign our petition to President Obama."}, {"title": "Robert Barnhart, Lamar Advertising Ex-Employee, Says Former Company Illegally Poisoned Trees", "text": "By Mother Nature Network's John Platt:A former employee of one of the country's largest outdoor advertising companies has blown the whistle on his ex-bosses, saying the company routinely and illegally poisoned and chopped down trees that obscured views of their billboards.Robert J. Barnhart, a former crew chief for Lamar Advertising Co. in Tallahassee, Fla., says he used to sneak onto private property early in the morning armed with a machete and a bottle of herbicide. He would chop at the roots or trunks of trees, pour on the herbicide \u2014 and run. MSNBC reports that Barnhart's boss called such an operation \"a hit and run.\"Barnhart, who is not speaking directly to the press, says he was fired in August 2011 after refusing to continue the tree poisonings. He is suing Lamar Advertising under the Florida Private Whistleblower's Act. Barnhart's charges against Lamar are under investigation. No charges have been filed.A second Lamar employee has also come forward admitting to poisoning trees on the company's behalf.Lamar has previously been cited for violations in Ohio and Connecticut. The company says both incidents were mistakes.A Lamar spokesperson released a statement, saying \"cutting of trees or poisoning of trees without the required permits would be contrary to company policy.\"Another Florida company, Bill Salter Outdoor Advertising, has been cited for illegal tree killings. The company reportedly cleared more than 2,000 trees from public land. Salter had a permit for the cutting spree, but a grand jury found that the permits were \"in flagrant violation of the law\" because the company was not required to reimburse the state for the value of the trees, which was estimated at between $1 and $4 million.In discussing the cases, a spokesperson for the Outdoor Advertisers Association of America told Forbes, \"Our code is clear. We oppose illegal vegetation removal.\"Other cases are creating headlines around the country. Heineken \u2014 still reeling from the incorrect charges that it sponsored illegal dog fights \u2014 faces criticism that two trees in New York City's SoHo district were topped to improve the view of a Heineken billboard. Heineken says the action was taken by a third party. A spokesperson told the media \"we find it to be reprehensible\" and said the company will replace the trees at the company's expense.  And in North Carolina, state engineers have approved hundreds of requests to remove trees that Adams Outdoor Advertising says are blocking the view of its billboards. A new law in the state gives billboard companies the right to clear vegetation for hundreds of feet around their advertisements. Charlotte's city arborist, Don McSween, told WSOC that the city had argued against the trees' removal, saying, \"we're obviously disappointed.\""}, {"title": "The Audaciousness of Hope: Reasons for Optimism at the Ceres Conference 2012", "text": "Let me 'fess up. The state of the environment sometimes gets me down. But to be fair, Earth's vital signs would drive any respectable emergency room doctor into a state of utter panic. Globally, two thirds of ecosystem services, such as freshwater, pollination, natural hazard regulation, have been degraded in the past 50 years. Annual rates of growth in yields of many basic crops have declined over the past 20 years. The effects of global climate change are already being felt around the world.But attending the Ceres annual conference this week gave me a refreshing dose of optimism. Ceres, a coalition of investors, environmental organizations, and other public interest groups, drew together hundreds of businesses, investors, and non-profits to share innovative approaches for corporate sustainability. Here are three rays of hope from the conference.The flagship report of the conference was The Road to 2020: Corporate Progress on the Ceres Roadmap for Sustainability. This report evaluates how 600 large publicly traded companies are progressing along the Ceres sustainability roadmap. If you've seen the report's headlines, \"businesses failing,\" \"businesses falling short,\" and \"disappointing results,\" you might be wondering where my ray of hope is in all this.Well, here is the deal. By tracking and publicly reporting companies' progress along the roadmap, Ceres has created a powerful tool to drive corporate progress in the race to sustainability. Imagine if their more than 100 investors use it to inform how they invest $10 trillion dollars, or if the 130 civil society organizations in the Ceres coalition use it to focus their advocacy and campaign efforts? The roadmap also provides much needed guideposts to companies currently wandering in the dark as they seek a more sustainable path forward.During the conference, participants discussed a number of practical tools to facilitate corporate sustainability efforts. Ceres and WRI teamed up to showcase how our respective tools, Aqua Gauge and Aqueduct, can provide an integrated approach to assessing and managing water risk. The WRI Aqueduct tool maps indicators of geographic water risks, complementing the Ceres Aqua Gauge framework for assessing companies' response to water risk. Together they enable investors to compare water risks across geographic regions and companies.Another promising tool, especially for those skeptics who believe people are only motivated by money, is linking executive pay to sustainability performance. While this is still a rarity, several companies are blazing a trail on this dimension of good governance, including: Intel, Excel Energy and Campbell Soup.Of course tools are just means to ends. But they can both speed up the achievement of the ends and generate more effective results. The greenhouse gas accounting standards and tools developed by GHG Protocol over the past decade is a case in point. We have progressed from companies unaware of their emissions to companies reporting on their emissions, on to companies setting reduction targets and more recently companies expanding their reduction ambitions to their value chains and products. Which brings me to my next ray of hope...Ten years ago, it was rare for companies to focus their sustainability efforts beyond their own direct operations. Today, it is increasingly accepted that corporate responsibility does not stop at the factory gate. One way WRI is helping companies look beyond their direct impacts is the release of two new GHG Protocol standards to measure value chain (scope 3) and product-level greenhouse gas emissions.For many companies, it turns out that the majority of sustainability risks and opportunities reside in their value chains. Levi Strauss & Co., for example, released a white paper at the conference on its efforts to improve the health and well-being of workers in factories in its supply chain. And Levi's is just one example; a session on building sustainable supply chains overflowed with corporate representatives sharing their experiences at the Ceres conference.Ultimately we need all companies, not just the leaders, to make sustainability part of their corporate fabric. That will require changing the rules of the game. This is where governments must play a key role, ensuring that policies and incentives are aligned with driving more sustainable business action. Leadership companies should add their voices to those advocating for more progressive environmental and social policies. Such policies will also benefit them because they are better positioned to compete under new rules than the laggards.Now if that happens, we really will have something to be hopeful about."}, {"title": "Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake Energy Chairman, To Be Replaced", "text": "(Corrects date in 6th paragraph to June 2014 instead of June 2012)* Co to end Founders Well program 18 months early* Board member says move will improve corp governance* Shares jump 10 pctMay 1 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp will find an independent, non-executive chairman to replace current Chairman Aubrey McClendon, who will retain his position as chief executive of the natural gas producer, the company said on Tuesday.McClendon, who is Chesapeake's founder, also agreed to an early end to a controversial program that grants him minority stakes in Chesapeake's wells, a perk that had sparked investor anger and inquiries from federal regulatory and tax agencies.Shares in Chesapeake were up 7.6 percent to $19.85 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rallying as much as 11 percent in the opening minutes.The move came less than two weeks after Reuters reported that McClendon had taken out as much as $1.1 billion in personal loans using his well stakes as collateral, an arrangement that analysts said posed potentially serious conflicts of interest.Most of the money was lent by an investment management company, EIG Global Energy Partners, that is also a major investor in Chesapeake itself.McClendon will receive no compensation of any kind in connection with the termination at the end of June 2014 of that program, known as the Founders Well Participation Program, the company said. It had been scheduled to run through 2015.\"We believe separation of the chairman and CEO roles will improve Chesapeake's corporate governance and the early termination of the FWPP will eliminate a source of controversy, both of which should send a positive signal to the market and improve shareholder value,\" Merrill \"Pete\" Miller, Jr., Chesapeake's lead independent director, said in a statement.Board members contacted by Reuters referred queries to Chesapeake.The news came a day after Chesapeake, the nation's second largest natural gas producer, said the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was reviewing issues related to McClendon's well ownership.The program had also come under the scrutiny of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the company's board of directors had said last week it planned to negotiate an early termination of the plan.The move to replace McClendon as chairman was backed by the company's largest stakeholder, Chesapeake said.\"We are pleased that the Board has listened to our input and believe it has made the right decision by ending the FWPP early and seeking an independent chairman,\" O. Mason Hawkins, head of Southeastern Asset Management, the company's largest shareholder, said in the statement released by the company.The comment was the first on the controversy from Hawkins, a reclusive investor based in Memphis, Tennessee, whose firm owns 13 percent of the company.\"Finally, he's coming to the forefront. This points to a very significant shareholder pounding the table,\" said Mark Hanson, oil and gas industry analyst at Morningstar Inc.Another investor who has been critical of the board said it could have ended the FWPP immediately.\"They're (the board) bending to the winds of the IRS and the SEC, but they're certainly not taking the lead internally in making significant changes,\" said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management LLP, which owns about 1 million Chesapeake shares.

The book is available now from Avery. This selection examines the Puente Hills landfill, a mountain of garbage in Southern California and the largest active municipal dump in the country.* * * * *1. AIN\u2019T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGHMike Speiser\u2019s sculpting technique is a study in geometric perfection and economy of motion. Every cut, every shave, every subtle drag of his blade has a purpose, each forming a small piece of a much larger work, sprawling and unique.His peers call him Big Mike, for he is a mountain of a man, shaved head set like an amiable boulder atop broad shoulders and a mighty belly, six-two and more than three hundred pounds. He seems designed by central casting exactly for the purpose of wielding his main artistic tool\u2014the towering, thundering 60-ton BOMAG Compactor. With its roaring, clanking assistance, Big Mike has helped build something unprecedented: the Puente Hills landfill, largest active municipal dump in the country.Puente Hills is so sprawling that it has evolved its own ecosystem and nature preserve, spawned multiple community organizations formed to kill it, and holds enough strata of methane-spewing decomposing garbage to power a hundred thousand homes (which is exactly what is done with the eye-watering \u201clandfill gas\u201d bubbling up from beneath). Puente Hills has been the final resting place for the lion\u2019s share of Los Angeles County\u2019s ample daily flow of garbage for more than three decades\u2014130 million tons of it and counting.One hundred thirty million tons: Such a number is hard to grasp. Here\u2019s one way to picture it: If Puente Hills were an elephant burial ground, its tonnage would represent about 15 million deceased pachyderms\u2014equivalent to every living elephant on earth, times twenty. If it were an automobile burial ground, it could hold every car produced in America for the past fifteen years.It is, quite literally, a mountain of garbage.Big Mike\u2019s German-made BOMAG is the primary tool for taming this garbage nexus.The BOMAG (derived from the German-language mouthful of a company name, Bopparder Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft) is a fourteen-foot-tall, thirty-foot-long, swivel-hipped bulldozer that can turn on a dime yet push its terrain-clearing blade with 100,000 pounds of force. Its six-foot wheels are spiked with dinosaur- sized steel teeth that can crush, mold and squeeze up to 13,000 tons of garbage into a fifteen-foot-deep rectangle the length and width of a football field.Big Mike sculpts such a mound not in a month or a week, but in one glorious day, every day, as he and his colleagues dump, push, carve and build a pinnacle of trash where once there were canyons. He is king of a mountain built of old tricycles and bent board games, yellowed newspapers and bulging plastic bags, sewage sludge and construction debris\u2014all the detritus, discards and once valuable tokens of modern life and wealth, reduced to an amorphous, dense amalgam known as \u201cfill.\u201dThe football-field-sized plot at the center of activity atop Puente Hills is called a \u201ccell,\u201d not in the prison-block sense, but more akin to the tiny biological unit, many thousands of which are needed to create a single, whole organism. As with living creatures, this cell, titanic as it is, represents a small building block for the modern landfill\u2014the part that grows and reproduces each day. A dozen BOMAGs, bulldozers and graders swarm over this fresh fill every day, backing and turning and mashing and shaping, their warning gongs clanging and engines roaring in a controlled chaos, mammoth bees crawling atop the hive. Their curved steel blades raise up and blot the sun, then drop into the sea of trash and push it forward, waves of debris flowing off either side as if the dozers\u2019 blades were the prows of a schooner fleet, complete with the flap and quarrel of seagulls overhead, their cranky squawks drowned out by the diesel din. A sickly-sweet smell of decay kicks up when the cell is churned this way, and the thrum and grind of the big engines can be felt in the ground near the cell. The noise induces sympathetic vibrations in the chest of anyone nearby, creating the uncomfortable sensation of being near a marching band with too many bass drummers.Building a garbage mountain is difficult, edgy, dangerous work. Within the new cell, the trash flow can pile up twenty to thirty feet or more during the day before it\u2019s crushed and compacted and covered with clean dirt (that\u2019s what makes it a sanitary landfill\u2014the ick gets buried every day). The drivers negotiating and moving that cell-in-the-making must constantly be wary of the drop-off from their garbage pile\u2014and the uncontrolled, possibly tumbling sled ride that tipping over the edge could bring about. Eight landfill workers nationwide died on the job in 2010.To build a proper trash mountain, one that is a feat of engineering rather than a random aggregation of garbage, each cell must be level at the top so it can be covered and sealed with up to a foot of soil, the last task of any day at the landfill. The machine operators rely on laser-guided markers to keep their mound level, except for Big Mike, who seems to be able to do it by dead reckoning alone. His coworkers say he can visualize the final form of a field of compacted trash the way an artist can see the carving within the block of wood or the figure hiding inside the marble. A member of Puente Hills\u2019s team of waste engineers, guys with hard hats and clipboards who plot out each day of garbage burial with the same care and planning once lavished on an Egyptian mummy\u2019s tomb, glances one morning at a section of new fill and says, \u201cOh, look at that perfect edge\u2014that\u2019s Big Mike\u2019s work. That\u2019s his style.\u201d The other engineers nod.Later, Mike grins sheepishly when he hears about the compliment. He\u2019s forty-eight and has been doing this for twenty years. The little fang earrings he sports jiggle a little with his chuckle. \u201cI do love my work,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere else can you accomplish something every day, see the progress right in front of you, and know you\u2019re doing something useful and good? And on top of that, it\u2019s fun. Where else are you going to drive a hundred and twenty thousand pounds of machine around all day and get paid for doing it?\u201dHis life\u2019s work is the mother of all landfills, its innovations and pioneering techniques copied and studied. But in truth, calling it a landfill these days is a bit misleading, as it stopped physically \u201cfilling\u201d a depression in the land (the original definition of landfill) long ago. For quite some time, the garbage mountain of Puente Hills has been rising above its surrounding terrain, resembling nothing more than a huge and eerily modern version of an ancient tell\u2014those giant mounds in the Middle Eastern deserts that mark where once-mighty cities rose and fell, and that now lie buried and broken beneath the sands.Archaeologists love tells\u2014and, particularly, the middens they usually conceal, those ancient trash dumps that, five thousand years later, provide a treasure trove of information about life and events in the distant past. Archaeologists long ago figured out that the real nature of human life isn\u2019t that we are what we eat. They know we are best understood by what we throw away. Thousands of years from now, the Puente Hills landfill, buffered, insulated, wrapped in layers of clay and polyethylene, and more secure against earthquakes, winds and floods than any other structure in California, may serve a similar archaeological purpose, a tell for future researchers hoping to puzzle out our lifestyle, choices and beliefs. Certainly it will still be here after everything else is gone, an enduring monument holding the 102-ton legacies of millions of Angelenos. Landfills, Big Mike likes to say, are forever.For now, Puente Hills is a living, breathing landfill\u2014with a deadly \u201cbreath\u201d expelled in massive burps that must constantly be siphoned off or risk disaster, a reeking, highly explosive, climate-destroying exhalation capable of turning green grass brown in short order. This property of buried garbage proved a difficult lesson in the bad old days of trash disposal early in the twentieth century, when cities routinely used trash and ash to fill in swamps and mudflats. (Such areas were regarded as bothersome wastelands impeding progress back then; we call them irreplaceable, vital wetlands and endangered habitats now that we\u2019ve destroyed most of them.) Housing projects, stadiums, parks and other developments that were planted atop early fills suffered from unexplained stenches, vermin infestations, swarms of roaches and, once decomposition had reached critical mass, methane fires and explosions. Long Island, San Francisco and a hundred other places in between all learned this the hard way: Trash can be deadly when you bury it. Puente Hills\u2019s deep, aging refuse pile produces a constant flow of 31,000 cubic feet a minute of landfill gas (roughly half methane, half carbon dioxide, with traces of various pollutants mixed in). If allowed to bottle up within the landfill, it could turn Garbage Mountain into something resembling a fiery trash volcano. This is the flow that generates 50 megawatts of electricity around the clock and provides power for all landfill operations to boot. You\u2019d have to cover 250 acres (or two and a half Disneylands) of sun-drenched Mojave Desert with parabolic mirrors to generate an equivalent output of solar power. At Puente Hills, the gas is expected to continue to flow for at least another twenty years after the landfill accepts its last piece of garbage.Which is another way of saying that Puente Hills is big. Really big. It covers 1,365 acres, half of that space devoted to buffer zone and (oddly enough) wildlife preserve. The other half\u2014a plot about the size of New York City\u2019s Central Park\u2014is devoted strictly to trash, which by 2011 had reached heights greater than five hundred feet above the original ground level. If the trash mounds of Puente Hills were a high-rise, they would be among the twenty tallest skyscrapers in Los Angeles, beating out the MGM Tower, Fox Plaza and Los Angeles City Hall. Puente Hills is big enough to have its own micro-climate and wind patterns, which the crews are constantly battling with berms and deodorizers and giant fans, trying to keep noxious odors from wafting through the surrounding bedroom communities of Whittier and Hacienda Heights.Landfills are usually thought of, when they are thought of at all, as out-of-the-way things. Nobody really wants to think about what they contain: Puente Hills harbors millions of tons of moldering old carpet, even more rotting food and a good 3 million tons of dirty disposable diapers\u20142.5 percent of the total landfill weight consists of soiled Pampers, Huggies and all the other sweet names for some very noxious refuse. The material that seeps out of it, a noxious brew called \u201cleachate,\u201d is so toxic that it has to be contained by multiple clay, plastic and concrete barriers, drainage systems and a network of testing wells just to keep it dammed and prevent it from poisoning groundwater supplies. The landfill workers didn\u2019t start trying to restrain this toxic goop by putting down strata of waterproof plastic liners under incoming trash until 1988\u2014almost no American landfill did. So there are millions of tons of garbage at the bottom, oozing downward, a closely monitored potential time bomb. Every landfill started before 1991, when tougher federal regulations finally kicked in to make liners a requirement, is the same.Yet this Garbage Mountain is not set in the hinterlands, neither out of sight nor out of mind. It lies smack in the middle of the most populous urban sprawl in America, the Los Angeles Basin, rising up to dominate its low-slung skyline for miles, a misshapen mound planted with thirty different species of trees and shrubs in a bold and ultimately futile attempt to mask its true nature.Reprinted from Garbology by Ed Humes by arrangement with Avery, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., Copyright \u00a9 2012 by Ed Humes."}, {"title": "Mei Xiang, National Zoo's Female Panda, Receives Artificial Insemination", "text": "By Clara Moskowitz, LiveScience Senior Writer:Spring is in the air, and baby panda-making is in the minds of zookeepers at the Smithsonian's National Zoo \u2014 if not those of their panda charges.Zookeepers have decided to artificially inseminate female giant panda Mei Xiang, at the Washington, D.C., zoo today (April 30), and live tweet the proceedings. It's the second try, after a first insemination Sunday.\"One of our repro experts, Dr. Aiken-Palmer holds the next vial of 100,000 million sperm. 'It only takes one!'\" tweeted Dave Wildt, National Zoo reproductive scientist and head of the Center for Species Survival.The scientists are trying this technological intervention after a natural attempt fell flat. [Video: Panda Mating Dance]\"Veterinarians performed an artificial insemination Sunday night after they determined no competent natural breeding had occurred between Mei Xiang and male giant panda, Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN),\" zoo officials wrote in a statement.The two pandas have successfully bred before \u2014 Mei Xiang gave birth to cub Tai Shan in 2005 \u2014 but they aren't so good at getting it on themselves (Tai Shan was conceived via artificial insemination).Furthermore, female pandas are fertile only one to two days a year, so zookeepers had to seize the rare opportunity.Giant pandas, native to southeastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam, are now endangered; only 1,600 pandas are left in the wild. Captive breeding is a chief part of scientists' efforts to study and conserve the species.Plus, baby pandas are heart-meltingly cute, and present a big draw for any zoo. The National Zoo had to send Tai Shan back to China in 2010, because all pandas, regardless of where they are born, officially belong to China under international law. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are on loan to the United States until 2015.\"Mei Xiang is 13 and the mother of Tai Shan, who was born in 2005 and beloved in DC. Baby pandas= #pandamania! #pandaAI,\" Wildt tweeted under the National Zoo's Twitter account, @NationalZoo.For today's artificial insemination, zookeepers are using sperm from Tian Tian harvested back when Tai Shan was born.\"While under general anesthesia, Mei Xiang was inseminated with thawed semen collected from Tian Tian in 2005,\" zoo officials wrote. \"Scientists determined that the fresh semen collected from Tian Tian last night was not high enough quality to use for the artificial insemination. Zoo staff will continue to monitor Mei Xiang's hormone levels in the coming months and conduct ultrasounds to see if she is pregnant.\" (But even figuring out if a female panda is pregnant can be tricky; it is often difficult to identify a panda fetus through an ultrasound. And female giant pandas, inlcuding Mei Xiang, regularly undergo pseudo-pregnancies, which mimic the real thing to a tee, sans the developing infant.)The zoo has invited those who want to follow the panda action live to tweet their questions using the hastag #pandaAI.You can follow LiveScience senior writer Clara Moskowitz on Twitter @ClaraMoskowitz.

Incredibly resilient, frogs, toads and other amphibians have a remarkable ability to overcome virtually every challenge thrown their way.Until now.Under a mounting barrage of environmental pressures, one in four amphibian species in the United States is now imperiled and worldwide, 122 species have gone extinct since 1980. Equally troubling, a just-published study finds that 82 percent of amphibians that need help aren't protected under the Endangered Species Act and efforts to save those that are protected are woefully underfunded.While the Act has had unparalleled success saving some of America's most iconic species, from grizzly bears and gray wolves to bald eagles and peregrine falcons, the news for amphibians only gets worse with each passing year.The story is much the same for reptiles.In the U.S., scores of amphibian and reptile species are at risk. Yet, reptiles and amphibians make up just 58 of the 1,400 species protected under the Act.After decades of unrelenting habitat destruction, pollution, introduced diseases, and a host of other threats, the situation for herpetofauna or \"herps,\" as amphibians and reptiles are known to biologists, is dire.That's why scientists at the Center for Biological Diversity are taking a close look at the most stressed herps across the U.S. to see which are most in-need of new protections.There's clearly much to be done.For example, the Cascades frog has been lost from half its range in California and is declining elsewhere in the face of habitat destruction and introduced trout, and in Arkansas, scientists warn that extinction of the Illinois chorus frog may be imminent.In the Pacific Northwest, logging is threatening the clouded salamander causing steep declines. In the Southeast, the prehistoric-looking alligator snapping turtles that patrolled southeastern waterways for tens of thousands of years have declined by 95 percent, thanks in part to overharvest for Asian food, pet and medicinal markets.Our amphibians and reptiles are at a critical stage. Fortunately, here in the U.S., we have the Endangered Species Act, which has averted extinction for 99.9 percent of the plants and animals that it protects. The Act works and it's time that herps finally get the help they deserve.Like all wildlife, amphibians and reptiles are worth saving for their own sake, and for the sake of preserving the rich biological diversity and balance necessary for a healthy planet.And the dramatic decline of our herpetofauna populations offers a broader warning.Because amphibians breathe through their skin, lay their eggs in water and live on land, over the course of their lives they're subjected to every major environmental threat, making them the true \"canary\" in our biosphere.The quality of their health offers us a remarkably accurate snapshot of the health of the planet, and of our own."}, {"title": "Guess What Drugs and Illegal Substances Are Showing Up in Chicken?", "text": "In 2005, the antibiotic fluoroquinolone was banned by the FDA for use in poultry production. The reason for the ban was an alarming increase in antibiotic-resistant campylobacter bacteria in the meat of chickens and turkeys -- \"superbugs,\" which can lead to a lethal form of meningitis that our current antibiotics are no longer effective against.Antibiotic-resistant infections kill tens of thousands of people every year, more than die of AIDS, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. This problem is on the rise because antibiotics are recklessly overused, especially in the commercial livestock industry, where 80% of all antibiotics manufactured in the U.S. end up.Fluoroquinolone used to be fed to chickens primarily to stimulate their growth. But why did the banned substance show up recently in eight of 12 samples of \"feather meal,\" the ground-down plumage leftover from commercial poultry production?This was just one of the mysteries uncovered in a study conducted jointly by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and Arizona State University. The research, published last month in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, uncovered a whole slew of other drugs in the feather meal that the scientists had not expected to find there.Traces of the arsenic compound Roxarsone, for example, were present in almost all of the samples. Farms administer arsenic to chickens to turn their flesh just the right shade of pink that consumers find attractive. Yet, in June 2011, the FDA gave Pfizer 30 days to discontinue selling Roxarsone, a proven carcinogen. So why is it still showing up in our chickens?Other substances that the scientists found include acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, Benadryl, an antihistamine, even Prozac, an antidepressant. Farms feed chickens these mood-altering drugs to reduce their anxiety. Chickens are anxious because they are bred on overcrowded and filthy factory farms. Stressed-out birds develop meat that is tough and unpalatable, so they need to be sedated. Yet, chickens on tranquilizers sleep all the time and do not eat enough. So they are given high doses of caffeine (which was also found in the feather meal) to keep them awake at night to feed and fatten up.So, here is the deal. We create hellish conditions for our livestock, then we drug them to keep them numb. Then we drug them again to wake them from their pharmaceutical stupor. Then we drug them to grow faster. Then we drug them so their flesh will look healthier. Then we drug them to withstand the disease epidemics that our overcrowding has created.Then, of course, we drug ourselves every time we take a bite of factory-farmed poultry.\"We were kind of floored,\" Keeve E Nachman, a co-author of the study told the New York Times. \"It's unbelievable what we found.\" While Nachman says that the levels of arsenic and the witches' brew of other drugs and chemicals in the chicken samples may not be high enough to harm humans, he is not betting his own health on it.\"I've been studying food-animal production for some time,\" the researcher said, \"and the more I study, the more I'm drawn to organic. We buy organic [in my family].\"Organic chickens are bred without artificial growth hormones and antibiotics. They are fed organically grown vegetable foods rather than the ground-up animal products -- bones, feathers, blood, excrement, fishmeal and diseased animal parts -- which their conventionally grown brethren receive. They are also raised free-range with plenty of space, sunlight and opportunities for exercise to keep them healthy. A 2001 study conducted at the University of Perugia found that chickens produced this way actually taste better than conventionally bred birds.Yet, organic poultry is a lot more expensive to raise. While the market is growing steadily for organic birds, it still comprises less than 1% of the poultry sold in the US today. So, food scientists argue that the standards for conventional chickens and turkeys need to be strengthened.\"We strongly believe that the FDA should monitor what drugs are going into animal feed,\" Keeve Nachman urged, adding that, based on what the researchers discovered, they had little confidence that the animal food production industry could be left to regulate itself.Earlier this month, the FDA announced what looked at first glance like sweeping new guidelines on the use of antibiotics in livestock. The new rules, however, are strictly \"voluntary,\" and, while they do recommend restricting the use of antibiotics to stimulate growth, they would still allow them to be prescribed by a veterinarian for animals that are \"either sick or at risk of getting a specific illness.\"Critics contend that the words \"at risk of getting a specific illness\" provide factory poultry farms a loophole big enough to drive a truck through. Margaret Mellon, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a press statement:\"The outlined process appears to give the companies the opportunity to relabel drugs currently slated for growth promotion for disease prevention instead. Such relabeling could allow them to sell the exact same drugs in the very same amounts.\"Public interest groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists say the time has come for the FDA to stop proposing half-measures and demonstrate that it is serious about preventing a looming public health disaster. It needs to ban dangerous antibiotic use in the raising of livestock, and to conduct rigorous on-site inspections to insure that the ban is enforced.An earlier version of this article appeared in the Guardian UK."}, {"title": "View From Inside Chesapeake's Board of Directors", "text": "Chesapeake Energy -- a major driver behind the so-called \"shale gale\" of shale gas production -- has been all over the news lately, with intense scrutiny of CEO Aubrey McClendon's attempt to take out more than $1 billion in loans for a complex deal to give himself a share of proceeds from the wells they're drilling. The company's board of directors blocked McClendon's new move, but he's already in hock for $846 million, the New York Times reports.(For more on Chesapeake, check out Jeff Goodell's excellent feature in Rolling Stone, \"The Big Fracking Bubble,\" that delves into the company's land deals, and Christopher Helman's earlier profile of McClendon in Forbes that tries to make sense of the company's beguilingly complex financial arrangements.)In light of all this, I thought people would be interested in this view from within Chesapeake's board, from a book that is probably little-read, called Peak Oil Personalities, in a chapter by Charles T. Maxwell, an oil industry analyst and investor who has been on Chesapeake's board since 2002 -- before the shale boom really took off.In 2002, I was invited to join the board of Chesapeake Energy Corporation... I came to the job full of traditional conventions about analytically correct balance sheet ratios, and so on. But in the first several years I was confronted by a riveting problem.The problem, as Maxwell explains, was that fracking had opened up new areas to production, and it was all sufficiently new that it was hard to know what to expect -- so his \"traditional conventions\" didn't fly. But also, McClendon didn't want to stick with traditional ways of financing the operation, as Maxwell explains.Now a page was being turned, and a new chapter was beginning. How large could this play become? How long would typical shale production keep going at economic rates of output? What would be the additional stimulation costs of this technology? Would the costs attendant on a shale-based drilling programme doom shale gas production to the bottom rung of returns on capital? Could the company afford the land position and drilling obligations required to dominate this play in acreage close to the sweet spots?All these questions, it seems, were difficult to grapple with, because there was so little experience with fracking shale to unlock shale gas.McClendon brought in the evidence from the field, and we debated it with him on many separate levels and with different top personnel. In the end, he wanted to seize the once-in-a-generation opportunity to pioneer a vast new play in land and reserves. That would involve tolerance of increased leverage on the balance sheet. What was the trade-off here? Such an assemblage of superior oil shale lands, the board well understood, would not likely be presented again. But, it would be an expensive endeavor. There was only a narrow window of time to make many concerted decisions.As others began to agree, they wanted a piece of the action as well. This allowed Chesapeake to continue acquiring more leases, to drill not only in the \"superior\" shale lands, but also elsewhere.... the board members continued to give the go-ahead to McClendon and the management team, and the company went on to obtain solid land positions in other less familiar shale plays. Then, under McClendon's strategy, Chesapeake laid off a good portion of the eventual costs of these deals via minority joint-venture ownerships and earned drilling arrangements with those late-to-the-party guests that still needed positions in active plays. Financial and operational risks were thus substantially reduced by these moves, and solid values in acreage and expected reserves were obtained at relatively low-cost.None of this information is totally new, but it's fascinating to see it laid out clearly by someone who saw it develop from the inside -- and helped approve the strategy. Now, though, the board is pulling back the reins on McClendon.In just the past couple of days, Fitch and Standard & Poor's have cut their ratings of Chesapeake's stock. S&P explained it was because of the revelations about McClendon's attempted billion dollar borrowing to get a share of profit from wells. \"Turmoil resulting from these developments -- and from potential revelations resulting from the board investigation -- could hamper Chesapeake's ability to meet the massive external funding requirements stemming from its currently weak operating cash flow and aggressive capital spending.\" An analysis by Reuters chimes in: \"investors should also be wary of the company's monstrous complexity. It has convoluted off-balance sheet liabilities thanks to convoluted partnerships; hedging gains have dwarfed profit since 2006; and cash flow is consistently negative.\" It doesn't sound good for them.By the way, Maxwell is an industry veteran who is deeply worried about peak oil -- hence his showing up as one of a few dozen experts in Peak Oil Personalities. In the book, in addition to talking about Chesapeake (and much more), he gives his own oil forecast. I wish he'd gone into his reasons for this outlook as much as he went into the details on Chesapeake, but in any case, here's what he says:... oil (sometimes called hydrocarbon liquids) may reach a peak of production in the period 2015-2020. I'm betting this will look more like a rough plateau. Then, after 2020, I would expect oil output to begin to gently sink... there will be public pain attached to any combination of solutions.We're running out of time to achieve any kind of easy transition, Maxwell argues, so prices will likely soar, pushing people to find solutions of one kind or another. \"This is an outcome many will protest. But this late in the game, I see no other way out.\""}, {"title": "Do Lawns Contribute to Climate Change?", "text": "Do lawns contribute to climate change? Grass is a plant, and through photosynthesis, it takes up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and if we sequester it, we help remove this gas from the atmosphere. However, the maintenance of turfgrass takes a good deal of energy -- think of mowing, watering, and applying fertilizers that all consume fossil fuels. The net balance between sequestration and emission may actually demonstrate that lawns release more greenhouse gases than they sequester.Using actual data from measurements of trees found on different land use types in Florida (e.g., parks, residential yards, and natural urban remnants), we calculated the source/sink potential of a 4 hectare (9.88 acres) sites in three Florida cities (Gainesville, Orlando, Miami). Only above-ground vegetation values were calculated; soils and below ground organic matter were not included in the calculations.The take home message is that highly maintained lawns and trees sequester much less carbon dioxide than more natural areas with little maintenance. With more lawn cover than tree canopy cover, the balance can actually shift to emitting carbon dioxide (e.g., older residential areas in Miami-Dade). Of note is that we did not calculate the impact of built surfaces, just vegetative. The calculations were simplified as we did not add the carbon cost of making and maintaining the power equipment or the carbon cost of growing and transporting sod. In particular, we did not calculate the emission of nitrous oxide from fertilization applications. Urban turfgrass typically emits nitrous oxide after fertilization and/or irrigation. Nitrous oxide has a much worse global warming potential (GWP) as its heat-absorbing potential is approximately 300 times more than carbon dioxide. With these unmeasured factors, city parks with high maintenance regimes may have much larger impacts than reported here. Thus, urban areas that have a large amount of mowed, irrigated, fertilized lawns and pruned shrubs and trees can be a source of carbon dioxide rather than a sink. These carbon dioxide emissions are not trivial; for example, a 4-hectare greenspace in Miami-Dade with 85 percent of the land covered in lawn would emit over 11 tons of carbon dioxide per year.Further, because below-ground soil carbon sequestration was not calculated, full carbon credit could not be assessed and these above-ground numbers reported should be regarded as a first look at the potential carbon value of urban greenspace. At this stage, natural greenspaces in and around urban areas, with little to no maintenance, seem to be the best option for carbon dioxide sequestration. Natural urban greenspaces also have other benefits, such as biodiversity conservation, reduced stormwater runoff, and reduced fertilizer applications. Overall, the conservation of urban open space could play a role in reducing Florida's carbon footprint, but highly maintained urban greenspace could be regarded as a source of greenhouse gases. In relation to cities trying to reduce their carbon footprint, these results indicate that if municipalities and developers are to use greenspaces as carbon dioxide sinks, they will have to justify the creation of such high-maintenance parks and may have to mitigate their effects."}, {"title": "Turning 40: Avoiding a Midlife Crisis for the Clean Water Act", "text": "Landmark legislation like the Clean Water Act doesn't need a red hot convertible to celebrate turning 40, but it does need some new policy wheels to help it avoid a midlife crisis. Today, as this environmental safeguard inches closer to its birthday, the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers are proposing a revised guidance to provide greater clarity for the Clean Water Act. The guidance, which is currently under final review by the Office of Management and Budget, will also help restore long-standing protections for waterways across the country. At risk are wetlands and streams that sustain communities, businesses and fish and wildlife in the Chesapeake Bay, Mississippi River Delta, Prairie Pothole region, Missouri River Basin and throughout the country. Protecting these precious waters protects our health, our economy, wildlife and a way of life for hunters, anglers, campers, outdoors enthusiasts and all Americans who enjoy clean water.Before the Clean Water Act, pollution was so bad that water bodies like the Cuyahoga River in Ohio and the Charles River in Massachusetts caught on fire faster than a batch of birthday candles. The Charles River is even featured in an aptly named song called \"Dirty Water,\" a 1960s hit by the Standells.In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in order to cleanup these nasty, noxious combustible rivers, lakes and streams. Lawmakers also wanted to stem the destruction of wetlands vital for flood control, drinking water and wildlife habitat.Over the years, muddy Supreme Court rulings and cloudy agency guidance added confusion over the scope of the Clean Water Act. As a result, there are unresolved questions about what waters and wetlands should be protected under the law. This includes small local streams that provide tap water, food, jobs and recreation.Now is the time to resolve and strengthen safeguards for resources none of us can live without. Finalizing the guidance will help avoid a confusing midlife crisis for the Clean Water Act by affirming longstanding protections and providing greater clarity for developers, land owners, conservationists and state and federal agencies. A final guidance should also be followed up with a rule-making to give the Clean Water Act more vigor and longevity so that it can keep our waters drinkable, swimmable and fire-free for another 40 years and more."}, {"title": "5 Reasons a 'Global Cattle Drive' to China Is a Bad Idea", "text": "The Wall Street Journal reports that China is importing 100,000 heifers -- 25 ships' worth -- to boost domestic dairy production in the wake of melamine and other milk-powder scandals that have decimated China's relatively small dairy industry since 2008.Where to begin? There are so many problems with this scenario, but here are just five reasons why this is a terribly bad idea:1) The cows are destined for factory farms. China may be importing the cattle from Uruguay, Australia and New Zealand, but they are importing the model for factory farming from the U.S. The animals' long nightmare starts on a harrowing journey overseas in ships, where they are confined tightly and face multiple health issues that may result in death. Those buried at sea might be the luckiest cattle, because once the animals get through the 45-day quarantine, they will continue their confinement in \"football-field-size sheds\" that resemble electronics factories more than farms and are milked three times a day on \"bovine merry-go-rounds,\" according to Wall Street Journal reporter Alex Frangos.The Chinese government has created tax incentives and other policies that favor investors in big dairies. These facilities will widgetize animals in the same model that China has used for electronics and other manufacturing sectors that have made the country an export powerhouse. But the factory farm model has been a failure for public health, the environment and animal welfare in the U.S., just like it will be in China. The only people who will benefit are the investors who aim to concentrate Chinese dairy production.2) It's bad for Chinese farmers and relies on genetically modified feed. Policies that favor factory farms and the economic concentration of food production in the hands of a few small producers is bad for Chinese farmers and consumers who want local, farm-raised food. The U.S. factory farm model has already been exported to Europe, thanks to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that has made it very difficult for small farms to thrive. They're even forced to import genetically engineered soy feed because there are no more local feed markets that can compete with these cheap yet dangerous imports.3) Essential resources are being traded away for profit. A New Zealand farmer was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying that selling the country's strong milk producers is like \"selling the family silver, you can only do it once.\" Farmers like Roma Britnell in Australia are selling to Chinese buyers because of the good price and income, which helped her pay down the debt on her farm. Like so-called land grabs, where fertile land is sold out from under farmers and peasants by foreign interests, this is a resource grab that New Zealand's dairy farmers may come to regret if China is successful in becoming a dairy powerhouse.4) It's already affecting farmers elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal reports that the price of alfalfa, the preferred feedstock for dairy cows, has gone through the roof. Since China doesn't produce it, it needs to import it from the U.S., where the price has doubled in the past year thanks to increased Chinese demand. This is an extra expense for U.S. dairy farmers who are already squeezed thanks to low dairy prices and industry consolidation that favors the biggest producers.5) This does nothing to address real food safety problems in China. The effort to create a booming domestic dairy industry is a nice PR effort, but by favoring factory farms it won't make the Chinese food system any safer. Further consolidating the food system is a sure-fire way to increase the chance that a problem in one facility can make it halfway around the world before a problem is even detected.Policies like these that import heifers from around the globe to fuel China's factory farms are just further proof that globalization and the industrialized food system have gone too far.This was originally posted at Food & Water Watch's blog."}, {"title": "Reversing Deforestation Is Complicated; Planting a Tree Is Simple", "text": "Acceptance Speech for the Arbor Day Foundation Vision Award April 28, 2012 Nebraska City, NebraskaThank you all very much, not only for this very kind recognition of Maryland's environmental leadership and positive choices, but thank you also for the great work of the Arbor Day Foundation.

When's the best time to plant a tree?\" Her grandfather says, \"Well, it takes time for those roots to go deep and for branches to spread... and so the most important time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.\" And the little girl asks, \"Well, when is the next best time to plant a tree?\" The grandfather responds:\"Right now.\"The vital connection between our forests and our children's future has never been more important, or more threatened, than it is right now.Together for the last several thousand years we have been co-authors with Creation of the emerging story of the Earth -- that fundamental truth that gives context to the story of our shared humanity. But right now the Earth, which determined its own movement forward over these millennia, is seeing its immediate future determined by the choices and actions of us -- of human beings: the one species most capable of manipulating our environment, and the only species intellectually capable of free choice.Reversing deforestation is complicated; planting a tree is simple.The essential question for us, right now, is whether we have the capacity to grow.In Maryland we consider ourselves pro-growth Americans.You see, we believe in growing jobs, and growing opportunity. Like you, we believe in children growing healthy, growing educated, and growing strong. We believe in grandparents growing old with dignity and love. Like you we believe in growing trees, growing stream buffers, growing food for a hungry world.Together, we are called upon to accomplish what Thomas Berry called, \"The Great Work\"; what Aldo Leopold described as the evolutionary development of a third great ethic -- the Ethic of Land.It is the work of healing and restoring the common good we share with all natural beings. Growing in our mindfulness... growing in our awareness,.. growing in our understanding of the balance we must rediscover and reconcile with the other living systems of this one Earth -- the Earth we choose to share, or not share, with future generations.Human choices have become terribly powerful things on this finite globe... smart, green and growingFor Maryland we choose a future that is smart, green, and growing.We choose to plant trees, to grow oysters, to restore the blue crab.With science, the Internet, and SmartMaps, we choose to protect our Open Space; to map and restore our Greenprint; to defend and protect our Agprint; to monitor and restore our Streamhealth.Upgrading to better sewage treatment technology; implementing better farming practices; employing better, more sustainable forestry management.Creating a future with no net forest loss; ensuring that 40 percent of all land in our State is covered by trees and forests by the year 2020.Protecting high quality forests, encouraging the retention of working lands, and promoting family-owned forest stewardship.Environmental Literacy.Bay-stat.Restorative Justice.Conservation by Design.We choose to do all of these things, and we choose to do them... right now.For as a great man once observed, \"... there is an absolute direction to growth...

Newkirk on the new release of her radicalizing book Free the Animals.For those of you who didn't read the book when it first came out 20 years ago, Free the Animals is written like a novel you might take to the beach or on a plane, but it's meaty and juicy inside. It tells the riveting, real-life story of the people who put on disguises, use fake IDs or jimmy their way into laboratories in order to carry out the daring rescues of animals used in experiments and of the insiders, the whistleblowers, who risk their jobs to help them. One of those rescues involved Britches, an infant macaque monkey who had his eyes stitched closed and some kind of electrical box put on his head in a really lame and truly bizarre experiment. When PETA released photographs of Britches with his eyelids sewn shut, it was a PR nightmare for his tormentors, who switched to doing more benign things -- not as benign as, say, knitting, but at least they stopped using baby monkeys.Which brings us to something else that's changed since the book was first released: the widespread awareness that writing letters to your member of Congress isn't enough and that bold action is needed to get animals out of laboratories, where dogs and rabbits are treated as though they were pieces of lab equipment. That's something that the surprisingly normal members of the Animal Liberation Front discovered and is discussed in Free the Animals.One of those labs, SEMA, was the site of a 1987 nighttime raid that blew the lid off the abysmal conditions for chimpanzees in laboratories. Video footage taken inside the facility revealed that baby chimpanzees were locked alone inside steel boxes so restrictive that these social animals banged their heads against the solid walls over and over again.Much has changed, yet much remains the same in a world as large as ours. In one recent experiment at BIOQUAL, a biomedical research laboratory, six chimpanzees -- as young as 2 years old -- were taken from their mothers, caged, and exposed to norovirus, which causes diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. What followed were months of painful biopsies in which bits of their organs were cut out. Don't tell me there's no other way, because there are lots of other ways to test cosmetics, floor cleaner and new drugs, to develop medicines and to show our military medics how to fix up injured soldiers on the battlefield. We just have to change our old habits and switch to new, modern ones.Some people may still think it's OK to burn, shock, poison, starve, drown, and inflict brain damage on animals in laboratories, but polls show that the majority of us don't. We've evolved. We don't think it's acceptable to keep monkeys constantly thirsty to make them cooperate in exchange for a sip of juice or to force mice to swim to the point of exhaustion and drowning in order to simulate human depression. Thanks to video footage taken inside laboratories by PETA during undercover investigations, the entire public perception of animal experimentation has changed, and we want a better, more humane bang for our buck.What the ALF was demanding and what even people who think it adventurous to send a postcard to L'Oreal asking the company not to test on animals are demanding is a switch to sophisticated non-animal research that typically takes less time to complete, is more applicable to humans, and costs only a fraction of the amount needed to feed a lab full of baboons and hire people to clean up their poop.In the two decades since Free the Animals was first published, PETA has gotten animal experimenters prosecuted, persuaded hundreds of companies to stop testing products on animals, convinced government agencies to change testing requirements, convinced many facilities to use computerized manikins instead of animals for medical training exercises, funded the development of non-animal research methods for toxicity testing, convinced multiple airlines to stop shipping animals to labs, and much more.Even scientists are catching on to the fact that torturing animals to try to fix human problems doesn't make sense. Last year, the Institute of Medicine released a landmark report concluding that \"most current biomedical research use of chimpanzees is not necessary,\" and the National Nurses Association switched from cat intubation to human simulators. None of this would have been possible -- or even imaginable -- 20 years ago.It's wrong to condemn dogs, mice, monkeys, and rabbits to a living death and constant fear by putting them in cold metal cages in a lab somewhere and treating them as if they don't matter. If you agree, and I hope you do, read Free the Animals -- it's an easy and absolutely thrilling read -- and then visit PETA.org to learn what's changed in the last 20 years, what still needs to be done, and how you can help."}, {"title": "Nuclear Safety Advocates Accuse Industry And Regulators Of Foot-Dragging On Basic Safety Measure", "text": "From her home, Mary Lampert, 70, has a clear view of the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, which sits just across the Duxbury and Plymouth Bays in coastal Massachusetts. The proximity, Lampert says, lends itself to a good deal of contemplating \"what ifs.\" Among these: what if the Pilgrim plant experienced a meltdown like the one that unfolded just over a year ago in Fukushima, Japan?  \"I live just six miles from that plant across open water,\" says Lampert, a staunch advocate for tougher oversight of the nuclear power industry. \"It always comes down to public safety versus the cost to industry of implementing something.\"So it has been, Lampert argues, with one seemingly straightforward emergency feature: Requiring a filtered vent in the concrete containment buildings surrounding nuclear reactors like the one at Pilgrim.Such a vent would come into play in only the worst sort of emergency, when the usual means for keeping the reactor core cool are lost and things inside are heating up to the point of becoming explosive. Operators can then open the vent and exhale the pressure directly into the air. The filter would capture dangerous radioactivity, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area.Until now, vents have been an optional feature for American plant operators, but in March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued its first orders since undertaking a review of safety systems and procedures at American plants in the aftermath of the disaster in Japan. Among the orders was a requirement that reactors of similar pedigree to those used at Fukushima should have containment vents installed. For reactors that already have them, steps should be taken to ensure they operate in an emergency, officials declared.To the dismay of Lampert and others, however, regulators have not required filters, at least not yet. The order left the matter open for further discussion.Not everyone agrees that the investment in filtered containment vents, and the marginal benefits they would afford, is worth the cost. In a document providing guidance to plant operators analyzing various alternatives for mitigating severe accidents, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's main lobbying group, put the value of such an investment at precisely zero.But nuclear safety advocates say the industry's desire to minimize costs results in an overly narrow view of worthwhile safety measures.Pilgrim Watch, a nuclear safety group headed up by Lampert, filed a challenge to the NRC's vent order earlier this month. Meanwhile, a public meeting to discuss guidelines for the vents -- including the advantages and disadvantages of filters -- is scheduled for Wednesday at NRC headquarters in Rockville, Md.NRC staff is expected to issue guidance on the filters by July.Just how much the introduction of such filters might cost the industry is unclear. The order issued by the NRC concerns just a fraction of the nation's 104 nuclear power reactors, including 23 so-called Mark I reactors and eight Mark IIs. The 2005 NEI guidance document put the price tag of a filtered vent at $3 million, but a spokesman for the NEI said that was an old number dating to 1994 and \"for a component that is not seismically designed,\" as would be required now.Dale Klein, a former NRC commissioner who now sits on the board of directors of an Arizona energy conglomerate, suggested in an email that the price for a system might be on the order of $15 million. A contract to install a filtered venting system at a plant in Romania was valued at about $48 million.Areva and Westinghouse, two companies that manufacture and sell filtered vent technology, declined to provide price estimates for their systems, citing a wide range of engineering variables.Advocates say that whatever the real cost, the benefits of forestalling widespread contamination of areas around a troubled nuclear power plant are significantly higher.\"It's baffling that any one would even contemplate not filtering the gases released during severe accidents,\" says David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and longtime advocate of nuclear safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Under such conditions, the likelihood that these gases would contain huge amounts of radioactivity approaches 100 percent. So in a situation when the gases contain the highest levels of radioactivity, we will release them with the least amount of protection for the workers and the public.\"Discussion of vents on nuclear power plants, particularly on so-called boiling water reactors, which often have smaller, less-robust containment systems, is nothing new. Frank Von Hippel, a former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology, noted in an essay in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last year that the idea has been around since at least the late 1970s.Von Hippel himself advocated for the devices in an article following the accident at a reactor at Three Mile Island, near Middletown, Pa., in 1979.\"I don't understand why it hasn't been done,\" Von Hippel told The Huffington Post. \"I guess it's just that they say, 'Don't worry, a meltdown won't happen, so we don't need to add yet another layer of protection.'\"Well, I have a different cost-benefit analysis than the industry does,\" he added, \"and the NRC should as well.\"A task force created by the NRC after the Fukushima accident to develop recommendations for potential safety upgrades in the U.S. quickly identified containment vents as a top priority. The four reactors at Fukushima had unfiltered containment vents similar to those already installed at most of the 23 Mark I reactors in the United States, but amid the unfolding catastrophe, investigators have suggested that plant operators may have initially delayed using the vents, for fear of contaminating the area before it was fully evacuated.Later, when Japanese operators finally attempted to use the vents, some of them malfunctioned, and the high levels of radiation made it difficult to open them manually, possibly contributing to hydrogen explosions inside the containment buildings. Such explosions, which can result in an uncontrolled release of radioactive gases, are precisely what the vent systems are designed to forestall.Japanese nuclear regulators have now required the installation of hardened vents that can function properly and predictably under all conceivable scenarios, including power loss. They also have required that the vents include filters, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area.Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, suggested in a telephone interview that part of the problem in the United States is that the risk models used by the agency to gauge the value of regulatory measures have mostly been concerned with preventing or limiting direct human exposure to radiation. \"That's the nuts and bolts of how we think about safety,\" he said.The use of a containment vent would come as nearly a last resort in an emergency situation, Jaczko explained, long after multiple and redundant safety schemes had failed, and well after any surrounding population had been evacuated from the area.In the traditional calculus, adding a filter would do little to further inoculate against human exposures.But Jaczko, whose reputation as a reformer has put him at odds with his more industry-friendly fellow commissioners, has begun advocating for a broader view of risk -- one that includes not just human exposures, but the possibility of widespread contamination of the surrounding environment.\"We also want to begin thinking about what happens when the people are gone, and you have contamination that keeps people out of their homes, or keeps businesses in the area from being able operate, sometimes for 20 or 30 years,\" Jaczko said.Regardless of how remote the possibility is that vents would be needed -- the Fukushima disaster was the first time in the history of nuclear power that such vents were put to the test -- weighing questions of broader environmental contamination would seem to argue for installation of filters. Jaczko cautioned, however, that they were not a panacea and that NRC staff were carefully examining the issue ahead of issuing guidance in July.Asked whether the commission spoke with one voice on these issues, Jaczko said, \"The commission does, but the individual commissioners don't. There's been a lot of differences and discussions about the right way to approach these things,\" he said.Jim Riccio, a nuclear analyst with Greenpeace, said delays on filters are unacceptable. \"If you're going to try to save the reactor by dropping radiation on the public, I want it filtered,\" he said.Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, would only say that the nuclear power industry was examining the issue of filters.\"When the U.S. nuclear energy industry last spring created a leadership structure to integrate and coordinate our ongoing response to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, we reiterated our commitment to ensuring safety at U.S. reactors informed by lessons derived from Fukushima,\" Kerekes said in an email message. \"It is within this context that the subject of filtered vents is being evaluated.\"Kerekes refused repeated requests to discuss the matter any further.Mary Lampert, however, is undeterred, arguing that the vents are just one of many aspects of nuclear power safety that need to be upgraded. She ticked off a list of nations where filtered containment vents are now required.\"If filtered vents are good enough for Sweden, if they are good enough for Germany, if they are good enough for France and for Switzerland,\" she said, \"they should be good enough for us.\""}, {"title": "PHOTOS: Functional Decor Made From Natural Fibers", "text": "Antoine Fritsch and Vivien Durisotti, the creative minds behind the innovative design agency Fritsch-Durisotti, were always inspired by natural materials.

A topic of controversy for the last number of years, hydraulic fracturing (a.k.a. fracking) has become a serious concern among citizens, particularly in the Northeastern United States. In this interview, Barbara Arrindell, Director of Damascus Citizens for Sustainability (DCS), one of the organizations behind the I HEART H2O PSA, shares the 101 on natural gas exploration.Summer Rayne Oakes: Give us the 101 on fracking for those of our readers who might misinterpret it for Urban Dictionary's ribald definition?Barbara Arrindell: Hate to say it but hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" is an even dirtier term than what's presented in Urban Dictionary. It is used to describe a method of drilling into the earth to obtain natural gas, using toxic drilling muds, high volumes of water with tons of chemicals -- some known and some unknown -- and very high pressure to fissure and break geological layers to shake the gas loose.  SRO: So the natural gas industries haven't been able to \"charm\" the gas up from it's 400 million year old resting place using less invasive methods?BA: Not at all. And natural gas exploration is exempt from our current legislative laws like the Safe Drinking Water Act, which was designed to protect our nation's public drinking water supply. So it seems that the one thing that the natural gas industry has been able to charm are our politicians.SRO: That is dirty indeed. Isn't there something called the FRAC Act that was currently reintroduced to the Senate and House of Representatives?BA: Yes, but the FRAC Act, (which stands for Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals), only removes about one and a half of the loopholes for the natural gas industries.SRO: Which ones are those?BA: Well, it removes the exemption for oil and gas exploration and production from the Safe Drinking Water Act -- and part of the Community Right to Know Act, which provides the public and local governments with information concerning potential chemical hazards present in their communities. The FRAC Act will not halt drilling or even require any additional permits. It will possibly put liability for some damages back on the drillers, but until then the citizens living in affected areas AND DOWNSTREAM will have to foot the bill.  SRO: What's the status of the FRAC Act?BA: It is currently stuck in committees. The FRAC Act will be a good first step if we can get it passed. It's important to encourage your senators and congresspeople to support it, but they need to hear from their citizens. American Rivers has an easy way for you to do so here, but I encourage anyone to be more proactive and actually write, call or visit with your Representative or Senator.SRO: I hear an awful lot in the media that \"natural gas is a cheap energy alternative.\" However, Amory Lovins, Chairman of the Rocky Mountain Institute, mentioned in the Sustainable Operations Summit this past week that natural gas isn't all that cheap, especially considering price volatility and other externalities. Tell us about the costs associated right now with fracking.BA: Amory is right on the price volatility front -- but it's also a question of how long the supplies will last. The decline rate of fracked gas wells is very steep -- only 15 percent remains in two years -- so they have to keep on drilling new wells. The wells are expensive and most of the companies are losing money on each well, which means as stockholders keep on giving them more money, they spend it and it's clear that the bubble will eventually burst.  SRO: So who pays the bills if your water gets contaminated?BA: The general public or you personally. Listen, the true costs of natural gas exploration and extraction are completely disregarded. External damages are rarely covered by the natural gas industries because they don't need to.What the general public doesn't realize is that they [public citizens] are the ones footing the bills. For example, all equity in any area where the water is contaminated is lost. Try selling your home with contaminated water -- or with a view of a fracking mine behind your house. It's next to impossible.If the water is contaminated, it is the citizens that will have to pay for their own clean water -- and that may mean traveling to the supermarket to get bottled water, or in many cases, having to have it trucked in from somewhere else where the water is not contaminated. Plus there are health impacts and mounting medical bills, which aren't factored into the equation.SRO: I'm sure all of that information is not included in the pamphlet you get when the natural gas industry says they'll pay you upfront to frack your land.BA: The true costs are never disclosed. You want to play Russian Roulette with your water quality and property value? You want to potentially be sued by your neighbor for destroying their water supply because he/she had foresight not to sell fracking rights to the natural gas companies? Those are some of the risks you run. Not to mention playing Russian Roulette with your health.  SRO: In the 1970s, the Eastern Gas Shales Project conducted by the Department of Energy found a wealth of natural gas locked up tightly far beneath the ground in shale rock formations -- the same gas that is being exploited today. One of the many problems as I see it is that the technologies to extract those fuels didn't (and still don't) consider the human and environmental impact of the toxic fracking fluids. What do you think?BA: All of the toxic fracking fluids are a definite cause for concern -- but also something to consider is the fact that the hydraulic fracturing technique permanently shatters the underground geology and can connect gas bearing layers with water bearing layers.There is so little fresh drinkable water on the planet and this technique breaks the geological barriers that have protected fresh water aquifers and the surface for millennia. The human and environmental impact is being ignored -- and yes, those very large volumes of fracking fluids left underground will move and are already moving and contaminating aquifers and surface waters.SRO: Speaking of that -- Josh Fox's Gasland and youtube provide hours of sick enjoyment of watching people in fracking-affected areas light their water on fire due to the flammable chemical concoctions, which no pun intended. It blows my mind. What do you think it'll take for people and the government to realize that this is seriously Fracked up?BA: What it will take is a lot of screaming -- and demanding -- and educating everyone. Young people, my generation and those who are yet to be born cannot live with this rolling disaster taking and spoiling our water and air.   SRO: So if we had a list of demands, what would it look like?BA: We must demand that the cumulative impacts are looked at. That proper legislation be in place so that the industry is held accountable if they destroy water and air quality -- and that the huge subsidies are ended.We must use the already developed non-carbon and non-nuclear solutions. This can be done by 2030. We are so creative, and if given the opportunity, we can switch to sustainable and renewable fuels very quickly if the demand and will to do it is there.SRO: Alright, so what can each individual do?BA: Be aware, get your local community engaged, help the organizations working on this issue. And like I said before, it's important to encourage your senators and congresspeople to support the FRAC Act, demand and be very critical when listening to rosy predictions from those promoting gas drilling."}, {"title": "Rocket Trike Diaries: Week Four", "text": "Welcome to ROCKET TRIKE DIARIES -- a 10 week video tour of the 2011 \"Ride for Renewables: No Tar Sands Oil On American Soil!\" Join Renewable Rider Tom Weis as he pedals his rocket trike 2,150 miles through America's heartland in support of landowners fighting TransCanada's toxic Keystone XL tar sands pipeline scheme.

While I don't see much concern for the future in Washington, I do see it here in New York City. It is easy to see in the city's ambitious capital budget and in Mayor Bloomberg's path-breaking PlaNYC 2030 sustainability strategy.Recently I had the pleasure of moderating a panel discussion of New York City's sustainability initiatives at the Sustainable Operations Summit. Two of my panelists were leaders in New York City's government: Janette Sadik-Khan, Commissioner of Transportation, and David Bragdon, Director of the Mayor's Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability. At one point in the discussion, I asked them how we could be sure that New York's sustainability programs would survive the mayoral transition that will come in January 2014. They reminded me that many aspects of the city's plan were now codified by law, and would be required of future mayors. Mayor Bloomberg has managed to hard-wire this part of his legacy into New York's routine operation. Perhaps more important, New York's mayor had demonstrated that sustainability is not a fringe concept, but one promoted by a pragmatic and successful businessman-mayor.In industry and at the local level of American government, I see a growing understanding of the sustainability agenda. That agenda demonstrates the connection between environmental protection and economic well-being. Here in New York City, the signs of this gathering consensus can be seen in the growth of local green markets, green buildings, bike lanes, tree planting and green infrastructure. The sustainability consensus is becoming institutionalized in local law and even in changes to the city's zoning rules. In a story about \"green zoning\" by New York Times reporter Mireya Navarro, she notes that:The new regulations would encourage better insulation by allowing buildings to add up to eight inches of thickness to exterior walls without its being counted in the building's maximum footprint. Other changes would relax height limits and facade restrictions to make room for equipment like solar panels, wind turbines, awnings, green roofs, recreational decks and skylights.This type of law might be seen as a second generation sustainability policy enhancement, and the type of change that can transform grand policy pronouncements into specific investments and actions. Energy efficiency is one of the most common sense elements of the sustainability agenda. It is hard to argue that an organization or a family is better off if they spend money on energy that they do not use.Another visible change in New York City has been the growing number of bike lanes. While some local merchants and cab drivers don't like the lanes that have been constructed on main thoroughfares (such as Columbus Avenue), New Yorkers are voting with their pedals and in increasing numbers using bicycles for transportation and recreation. The New York City Department of Transportation tracks commuter cycling and reports a 289% increase between 2001 and 2011. In fact, commuter cycling grew 8% from 2010 to 2011. Of equal and perhaps even greater importance is that the increase in bike traffic been accompanied by an increase in bike safety. According to DOT, since 2000 there has been a \"72% decrease in the average risk of a serious injury experienced by commuter cyclists in New York City.\"Mayor Bloomberg's PlaNYC 2030 sustainability strategy is also undergoing \"second generation\" changes, including a proposal to use green infrastructure to attack the city's combined sewer overflow problem and an emphasis on reducing the city's reliance on landfills for solid waste disposal. New York City has also been working to encourage development of more science and technology research as a way to incubate high tech industry. NYU is adding to its growing Brooklyn engineering campus, Cornell is coming to Roosevelt Island, and Columbia is building a new center for the study of mind, brain and behavior on its new campus on the far upper west side of Manhattan. New York City is continuing its transformation from a center of manufacture and trade to a city of services, entertainment and ideas.The role of a place like New York in the global economy is very much a work in progress, as is the role of the United States in the global economy. We are fortunate in New York that so far in the 21st century, we've had a mayor who has understood the need to look ahead and invest in the future. The city's capital commitments from FY 2010-2014 total over $46 billion. This does not include capital spent by the Port Authority, or by the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Agency. Unfortunately the federal government does not have a capital budget. The annual budget includes long term and short term spending and the federal deficit includes both debt service and annual overspending. At the federal level it is hard to tell what part of the deficit is overspending and what part is a capital investment in the future. Fortunately, local governments are required to separate their investments and annual spending in two distinct budgets: one for annual expenditures and a second for long term capital investments. Local governments must be sure that their debt service is a reasonable and affordable proportion of the total annual expenditure budget. While Bloomberg has increased investment in the future he has done a good job of ensuring that the city's annual payment on its bonds remain an affordable percentage of New York City's over $60 billion annual budget. There is a wide consensus that New York's schools, roads, water and waste systems require constant investment.There is also a consensus that we must pay as we go. We tried doing it the other way in the 1970's and it nearly drove us into bankruptcy. New York City has high taxes and high investment. We have a wide variety of fees and taxes, including taxes on income, sales, and property. Unlike a typical local government in the United States, we are not primarily dependent on property taxes. While people do leave New York City because of its higher taxes, in this century more have moved here than have left. People come here to take advantage of the city's economic opportunities and quality of life. About 40% of the people who live in New York City were born in other countries. The idea that high taxes can kill economic dynamism is disproven by New York City. I am not arguing that this place is heaven on earth. It's not. There is too much poverty, pollution, pain and poorly performing schools to feel that way. But in New York, our capitalists seem to understand that the market alone cannot solve these problems. In fact, our billionaire mayor is a master at bringing government, private and nonprofit organizations together to solve pressing problems.I believe that it is a concern for the future that motivates the city's sustainability plan and its capital budget. New York City remains a place of tremendous appeal for ambitious people from every corner of the globe and every state of the union. Somehow the word continues to get out. To me it sounds a lot like Alicia Keys when she delivers this compelling verse from Jay-Z, Angela Hunte and Jane't Sewell-Ulepic:New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of. There's nothin' you can't do. Now you're in New York. These streets will make you feel brand new. Big lights will inspire you. Let's hear it for New York.Work, create, save, tax, invest and sustain. There is no free lunch and you get what you pay for. I think that is Mike Bloomberg's sustainability state of mind."}, {"title": "Should Dow Get a Veto Over Government Scientists?", "text": "A relatively obscure Congressional hearing on Tuesday became a flashpoint in a very important conflict: the attempt by the chemical industry -- led by Dow Chemical -- to gain a veto over the work of government scientists. This time, however, the scientists fought back, and they need our support.The hearing was a joint project of the House Small Business Committee and House Science Committee. It focused on how a government report on cancer-causing chemicals is hurting \"small business\" in America. The Report on Carcinogens, which recently classified formaldehyde as a \"known carcinogen\" and styrene as a \"reasonably anticipated\" human carcinogen was under attack. It is a statutorily mandated report that is prepared by the highly respected National Toxicology Program (NTP).The hearing is part of a disturbing pattern of political intimidation of government scientists for doing their jobs. Companies that make and use both chemicals launched an attack on the report even before it was published and its publication was delayed for years. It took political courage for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to allow the report to be released, and I was told phones rang off the hook at the White House from chemical industry lobbyists complaining about the decision.The Report itself does not restrict the chemicals it names. The findings can be used by regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency to decide if any changes are needed to environmental rules, but they mostly inform the public and the marketplace. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that its safety data sheets be updated when the Report lists a chemical, a basic right-to-know measure for American workers.So what was Dow complaining about at Tuesday's hearing? Dow's chief scientist Jim Bus effectively said that the NTP doesn't do good science. Dow does good science. And the agency needs to give Dow and other companies a greater say in determinations like this for them to be credible with the public.Never mind that the woman who runs the NTP and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences -- Dr. Linda Birnbaum -- is perhaps the most credentialed person on the planet on these matters. Never mind the exhaustive peer-review and outside consultation that already takes place. No, we need Dow more involved, because the public certainly thinks chemical makers are more credible judges of the products they make than public health scientists whose only mandate is to identify substances that may be harming public health.The arrogance and self-serving nature of Dow's position was breath-taking, but the upside of the hearing was that it was also obvious and fell flat. Representative Brad Miller (D-NC) deserves special credit for blowing the whistle on the hearing, by pointing out that the styrene industry took credit for the fact that the hearing was taking place. Miller and Representatives Richmond (D-LA) and Tonko (D-NY) pointed out that industry opponents who would exonerate styrene and formaldehyde were hardly more credible than the NTP. Overall, the show trial intended by the hearing backfired on the inquisitors, Subcommittee Chairs Broun (R-GA) and Ellmers (R-NC).But the issue requires continued vigilance. Already, the United States has lost the leadership of the world on health and safety issues in favor of the European Union, and that has an impact on our ability to compete in a world market that increasingly demands safer products. The modest attempts by EPA Administrator Jackson to restore that leadership have not only been undermined by House Republicans but in some cases by industry allies in the White House who have blocked key reforms. The attempt to politically intimidate Dr. Birnbaum would bring this trend to a new low, however, because it would signal that companies like Dow can block even the most basic scientific work from seeing the light of day when it offends them.So please ask your member of Congress to support the independence of government scientists like Dr. Birnbaum at the NTP, but please also take a moment to tell Dow to back off and let government scientists do their job."}, {"title": "Fragile Earth App Depicts Impact Of Climate Change On Planet (PHOTOS)", "text": "By Natasha BakerTORONTO (Reuters) - Whether it is melting glaciers, coastal erosion or drying lakes, a new app displays the impact of climate change on the planet by using before and after satellite images.Called Fragile Earth, the app for iPhone and iPad shows how our planet is impacted by global warming by featuring more than 70 sites such the receding Muir Glacier in Alaska, the impact of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the draining of the Mesopotamia Marshes in Iraq.\"We don't necessarily put an opinion on it,\" said Jethro Lennox, head of publishing at Collins Geo, a division of Harper Collins UK which created the app. \"We're just trying to visually portray some of the geographical features and changes around the world.\"The app also shows the impact of natural disasters including the devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Pakistan and the tsunami in Japan, and how mining, deforestation and dam building have changed areas of the planet.Users of the app slide birds-eye photographs depicting before and after states of environmental changes.\"When you're looking at the earth changing, it's almost surprising and it shows how amazing the place is,\" said Lennox. \"For years glaciers have been retreating and advancing, and we don't really know exactly why this is taking place. But the rate of some of these changes is amazing.\"Lennox said that some of the most astounding images are of the Aral Sea, which was once the world's fourth-largest lake but has drastically reduced in size over the past 40 years.\"We even have to change our world maps quite regularly because it changes so fast,\" he said.The app explains what is happening in the images, which Lennox thinks is part of its appeal because a user doesn't need to be a scientist to understand what is happening.It is an extension of the book \"Fragile Earth,\" which was published in 2006 and is now out of print. A second edition of the book will be published later this year.Collins Geo plans to continue to develop the app, adding more image sets and other features.Lennox said the company views apps as an important channel, especially for visual content.\"Some of the more reference and illustrative books are starting to really come alive in the app environment,\" he said.Images within the app come from a variety of sources including NASA and GeoEye, a satellite imagery company. They date from 1914 up to the present day.The app is available worldwide and costs $2.99.(Editing by Patricia Reaney)"}, {"title": "Five Natural Sites Where Humans Threaten Biodiversity (PHOTOS)", "text": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s list of World Heritage sites contains over 900 of the most important natural and cultural locations in world. Sadly, 35 of 200+ sites designated as natural World Heritage properties are considered in danger and face threats such as pollution, human armed conflict, poaching, uncontrolled urbanization, and unchecked tourism and development.Here are five locations where humans have left their mark, perhaps irreversibly damaging some of the world's most biodiverse sites.Belize Barrier Reef  Belize The largest barrier reef in North America, this World Heritage site comprises a diverse range of coastal lagoons, mangrove forests and estuaries. It is home to many threatened species -- such as marine turtles, manatees and the American marine crocodile -- as well as over 425 species of plants and more than 500 species of fish. Dangers to the site include heavy tourism and other human development in coastal areas.Kahuzi-Biega National Park  Democratic Republic of the Congo Comprising mostly tropical forest, Kahuzi-Biega National Park is named for its two extinct volcanoes: Kahuzi and Biega. The park is home to one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas, of which only about 150 individuals remain, according to UNESCO. Kahuzi-Biega National Park is situated in one of the most densely populated areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, placing its flora and fauna - including many endangered species - under constant threat.Rainforests of the Atsinanana  Madagascar This World Heritage site comprises six national parks in eastern Madagascar, one of the most biodiverse countries on the planet. The African island is home to over 12,000 endemic plant species and several primate groups, including several species of lemurs. Madagascar's Atsinanana Rainforests are a critical to the island's unique ecosystem and biodiversity, but they continue to be threatened by deforestation.Garamba National Park  Democratic Republic of the Congo Located in the northeastern part of the Congo, near the Sudanese border, Garamba National Park lies between the Nile and Zaire rivers. Savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, forests and swamps make up the landscape, which is home to animals such as elephants, giraffes, hippos, chimpanzees, leopards, lions, antelope and the extremely rare white rhino. (According to UNESCO, only about 30 white rhinos remain in the wild). Despite local conservation efforts, poaching remains a significant concern for this World Heritage site.Everglades National Park  United States This South Florida World Heritage site is the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere, the longest continuous stand of sawgrass prairie, and the most important breeding ground for wading birds in North America. Comprising freshwater marshes, tropical wetlands and seagrass ecosystems, the Everglades are home to more than 400 species of birds, 275+ species of fish, and over 800 species of land and water vertebrates. Some of these species include the Florida panther, snail kite, alligator, crocodile and manatee. However, these animals are threatened by a loss of marine habitat, and the site remains in danger due to the degradation of the entire ecosystem, thanks to agricultural and urban development, and pollution."}, {"title": "Baby Killed By Dog In Henderson, Nevada On His First Birthday (VIDEO)", "text": "A baby's first birthday party turned tragic when he was killed by the family's dog during the celebration.WARNING -- Graphic Description Below:The Las Vegas Sun reports that the 120-pound Mastiff/Rhodesian mix had never displayed any previous signs of aggression toward people, according to the family who lives in Henderson, Nev.The baby crawled over to the dog to pet him, the police reported.
