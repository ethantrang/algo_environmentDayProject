[{"title": "Shout It Out for a Solar Future", "text": "Friday, Jan. 24 is National Shout Out for Solar Day, a time for us to celebrate how far we have come with solar energy in the Bay Area and nationwide. Below are five of many reasons the future is bright when it comes to solar:1. These days, we have lots of California sunshine. Let's continue to tap into this renewable resource to power our homes and businesses.2. Last year California added more rooftop solar than in the previous three decades combined!3. The price of solar is rapidly declining, and it has never been cheaper to invest in photovoltaics.4. The solar industry is exploding and creating a new generation of green, high-quality jobs.5. Governor Jerry Brown recently reiterated his full-throated support for 33% renewable power in California by 2020. Solar is helping us get there.Already, 2014 is looking like a banner year when it comes to the spread of solar energy. Join me in giving solar a shout-out today, and join the Twitter conversation at #GoSolar."}, {"title": "How the Right Uses Environmental Law to Kill American Jobs", "text": "\"Conservative groups use environmental litigation to kill American jobs. \"No, that was not the title of the recent New York Times article about the Cape Wind offshore wind project. But it should have been.The article detailed the unfortunate story of how a local contractor, Mass Tank, lost out on a big welding job for the Cape Wind project to European offshore contractors.Why? Because the European bids were cheaper.And why is that? Because the U.S. lacks a robust and mature offshore wind industry. It has not had the opportunity to build up to scale to compete against the Europeans who have been building projects for two decades.But why is that? That is where the litigation against the Cape Wind project should have a played a bigger part in the story.For the last decade, Bill Koch, the infamous billionaire, has funded litigation to stop the Cape Wind project, because he doesn't want to see it from his Cape Cod mansion. Whether he also wants to kill off renewable power because his wealth comes from fossil fuels is almost beside the point.And what kind of litigation strategies is the conservative Mr. Koch pursuing? Just the kind of legal strategies that the conservative right complains about when environmentalists use them to protect the environment.In Koch's latest failed effort to use environmental law to block the project, the federal appeals court in Washington rejected his attempts to sue the FAA, which concluded the project would not interfere with airport radar. The case relied in part on using NEPA, the nation's major environmental review law, to try to overturn the federal approval.There is a connection here between the loss of American jobs and the conservatives' use of environmental litigation to serve clearly private, not public, interests.If the Cape Wind offshore wind project had not been held up for a decade by fruitless litigation, more companies like Mass Tank would have had a chance to gain competence, reduce costs, and compete against their European counterparts for Cape Wind and other offshore wind projects. There might be an emerging offshore wind industry with competitive U.S. suppliers winning bids rather than losing them.The endless litigation is not the only reason for that shortcoming, but it has to take some of the blame.So the next time someone on the right falsely decries environmentalists for killing American jobs through lawsuits, ask them to explain why their friends in Massachusetts are doing the same thing."}, {"title": "Saving Emperor Penguins Requires Swift Climate Action", "text": "They are Antarctica's answer to Hollywood -- appealing little movie stars at the center of one of the most critically acclaimed, financially successful nature films ever made.Audiences around the world were captivated by March of the Penguins, a 2005 film that grippingly depicted the almost unfathomable hardships the emperor penguin endures to nurture each new generation. In darkness and extreme cold, the males protect their mates' eggs as they fast for months through the world's harshest winter weather.But despite March of the Penguins' immense popularity, emperor penguins themselves are in deep trouble. The penguin colony featured in the film has declined by more than 50 percent. The Dion Island colony in the Antarctic Peninsula has disappeared completely. And one recent study projected that nearly half of the world's emperor penguins may disappear by mid-century.The main culprit: Climate change. Emperor penguins live in one of the most isolated places on earth. But neither that isolation nor their legendary powers of endurance can protect these icons of wild Antarctica from the deadly consequences of our planet's rising temperatures and changing oceans.That's why I was pleased by a recent announcement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- in response to a petition filed by my organization -- that the emperor penguin may warrant Endangered Species Act protection based on threats from climate change. Federal officials have agreed to conduct a full scientific review to determine if the emperor penguin should be protected under the act.That protection is badly needed. Emperor penguins rely on sea ice for raising their chicks and foraging -- and our carbon pollution is melting this sea-ice habitat in many regions of Antarctica. In areas where sea ice is rapidly disappearing, some emperor penguin populations are declining or have been lost entirely.One recent study found that penguins at four colonies were forced to climb up steep ice shelves to find nesting sites in years when sea ice was not available.Warming ocean temperatures and melting sea ice in the Southern Ocean encircling Antarctica have also diminished the availability of krill -- a key food source for emperor penguins. Krill has declined by as much 80 percent since the 1970s over large areas of the Southern Ocean. Ocean acidification resulting from the ocean's absorption of carbon dioxide and growing industrial krill fisheries further threaten the penguins' food supply.The bottom line: Emperor penguins need legal protections and rapid cuts in carbon pollution if they're going to have a future.The Endangered Species Act could be a lifeline for these imperiled birds. Over the past 40 years, the act has rescued more than a thousand species from extinction. A listing would give the emperor penguin greater protections against the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change and the industrial overfishing of key prey species.For example, if penguins are listed, future approval of fishing permits for U.S.-flagged vessels operating on the high seas would require minimization of impacts on penguins.The act also requires federal agencies to ensure that their actions -- including those generating large volumes of carbon pollution -- do not jeopardize endangered species and their habitat.But the penguins' plight also raises a larger issue. Emperor penguins, after all, are hardly alone in facing an existential threat from climate change. From polar bears to wolverines, species who make their homes in ice and snow are at risk, of course. And across the board, it's increasingly clear that climate change will take a catastrophic bite out of the world's biodiversity.Scientists predict that by 2100 more than one in 10 species may be on the verge of extinction due to climate change. More than half the habitats of most plants and about one-third of animals will become climatically unsuitable by 2080 unless we curb carbon pollution, according to another recent study.Here at home, an analysis by my organization found that hundreds of America's endangered species will be threatened by the sea-level rise alone - just one of climate change's many nasty side effects.The Endangered Species Act can help us buy time for many of these animals. But we have to use that breathing space wisely. Unless we act quickly to cut greenhouse gas pollution, our world will lose many of the amazing animals and plants that make this green planet a lovely place to call home."}, {"title": "A Big Break for Polar Bears, the Arctic", "text": "Polar bears and other wildlife in the Arctic just got a crucial break.On Wednesday, an appeals court said the federal Interior department wrongly sold leases to drill for oil and gas in the Chukchi Sea off the north coast of Alaska.The decision confirms what so many of us have known all along: we have no business approving offshore drilling in the Arctic -- a high-risk environment where an oil spill would be impossible to clean up and put wildlife directly in harm's way.The lease sale, approved by the Bush administration in 2008, offered nearly 30 million acres in the Chukchi Sea for oil drilling -- an area larger than Pennsylvania. Alaska native groups and conservationists challenged the sale in court which led to this week's decision.Simply put, the Chukchi Sea is no place for drilling ships. It's where polar bears hunt for ringed seals, where walruses socialize and bowhead whales make their way to rich feeding grounds. Hardly the place for a polluting and dangerous industrial work site.This week's ruling, from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, is the second time a court has found that the government, in approving these leases, ignored basic legal protections designed to safeguard this incredible landscape and all its inhabitants.Unfortunately the Obama administration, following in the steps of the Bush administration, has been slow to get the message. Federal agencies seem perfectly willing to open the Arctic landscape to drilling despite the monumental risks to people and wildlife.Many of these wildlife species -- including polar bears -- are already at serious risk from global warming, which is melting away the ice they need to survive. The last thing they need is an oil spill to contend with.We're happy with this week's ruling, of course, especially that it could help the Arctic's wildlife. But we shouldn't have to go to court every time the Arctic Ocean comes under assault. It's time for the Obama administration to rethink Arctic drilling and take this dangerous activity off the table for good.Photo: Kathy Crane, NOAA Arctic Research Program"}, {"title": "California Drought Photos Show What Happens When It Rains Just 4 Inches In 13 Months", "text": "California has seen its share of droughts, but -- at least in recent years -- it hasn't seen something like this.Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency last week, shorty after it was revealed that 2013 was the state's driest year in recorded history. San Francisco saw a low record-shattering 5.59 inches of rain (compared to the previous low record of 9 inches), while dry Los Angeles saw just 3.6 inches of precipitation in all of 2013.To make matters worse, there isn't a drop of rain in sight. At the time of publication on January 24 -- when snow and freezing temperatures battered the rest of the country -- the forecast was a sunny 77 degrees in Los Angeles.While those bundled and shivering on the East Coast might have little sympathy for the Golden State's January beach weather, take a look at what the drought has done to the water supply across the state:A bathtub ring around the San Gabriel Reservoir in the Angeles National Forest reveals the low water level.Girls walk on rocks that normally make up the water's edge at Folsom Lake.Forestry experts feared the drought would prime the Sierra Nevada mountain range for a major fire -- a prediction that sadly came to fruition during the devastating Rim Fire that burned through hundreds of acres of Yosemite National Park.This month's Colby Fire, which destroyed several Southern California homes, was also worsened by the drought.Signs opposing California lawmakers -- seen by some as responsible for worsening drought conditions with legislation -- are common in the inland Central Valley and display the increasing tension over water rights in the state.A fish washed ashore on the banks of Folsom Lake.California Governor Jerry Brown compares satellite photos of the Sierra Nevada snow pack from 2013 and 2014 at a press conference to declare the state in a drought emergency.Researchers at the Department of Water Resources look over a meadow that is usually covered in snow during the final survey of the 2012/2013 season in May.Researchers at the Department of Water Resources measure snow levels near Echo Summit in January, 2014. The readings showed the water content in the snowpack was at 20 percent of average for this time of year.The drought isn't limited to California: the low water level can be seen at Hoover Dam in Nevada, as well."}, {"title": "What a Wall Street Banker Says About Our Society", "text": "In the New York Times, a former Wall Street banker begins a deep and emotional piece on wealth addiction with the following confession:In my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million -- and I was angry because it wasn't big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.The piece is important for numerous reasons, but what strikes me particularly is how much Polk's story coincides with what we are feeling as a nation. Last week I wrote about new evidence that as societies develop, they eventually reach a point where increases in GDP no longer bring about corresponding gains in happiness.As more states across the U.S. (and more countries across the world) begin adopting alternative measures they find that while GDP has been increasing, other measures of well-being have remained flat. Our national Genuine Progress Indicator, which takes into account environmental, social and distributional (inequality) has remained stalled for decades, while GDP growth has plodded forward.Could it be that as a society, we are addicted to growth? There are numerous indications that this is the case. For one, research finds that when asked \"\"What do you think will be the most serious problem facing the world in the future if nothing is done to stop it?\" only 10 percent of American said, \"the economy,\" while 25 percent said \"the environment\" or \"global warming.\" And yet progress on climate change is constantly stalled by members of Congress warning of harm to economic growth (even though climate change will is alreadypummeling economies).Regulations are constantly denounced on the spurious claim that they will \"kill jobs,\" even though the most comprehensive studies show that they don't. We have ad campaigns based around the idea that you should ruin perfectly good phones and computers, even though e-waste imposes horrific costs on the environment and children in developing countries.As E.F. Schumacher warned, \"Call a thing immoral or ugly, soul-destroying or a degradation to man, a peril to the peace of the world or to the well-being of future generations: as long as you have not shown it to be 'uneconomic' you have not really questioned its right to exist, grow, and prosper.\" Obama has opened up new drilling, pressured by groups promising \"jobs\" and \"growth\" even while we face an inflating carbon bubble.As Oscar Wilde wrote long ago, \"In a community like ours, where property confers immense distinction, social position, honour, respect, titles, and other pleasant things of the kind, man, being naturally ambitious, makes it his aim to accumulate this property, and goes on wearily and tediously accumulating it long after he has got far more than he wants, or can use, or enjoy, or perhaps even know of.\" What he says of individuals can just as easily apply to societies."}, {"title": "The Dangers of King's Farm Bill Amendment", "text": "Most Americans may not be aware of the Farm Bill, but it has significant ramifications for many of us, affecting everything from the prices we pay for groceries to the information we see on food labels. And the version of this legislation passed by the House of Representatives could have even broader implications. The House Farm Bill contains a radical provision introduced by Rep. Steve King (R-IA) that could wipe out many state and local laws regarding the production or manufacturing of agriculture products -- the Senate bill fortunately contains no such provision. House and Senate conferees even now are in negotiations over the Farm Bill, and Congress should reject any version of the so-called King amendment in the final legislation.The disastrous King amendment could affect a wide variety of state and local laws we all depend upon to protect our health and safety, but the provision was first penned to overturn state laws protecting farm animals. In California, voters in 2008 overwhelmingly supported Proposition 2 that bans the inhumane confinement of egg-laying hens, breeding pigs and veal calves in cages so small the animals cannot stretch their limbs, lie down or turn around. California law also requires any shell eggs sold in the state to come from hens housed in compliance with Proposition 2. The Humane Society of the United States worked tirelessly to get Proposition 2 passed; it marked a major triumph for farm animals. But it was also seen as a blow by Rep. King, who represents Iowa, the top egg-producing state in the country.King's amendment is intended to target Proposition 2, to override the wishes of California voters who want to ensure their eggs come from humanely-treated hens, and to protect the inhumane factory farming practices of some Iowa egg producers. But the scope of the King amendment is much more wide-ranging than one California law. A group of law professors from schools around the country warn that the King amendment language is open to many interpretations and could undermine vital state agricultural laws, including many that protect the safety and health of members of the public.For instance, it could have an impact on Maryland's ban on arsenic in poultry feed; Vermont's ban on BPA in baby food jars and infant food containers; and laws in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and Washington requiring labeling of farm-raised fish. Dogs and puppies suffering in puppy mills could lose their protection in many states. All of these issues fall within the loose definition of \"agricultural products\" for the purposes of the King amendment.The King Amendment threatens to strip states of their right to ensure the health and welfare of their citizens. This is serious. The Tenth Amendment guarantees that the states' sovereign rights cannot be abridged by Congress. States have the authority to regulate in order to protect the health, safety and morals of citizens within their borders.We can't allow Rep. Steve King to ramrod through legislation that protects factory farming interests at the expense of animal welfare and public health. Nor can we allow him to sacrifice states' rights in favor of corporate profits. The King Amendment is dangerous on many fronts and needs to be stricken from the Farm Bill."}, {"title": "'Coal Train Blues' Needs To Win A Grammy ASAP (VIDEO)", "text": "Well, replacing the lyrics from a famous song with coal-related facts is one heck of a way to spread environmental awareness, especially if it's to the heel-tapping, feel-good hit, \"Folsom Prison Blues.\"Portland-based Johnny Cash tribute band, Counterfeit Cash, has so cleverly performed \"Coal Train Blues\" that it's bound to get stuck in your head and spread as fast as -- eh, coal dust.Though catchy, Counterfeit Cash's new hit is no heel-tapping, feel-good song after all.

Previously, grainy camera-trap images were the main evidence of the cat's existence.The bay cat, or Pardofelis badia, is a mysterious little wildcat that lives only on the island of Borneo, which includes the countries of Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. The diminutive hunters are smaller than the average house cat and have either ruddy chestnut or grayish coats. Their nocturnal nature and secretive demeanors, combined with a low population density, make sightings of the cats incredibly rare. Almost nothing is known about what they eat or how they reproduce. [Video: Cameras Spot Rare Bay Cats in Borneo]Logging has threatened some of these cats' tropical forest habitats, and the creature is now listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the past, the elusive cats were only documented in poor-resolution camera-trap images first captured in 1998. In November 2013, another research team captured several camera-trap images of the cats, along with Sunda clouded leopards and marbled cats.To find out more about the species, photographer Sebastian Kennerknecht and Andrew Hearn, a researcher at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, went out into the rainforests of Borneo on the hunt for the bay cat. The team took two trips but managed to get just one photo of the cat.\"During the first trip, we were able to get pictures of a marbled cat and Sunda clouded leopards, but the bay cat proved elusive,\" Kennerknecht said in an email. \"Only on the second trip did we get this single picture. It is of a grey phased male that Andrew has gotten on camera before.\" [See Images of the Borneo Bay Cat]To find the cat, the team chose spots to place customized digital SLR camera traps where Hearn had sighted bay cats before, Kennerknecht said. The cameras shoot when an animal crosses an infrared sensor.The image was captured in the unlogged lowland rainforests of Malaysian Borneo.Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

And I think Freedom Industries, the corporation responsible, did a great public service when it answered the age-old question: \"What's the worst that could happen?\""}, {"title": "Why the Cost of Carbon Pollution Is Both Too High and Too Low", "text": "From EDF Voices:Tell someone you are a \"climate economist,\" and the first thing you hear after the slightly puzzled looks subside is, \"How much?\" Show me the money: \"How much is climate change really costing us?\"Here it is: at least $40.That, of course, isn't the total cost, which is in the trillions of dollars. $40 is the cost per ton of carbon dioxide pollution emitted today, and represents the financial impacts of everything climate change wreaks: higher medical bills, lost productivity at work, rising seas, and more. Every American, all 300 million of us, emit around twenty of these $40-tons per year.The number comes from none other than the U.S. government in an effort to uncover the true cost of carbon pollution. This exercise was first conducted in 2010. It involved a dozen government agencies and departments, several dozen experts, and a fifty-page, densely crafted \"technical support document,\" replete with some seventy, peer-reviewed references and an even more technical appendix.Cass Sunstein, the Harvard legal scholar of Nudge fame, who was co-leading the process for the White House at the time, recently declared himself positively surprised how the usual interest-group politics were all-but absent from the discussions throughout that process. This is how science should be done to help guide public policy.The cost of carbon pollution is too lowThe number originally reached in 2010 wasn't $40. It was a bit more than half as much. What happened? In short, the scientific understanding of the impacts of rising seas had advanced by so much, and the peer-reviewed, economic models had finally caught up to the scientific understanding circa 2007, that a routine update of the cost of carbon number resulted in the rather dramatic increase to near $40 per ton. (There are twenty pages of additional scientific prose, if you want to know the details.)In other words, we had been seriously underestimating the cost of climate change all along. That's the exact opposite of what you hear from those who want to ignore the problem, and the $40 itself is still woefully conservative. Some large companies, including the likes of Exxon, are voluntarily using a higher price internally for their capital investment decisions.And everything we know about the science points to the fact that the $40 figure has nowhere to go but up. The more we know, the higher the costs. And even what we don't knowpushes the costs higher still.Howard Shelanski, Sunstein's successor as the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA, pronounced \"oh-eye-ruh\"), has since presided over a further update of the official number. In fact, this one didn't incorporate any of the latest science. It was simply a minor technical correction of the prior update, resulting in a $1 revision downward. (The precise number is now $37, though I still say $40 at cocktail parties, to avoid a false sense of precision. Yes, that's what a climate economist talks about at cocktail parties.)And once again, it all demonstrated just how science ought to be done: Sometimes it advances because newer and better, peer-reviewed publications become available. Sometimes it advances because someone discovers and fixes a small mathematical error.Your input is neededWhile announcing the correction, Shelanski added another layer of transparency and an opportunity for further refinements of the numbers: a formal call for public comments on the way the cost of carbon figure is calculated, open through Feb. 26.We are taking this opportunity seriously. EDF, together with our partners at the Natural Resource Defense Council, New York University School of Law's Institute for Policy Integrity, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, is submitting formal, technical comments in support of the administration's use of the cost of carbon pollution number as well as recommending further revisions to reflect the latest science.The bottom line, as economists like to put it, is that carbon pollution costs society a lot of money. So as the technical experts trade scientific papers, you can help by reminding our leaders in Washington that we need strong, science-based climate policies."}, {"title": "World Bank: \"Governments Must Put a Price on Pollution\"", "text": "The head of the World Bank has called on global leaders to throw down the gauntlet to climate change: \"This is the year to take action. There are no excuses,\" said Jim Yong Kim from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday.His clarion call comes a few days after a WEF report revealed that failure to arrest, and adapt to global warming is one the greatest threats facing our planet today.The annual gathering comes one week after the United Nations called for a 70 percent cut in international carbon emissions. Last September, the global body warned that our world may warm by up to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.Such a temperature rise would deliver a death blow to most life on earth.The news comes two months after one of the most powerful storms in history struck the Philippines, killing over 5,000 people. Caused by warmer weather over the Pacific Ocean, typhoon Haiyan was over 40 kilometers wide and ratcheted speeds of up to 322 kilometers per hour.It was the third super storm to strike the archipelago last year, coming 12 months after hurricane Sandy tore across the northeastern seaboard to leave much of New York City submerged under water.Once regarded as black swans, such storms have become part of the new normal for life on a hotter planet.In the words of Naradev Sano, the Philippines top climate negotiator:\"We must stop calling events like these natural disasters. It is not natural when science already tells us that global warming will induce more intense storms. It is not natural when the human species has already profoundly changed the climate.\"Speaking before Congress last week, climate scientist Andrew Dessler described  global warming as \"a real and present danger.\"So far, our planet has warmed by around 0.8 degrees Celsius. And, according to the UN, things are about to get much hotter, up to 6 times hotter.That means that our children's children will be living in a world plagued by extreme heat waves, severe droughts and intense storms, testing the very limits of human survival. It's a brutal inheritance to hand down to our offspring.According to James Hansen, NASA's former top climate scientist, handing over such a ruined planet is a grave moral failing on par with slavery.Moreover, as carbon emissions remain trapped within the earth's atmosphere for years, even if we stopped all greenhouse gases tomorrow, our world is still destined for several decades of warming.That's why the UN is calling for such a steep cut in CO2 output. As the world population veers towards the 9 billion mark, our global carbon footprint is expected to double, if not triple by 2050.In order to meet our ever increasing energy needs, the UN says that investment in green technology needs to quadruple to 1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years.That's half the  money that global governments inject into the fossil fuel sector every year. If those subsidies were slashed and plowed into the green energy sector instead, we will have funded the start of our next energy revolution.In the words  of Jim Yong Kim: \"This challenges the notion that responding to climate change is not affordable. Governments must put a price on pollution.\"The alternative: tinkering around with something highly experimental called geoengineering.This includes brightening the clouds so that they reflect more sunlight, building machines that suck up greenhouse gases, and filling the stratosphere with sulphate particles to block out the sun.Perhaps, it's the last measure which has attracted the most controversy. Although it may have the ability to substantially cool the planet, its effects will be uneven, ushering in severe drought  across much of the tropics. Not only will this affect billions of people, it will kill off the rainforests, the very lungs of our planet.Such changes would raise the specter of war as some nations benefit from the new technology whilst others clearly suffer.\"The idea that we can put a different form of pollution into the atmosphere to cancel out the effects of global warming pollution is utterly insane,\" says  Al Gore, former U.S. Vice President.That means we need to tackle the problem head on. Earlier this week, Europe lead the charge as it laid down the world's most ambitious carbon targets to date. It says that it will slash  emissions by 40 percent, and get nearly a third of its power from renewable sources by 2030.And, although green groups have criticized the EU for not going far enough, it is currently out in pole position. It's time for other nations to follow suit. And, while disputes over who should bear the brunt of cuts will continue, each and every nation must step up to the plate. This is a global problem which requires a global solution.And, while it all may seem rather daunting, in the highly fractured world that we live in today, our greatest problem has the power to unite us. In the words  of David King, the UK's former top scientist: \"We can do this. To defeat the axis powers, the allies developed the atom bomb. When threatened in the Cold War, the U.S. sent a man to the moon. When threatened by global warming, we surely need a similar effort to save the planet.\"Something that engages our best minds, something that is international.As Winston Churchill once said: \"The empires of the future lie in the empires of our mind.\" It's time for us to strive towards that future, for as writer and activist Paul Gilding points out: \"Like generations before us, we'll be growing up in war. Not a war between civilizations, but a war for civilization. It will take every mother, every father, and every child. But, this could be our finest hour.\""}, {"title": "Restoring the Pacific Through International Trade Laws", "text": "The Pacific Ocean is one of the world's greatest resources. Occupying one-third of our planet's surface and more area than all of the land combined, it harbors a wealth of food and energy that many nations rely on for economic security, including our home nations of Canada and Chile. But this valuable resource is in dire need of protection.  Twelve Pacific countries are currently negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement that will govern and guide international trade. Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam each have a seat at the table for one obvious reason -- they border, and rely upon, the Pacific Ocean. The TPP negotiations are an unprecedented opportunity for these nations to safeguard ocean resources -- and we need them to take action now.  The Pacific is a communal resource, but all is not well in the ocean. TPP countries make up more than a third of the global catch of seafood, but their oceans are seriously overfished. We can take a huge step towards addressing this issue with one step -- ending harmful fisheries subsidies.  Fisheries subsidies are a key driver of overfishing in the Pacific. Government funding allows massive fishing fleets to search the farthest reaches of the Pacific for more and more fish. Overfishing subsidies add up to an estimated $16 billion annually, according to a 2010 study in Bioeconomics. Flush with government cash, the Pacific (and global) fishing fleet is far larger than what we actually need to fish sustainably.  Taking too many fish from the sea threatens our ability to feed future generations. The world's population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, and we will need to produce 70 percent more food to feed the world, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Seafood will be critical to meeting this demand, so it's essential that we defend this resource now. If we fish sustainably, we could have enough seafood to feed more than a billion people a healthy seafood meal each day.  Fisheries subsidies are not the only issue that the TPP should address. Unchecked deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade are set to devastate the unique, land-based ecosystem in many Pacific countries. Scientists estimate that humans are driving current rates of extinction far higher than normal. We're losing biodiversity, and we're losing it fast. The TPP must also include bans on trade in products and timber that are harvested or exported in ways that violate national law.  Recently, Oceana joined 24 prominent conservation organizations to urge U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to push for fisheries reform and other critical conservation issues during TPP negotiations. But the oceans are a communal resource, and we need other participating nations to join us in our efforts to safeguard our ocean resources. The TPP negotiations offer a rare chance to address fisheries subsidies, and we hope that other countries, including our own, will join efforts to protect the oceans."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Obama Doesn't Need Congress to Move Forward on Clean Energy", "text": "A week before President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, a new report says Obama could advance key measures of his Climate Action Plan with or without the cooperation of Congress.\"When they believed a national situation warranted action, some past presidents interpreted their authority broadly and exercised it aggressively,\" the report said. \"That is the practice of presidential authority Americans and the world need today.\"More than 200 recommendations for how Obama can use his executive authority to accelerate progress on climate change are contained in the 207-page Powering Forward report released by the Center for the New Energy Economy and developed with the help of CEOs, energy experts, academicians and thought leaders. The recommendations focus on clean energy solutions such as doubling energy efficiency, financing renewable energy, producing natural gas more responsibly, developing alternative fuels and vehicles and helping utilities adapt to a changing energy landscape.Most of the recommendations aren't all that new, but a few, says Oilprice.com, are interesting. One suggestion is to modify mortgage rules so that qualifying for federally backed mortgage loans requires new homes to be constructed with updated energy efficiency standards.Despite the report's ideas for the future, 2013 saw many clean energy developments. The Rocky Mountain Institute calls out 10--including growth in the electric vehicle sector and companies putting a price on carbon--that helped bring the country closer to a secure, prosperous energy future.NASA, NOAA Label 2013 One of the Planet's Warmest YearsA pair of reports simultaneously released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reached different conclusions about where 2013 ranks among the world's hottest years.NOAA said last year's average world temperature of 58.12 degrees tied with that of 2003 for the fourth hottest year since 1880--when record keeping began. NASA ranked 2013 the seventh warmest on record--tying 2009 and 2006. The slight difference in rankings, scientists said, could be explained by the methods used by the agencies to interpret the same weather data collected from more than 1,000 metrological stations across the globe. NASA, for example, uses more samples from Antarctica.Regardless of the difference in rankings, both agencies found that nine of the 10 warmest years on record were in the 21st century. According to NASA, the level of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere peaked in 2013 at 400 parts per million--higher than any point in the last 800,000 years. The level was 285 parts per million in 1880.\"Long-term trends in surface temperature are unusual and 2013 adds to the evidence for ongoing climate change,\" said Gavin Schmidt of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \"While one year or one season can be affected by random weather events, this analysis shows the necessity for continued, long-term monitoring.\"Schmidt said 2014 is likely to be even warmer than 2013, remarkable partly because El Nino, the periodic warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, was absent in 2013.\"Through the second half of 2014 we are looking at the likelihood of an El Nino, which will help warm 2014 over 2013,\" he said.Southern Leg of Keystone Begins Exporting OilTransCanada began delivering oil on Wednesday from Oklahoma to customers in Nederland, Texas, through the southern portion of a controversial proposed cross-border pipeline. The start of commercial operations for this leg of the Keystone XL pipeline came with little fanfare after approval by the president nearly two years ago. Although landowners in East Texas continue to challenge TransCanada's right to take their land for the pipeline, it's the northern leg of the pipeline, which is projected to carry oil from Canada, that's been most controversial.The northern portion of the pipeline still awaits approval by the U.S. State Department. Last week, Secretary of State John Kerry brushed aside pressure from Canada, offering that he's not yet received a critical environmental report on the long delayed project.\"My hope is that before long, that analysis will be available, and then my work begins,\" he said.TransCanada acknowledged it has plans to look at building rail terminals in Alberta and Oklahoma if the Obama administration declines to approve the pipeline's northern leg. Recent accidents involving oil-bearing trains may put more pressure on the administration to approve the pipeline.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

That's roughly 10 percent of the total capital invested in listed companies. The amount of money invested into the 200 biggest fossil fuel companies through financial markets is estimated at 5.5 trillion dollars. This should be an impressive amount of money for anyone reading this.By keeping their money in coal and oil companies, investors are betting a vast amount of wealth, including the pensions and savings of millions of people, on high future demand for dirty fuels. The investment has enabled fossil fuel companies to massively raise their spending on expanding extractable reserves, with oil and gas companies alone (state-owned ones included) spending the combined GDP of Netherlands and Belgium a year, in belief that there will be demand for ever more dirty fuel.This assumption is being challenged by recent developments, which is good news for climate but bad news for anyone who thought investing in fossil fuel industries was a safe bet. Frantic growth in coal consumption seems to be coming to an end much sooner than predicted just a few years ago, with China's aggressive clean air policies, rapidly dropping coal consumption in the U.S. and upcoming closures of many coal plants in Europe. At the same time the oil industry is also facing slowing demand growth and the financial and share performance of oil majors is disappointing for shareholders.Nevertheless, even faced with weakening demand prospects, outdated investment patterns are driving fossil fuel companies to waste trillions of dollars in developing reserves and infrastructure that will be stranded as the world moves beyond 20th century energy.A good example is coal export developments. The large recent investment in coal export capacity in all key exporter countries was based on the assumption of unlimited growth of Chinese demand. When public outrage over air pollution reached a new level in 2012-2013, the Chinese leadership moved swiftly to mandate absolute reductions in coal consumption, and banned new coal-fired power plants in key economic regions. A growing chorus of financial analysts is now projecting a peak in Chinese coal demand in the near future, which seemed unimaginable just a couple of years ago. This new reality has already reduced market capitalization of export focused coal companies. Even in China itself, investment in coal-fired power plants has now outpaced demand growth, leading to drops in capacity utilization.Another example of potentially stranded assets is found in Europe, where large utilities ignored the writing on the wall about EU moves to price carbon and boost renewable energy. Betting on old business models and the fossil-fuel generation, they built a massive 80 gigawatts of new fossil power generation capacity in the last 10 years, much of which is already generating losses and now risk becoming stranded assets.Arctic oil drilling is possibly the ultimate example of fossil companies' unfounded confidence in high future demand. Any significant production and revenue is unlikely until 2030, and in the meanwhile Arctic drilling faces high and uncertain costs, extremely demanding and risky operations, as well as the prospect of heavy regulation and liabilities when (not if) the first major blowout happens in the region. No wonder the International Energy Agency is skeptical about Arctic oil, assuming hardly any production in the next 20 years. Regardless, Shell has already burnt $5 billion of shareholders' money on their Arctic gamble.Those investing in coal and oil have perhaps felt secure seeing the global climate negotiations proceed at a disappointing pace. However, the initial carbon crunch is being delivered by increasingly market-driven renewable energy development, and by national level clean energy and energy efficiency policies -- such as renewable energy support schemes and emission regulation in Europe, or clean air policies in the U.S. and in China. Global coal demand, and possibly even oil demand, could peak even before a strong climate treaty is agreed.Investors often underestimate their exposure to fossil fuels, particularly indirect exposure through e.g. passively managed pension funds and sovereign debt of strongly fossil fuel dependent states. Assessing exposure, requiring fossil energy companies to disclose and reduce carbon risks, and reducing investments in sunset energy technologies will lead to profitable investment in a world that moves to cleaner and smarter energy systems.Improving competitiveness of renewable energy, growing opposition to destructive fossil fuel projects, concerns on water shortage and the imperative of cutting global CO emissions all point in the same direction: Governments, companies and investors should all be planning for a world with declining fossil fuel consumption -- not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because it makes economic sense.  It is the direction the world will be moving to -- faster than many yet anticipate."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Faster Heating, A Stitch in Time, and More!", "text": "Today, the Earth got a little hotter.DAILY CLIMATE CHANGE: Global Map of Unusual Temperatures, Jan 22 2014How unusual has the weather been?

Not only is the Arctic warming eight times faster than the rest of the planet, but failure to account for temperature gaps has led global datasets to underestimate the rise of temperatures worldwide. By adding in new temperature data from satellites over the rapidly-warming Arctic, scientists report that the world's climate has not slowed in warming, as it previously appeared to some, but is warming as rapidly as predicted, with the Arctic currently facing the brunt of it.By Tim Eagan via OO Climate Change in the Vortex of America's Bi-Polar Politics at Yale Climate Media Forum.

Only idiots, ignorami, and certain categories of the insane dismiss the abundant science pointing to climate change, its causes, and its ongoing and future effects.To stave off a pack of strawman-hungry wolves, let's double down on the disclaiming: Climate change is an issue that warrants substantial attention. The crux of the matter is how much to prioritize it. Priorities have to be balanced, and the current balance is way out of kilter.Environmental organizations and conservation agencies took a big gamble by putting all their beans in the top-priority pot. Yes, the perils of climate change are profound. And it's true that planning for climate change is politically feasible, finally. The level of acceptance is \"good enough for gubment work,\" in the case of state and federal agencies. The same can be said for coffee-table conservation outfits like the National Wildlife Federation. Public acceptance of climate change is high enough to \"work it.\" Budgets can be built around climate change. Funding can be found and grants can be grabbed without a lot of political savvy or guts. Everybody can get credit for trying to save the world without having to deal with the harsh realities of what that really takes.Some legitimate credit belongs to those who thought prioritizing climate change might unify an environmental conservation community that has long divided its efforts among such issues as clean air, clean water, fish and wildlife conservation, and wilderness preservation. The \"envirocons,\" to loosely lump all the environmental and conservation activists and professionals, have seldom reached critical mass to make a substantial difference in domestic policy. Some think climate change will rewrite the calculus of environmental politics by providing a unified front issue.So what exactly is wrong with making climate change the top priority? First, although the political correctness of climate change is good enough for gubment work -- that is, muddling around in the bureaucracy -- it's nowhere near high enough for effective law-making, and may never be. That's because climate change is two degrees removed from the known reality of too many Americans. It's not like the simple problem of overhunting during the early 20th century, when the passenger pigeon went extinct. Everybody saw it, either directly or in the papers. Laws were passed and the problem was solved, at least for the remaining species.The next major conservation problem of the 20th century was habitat loss. Again it was easy to see: The bulldozers came and the wetlands were drained, forests were cleared, prairies were plowed, etc. The ducks and geese, most noticeably, disappeared from vast areas. Hunters (a much more prominent segment of society at the time), birdwatchers, and nature lovers in general got mad and lots of others were concerned. Laws were passed to keep the bulldozers out of the wetlands. The problem was solved, at least for the remaining wetlands, and to the extent the laws were upheld.Climate change is different, and how. You might see its effects and sense it happening, but you don't see climate change itself. And no matter how much you think you know about climate change, it requires dealing with a lot of uncertainty. You may have seen a hurricane, but was it caused by climate change? Maybe? To what degree? Prove it.Even for those who can drink uncertainty with a fire hose, climate change requires connecting some challenging dots. It's at least a two-step dance with an unwelcome partner. Step one is acknowledging that the climate is changing, and changing more rapidly than it normally might, whatever \"normally\" should mean. Just enough folks have taken this first step to put climate change on the political map.But then comes step two, the connection of this abnormal pace of climate change to human economic activity. Now you're messin' with some minds. For starters, there are those who simply have a difficult time understanding the concepts, and don't feel like making the effort to begin with. While the greenhouse gas effect is simple enough, and greenhouse gases readily identified, the combinations and permutations of causes and effects are complicated enough to lose readers by the score. Not everyone finds this stuff interesting, either. Americans love NASCAR and the Super Bowl, and find their news-hour attention riveted to mass shootings at home, terrorist activities overseas, and the latest scandal wherever. Who's got time to read about emissions scenarios and climate modeling?Then you've got the \"religious wrong\" preaching from evangelical pulpits that puny little man -- proverbial dust in the wind -- could never have an effect on God's own climate. (Why only those godless liberals could offend God with such hubris!) We're not talking about a handful of kooks here; the collective anti-science, anti-sustainability, holier-than-thou congregation is big enough to keep mean-spirited know-it-alls like Rush Limbaugh in business.Then you have the millions who've been brainwashed into thinking that there is no conflict between growing the economy and protecting the environment. They're a slightly more \"sophisticated\" crowd and more left-leaning than right. They haven't been snowed by some pass-the-plate preacher at the big-box church, but by secular Big Money itself. Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and their parades of politicians have been selling the public a bill of goods for decades. Starting no later than with Ronald Reagan, economic growth was supposed to be unlimited, and if we really wanted to protect the environment, or the climate, all we needed to do was grow the economy. That way we'd have enough money to throw at the problem.This cultural landscape of very odd bedfellows is like a minefield separating climate change talk from action. (And then, if we make it through the minefield, what action do we take?)And what about all the regular old environmental issues we felt were so urgent before we prioritized climate change? Like clean air and water, wildlife conservation, wilderness preservation, soil conservation, invasive species, Superfund, the ozone layer, green space, threatened and endangered species, environmental quality and ecological integrity at large? We were already scrambling for scraps of funding for these issues, and now the collective scraps have been taken away to feed all the climate change research, modeling, planning, and a heavy load of education and outreach.So then what should we prioritize to unify the envirocons and save the world? It should be fairly obvious. The natural progression from market hunting to habitat loss was also a progression from a microeconomic issue to a meta-economic issue. The next stage in this progression is to the macroeconomic issue of economic growth. As the bumper sticker says, \"Growing the economy is shrinking the planet.\"This isn't the blog post to go into detail on the fundamental conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. Numerous authors have described that conflict in impeccable detail. Probably one paragraph is in order, though...Economic growth means a lot more than all the good things we hear about it in the news. It's not a gravy train or a silver bullet. To put it in dispassionate terms, economic growth means increasing production and consumption of goods and services in the aggregate. Economic growth means a growing population and/or growing per capita consumption (aka \"affluence\"). It means growing GDP. It means environmental impact. It's the underlying, overarching, all-encompassing cause behind virtually every environmental problem you can think of, including climate change in a fossil-fueled economy. Meanwhile society falls asleep to the tune of \"green-growth\" lullabies. The notion of replacing those powerful hydrocarbons with \"clean\" fuels to support ever-growing GDP is a dream, all right. It's the kind of dream that turns into a nightmare as the realization hits that pulling out all the stops for economic growth is a handcart to hell.With one paragraph on the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection, the common sense should be engaged. Common sense can probably give you an inkling of the corruption of economics, too, and why economists on Wall Street and in the Fed tell you only about the benefits of economic growth without mentioning the costs, despite the fact that the costs are now exceeding the benefits for most Americans -- and for virtually all their grandkids.With the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection left to your common sense or further reading elsewhere, what's left of this post should focus our attention on the properties of economic growth as a viable issue for government agencies as well as for NGO priorities and eventually public policy. At least five key properties separate economic growth from climate change.First, just like market hunting and habitat loss -- and unlike climate change -- economic growth is readily observable. Look around you, and wherever you see an environmental problem, note the cause. It's not a mystery. It's \"human activity,\" as some like to say, but even that is an inadequate phrase, lacking policy implications. Humans and their activities should not be made to sound like a blight on the planet. It's not spiritual activity, or family activity, or civic activity that threatens our water supplies, endangers other species, and changes our climate. To be precise, it's human economic activity: the energy sector, agriculture, natural resource extraction, manufacturing, services. All the sectors -- every single one of them in an integrated economy -- plus all the infrastructure (roads, power lines, dams, etc.), plus the byproducts (pollutants including greenhouse gasses) and incidental effects including climate change.Second, economic growth can serve as an even better unifying front issue than climate change. Climate change doesn't cause all other environmental problems or the vast majority of conservation challenges. Economic growth does. All those issues faced by envirocons prior to climate change were being caused by an increasing population and its economic activities. Now we can add climate change to that list of the effects of a constantly growing human economy. Fix the growth problem, and you go a long way toward fixing the climate change problem. Mountain-top removal and Keystone pipelines wouldn't be so tempting if we weren't hell-bent on GDP growth.Third, economic growth is already entrenched in the American lexicon. The phrase itself elicits no immediate backlash from the pulpit, Wall Street, or conservative radio shows and politicians. Economic growth is expected to be in the news every day. It's a welcome topic. Now when the dialog starts, with the rest of the story about the problems caused by economic growth, debate will begin of course. But that's exactly what we need. At least economic growth is not a non-starter, as climate change is in many circles.Fourth, when it comes to really doing something, economic growth can be dealt with immediately at a fully developed policy table. It's not like climate change, where plenty of well-intentioned effort has manufactured almost no policy machinery. No new conventions or treaties are needed for real effects on the rate of economic growth. At the economic policy table, fiscal, monetary, and trade policy is already being crafted, but always in pursuit of growth. This policy table is set and waiting for chairs to be occupied by experts better-informed than the usual line-up of Chicago School economists.The need for well-rounded expertise at the economic policy table points to an immediate role for environmental bureaucrats and political appointees at the highest levels. For every economist from the Council of Economic Advisors, there should be an EPA administrator or conservation agency director explaining the costs of further growth. We need a long-overdue and ongoing discussion about the conflict between economic growth and 1) environmental protection, 2) economic sustainability, 3) national security, and 4) international stability. Then lawmakers and presidents can make informed decisions about balancing economic and other goals. Hopefully in the coming decades we'll be pursuing the establishment of a sustainable, steady state economy rather than unsustainable and increasingly destructive economic growth.Fifth, addressing the threat of economic growth is a far more practical alternative than the wishful thinking about climate change action. This is easy to understand, but only when we remember that practicality is not a concept reserved for politics. Just because the acceptance of climate change is good enough for gubment work doesn't make climate change a practical matter for spending taxpayer money or NGO dues on. Prioritizing climate change is like chopping at kudzu leaves instead of the roots. It's not going to do a significant bit of good as long as the overriding policy goal is economic growth.In short, climate change is the wrong issue for environmentalists and conservation professionals to collectively prioritize above all others. While climate change is a legitimate threat, prioritizing climate change was driven largely by (relative) political convenience and the constant jockeying for agency funding, NGO membership dues, and foundation grants. Meanwhile the failure to prioritize economic growth, the mother of 21st-century threats, is driven by shallow political thinking and the personal interests of \"leaders\" getting paid the big bucks at the heads of government agencies and environmental NGOs."}, {"title": "Kilauea Volcano Spews Lava...

How about just the fun parts and no rejection, and then you get an exceptional, well-matched new pet at the end of it?A new website -- now in its beta stage; the full launch is expected soon -- aims to bring the least frustrating aspects of looking for love online to the pet rescue market.AllPaws.com is the pet project -- ahem, sorry -- of Darrell Lerner, an entrepreneur whose previous ventures involved actual dating websites.With his background, and after surveying the most popular pet adoption websites, Lerner thought he could create a \"more forward-thinking, user-friendly\" website that would \"help a lot more pets get adopted,\" he recently told HuffPost. \"And, as part of that, if I get to pet a dog every once in a while, it's win win win.\"What makes the site more forward-thinking and user-friendly is also what makes it more like an internet dating website: Users have a whole host of preferences they can use when winnowing down potential pets, beyond the standard ones of age, gender and species.The extras include coat length and color; animal size; pets' grooming needs; if they're good with dogs, cats or kids; if they can live in an apartment; if they're vaccinated. You can choose a pet who's playful or one who likes to sit in laps (or one who is both!). You can choose pets by energy level, by the amount of training they've had, or how much shedding you can expect once they move in.There's more. AllPaws allows users to save searches, mark favorites, share animals on Facebook and Twitter and even send direct messages. (No, not to the animals themselves. C'mon. It's to the shelters and rescue groups.) Forums where pet lovers can interact are in the works.Lerner says the point of all this is to \"make the process more efficient, and generate better matches\" -- so that ultimately, people will end up with the right pets for them. Which in turn, hopefully, will lead to fewer people returning their adopted pets due to late-discovered incompatibilities.   \"We're going to be helping animals,\" he says. \"I really think we're going to do quite a bit with this site in short order.\"So far, more than 5,000 people have registered with AllPaws, Lerner tells us. He gave us some figures on how many pets have been listed so far, too: 52,183 dogs, 41,050 cats, 1,258 rabbits, 395 horses, 276 birds, 658 \"small & furry\" animals (like gerbils and Guinea pigs), 79 barn yard animals (like goats and alpacas) and 238 reptiles.Unlike actual online dating sites, however, as of late January, AllPaws has exactly zero pigs."}, {"title": "Winter Olympics Under Threat From Climate Change: Study", "text": "Russia's Sochi, Canada's Vancouver, France's Chamonix, Japan's Nagano and California's Squaw Valley all have one thing in common: These former and future Winter Olympics venues are each known as prime sites for cold-weather sports, and as breathtaking havens for sporting enthusiasts. But according to a new study, these winter wonderlands are now under threat from climate change and soon may no longer be cold enough to play host to elite winter sports competitions like the Winter Games.Researchers at Canada's University of Waterloo and Austria's Management Center Innsbruck say that if global warming continues at its current rate, only 10 of the previous 19 Winter Olympics host cities will be cold enough to reliably host the Games in the 2050s. By the end of the century, that number could drop to a dismal six. \u201cThe cultural legacy of the world\u2019s celebration of winter sport is increasingly at risk,\u201d said Professor Daniel Scott, a Canada Research Chair in Global Tourism and lead author of the study, per a media release. \u201cFewer and fewer traditional winter sports regions will be able to host a Olympic Winter Games in a warmer world.\u201dTroublingly, even if the world takes steps to reduce carbon emissions and therefore lessen the impact of global warming in the coming years, the researchers said that the number of cities that could host the games in the middle and end of the century will still fall dramatically (see the infographic below). By the 2050s, at least four Winter Games venues -- including Sochi, this year's host city -- will be too warm to host the competition, even if active steps to curb global warming are taken.(Story continues below.)  This infographic presents the researchers' predictions as to whether or not Winter Olympics host cities will be \"climatically reliable\" to host the Games in the 2050s and 2080s in both a \"high emissions\" and \"low emissions\" future. The \"high emissions\" scenario is likely, the researchers say, if global warming continues at its current rate. The \"low emissions\" future, on the other hand, can be achieved if the world takes steps to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus ensuring that global surface temperatures don't rise by more than 2 or so degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). That'd be the \"best case scenario,\" Scott said.Scott told The Huffington Post that he and his colleagues looked at several indicators to determine a location's \"climate reliability.\" Most crucially, they looked at whether or not the daily minimum temperature at a host city would remain below freezing (0 degrees Celcius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit) and whether or not the site could maintain a snowpack of at least 12 inches for alpine events (through both natural snowfall and snowmaking).If the daily minimum temperature remained above freezing at a particular location, snow and ice surfaces would not \"have a chance to recover from greater daytime melt, creating soft and slow surfaces. Additionally, at these temperatures, snowmaking is not feasible to repair snow surfaces, and any precipitation is likely to fall as rain, further degrading ice and snow surfaces with even refrigerated ice degrading,\" the study says, adding that these conditions would not be \"conducive to fair elite-level competitions.\" Moreover, Scott explained to the HuffPost, snow that is too soft \"can also be dangerous for the athletes.\"Albania's Erjon Tola reacts after finishing the first run of the men's slalom, at the Vancouver Olympics in Whistler, British Columbia, on Feb. 27, 2010. When Vancouver hosted the Winter Olympics in 2010, a snow shortage forced organizers to bring in bales of hay and extra snow to create the courses for some outdoor events. Climate change was blamed for the snow shortage at the time. Researchers say that Vancouver is one of the many former host cities which will not be cold enough by the 2050s to reliably host the Winter Games.Though the Winter Olympics was the focus of their study, the researchers insist that it's not just professional athletes who should be concerned by their findings. \"There are also implications for the participation in outdoor winter sports in general,\" Scott told the HuffPost. Not only will winter sport hotspots like Vancouver and Chamonix soon be too warm to competitively ski or snowboard in, but beloved ski spots all over the world are heating up, too.In New England, for instance, more than half of the 103 ski resorts currently operating will not be economically viable by the 2040s due to snow shortages, according to Scott. \"The remaining [locations] will be at higher elevations,\" he said. \"This means that some people will have to drive further to go skiing -- and the question is, will people be willing to do that? Will we still have skiers if they don't have local hills to practice on?\"Last year, 75 Winter Olympic medalists, including alpine skier Julia Mancuso and snowboarder Hannah Teter, wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama, urging him take action on climate change and clean energy. \"As professional athletes, representing a community of 23 million winter sports enthusiasts, we\u2019re witnessing climate change first-hand,\" the letter, part of the Protect Our Winters campaign, read. \"Last year was the warmest year on record, and once again, we\u2019re currently experiencing another winter season of inconsistent snow and questionable extremes. Without a doubt, winter is in trouble.\"To learn more about how climate change is impacting the Winter Olympics, check out the full study on the issue here."}, {"title": "Building From a Merger That Didn't Happen", "text": "The following post is jointly authored by Mark Tercek, President & CEO of The Nature Conservancy and Brett Jenks, President & CEO of Rare.  Last fall, we were pleased to announce that The Nature Conservancy and Rare planned to merge. However, after a thorough analysis by our teams, we announced earlier this year that we have decided not to merge.  The decision wasn't easy, but our rationale was clear: The fundamental premise of the merger was our belief that we could get more done for conservation. We still believe that. We concluded that we can still achieve greater results for conservation as highly aligned but independent partners.  It initially seemed to us that both organizations would benefit from a merger. Rare's experience in catalyzing behavior change around the world would complement the Conservancy's applied conservation science, on-the-ground expertise and relationships with key government and private sector leaders around the world.Together, we could scale up Rare's ground-breaking Pride campaigns, the organization's signature method of inspiring local people to adopt conservation solutions and empower them to make those solutions their own. And Rare's work with partners to restore near-shore fisheries would become a great alliance with the Conservancy's ambitious global fisheries strategy and other ocean conservation efforts.   What's more, our cultures--both centered on innovation, agility, and measurable results--are a great fit. A experienced organization like the Conservancy can no doubt learn a thing or two from a small, nimble and entrepreneurial organization like Rare. At the same time, the Conservancy's global infrastructure would likely accelerate Rare's high-growth trajectory. The Conservancy's culture of autonomous yet carefully aligned programs would ensure that Rare retained its identity, autonomy and independence.  Of course, many cautioned us that mergers are hard. They often don't work. We were fully aware of the difficult road ahead, but we believed the benefits could prove so great that we would be remiss not to explore the opportunity.  Others say we erred in announcing our intentions too early. Yet only so much can be explored in advance, and we wanted the merger evaluation process to be open and transparent. A thorough review would require the involvement of many people, so better to tell our staff, partners and donors exactly what we were intending to do.The merger evaluation process resulted in a tremendous amount of learning, not only about each other but also about our own organizations. We came to better understand what makes each of our organizations great (of course we're biased here, and there is always room for improvement). We determined that we could achieve much of the same increased mission impact through partnership, without running the inherent risk of compromising our unique ways of doing business.  The process also brought together leadership and staff from across Rare and the Conservancy. As a result, our teams have gotten to know each other better, built more trust and respect and developed new ideas for working together.While certainly this experience did not come without some cost, we feel it was worth bearing, no matter the outcome. Good things rarely come without challenge or risk, and we will be better partners now for trying. So we hope our decision not to merge will not discourage other nonprofits from considering similar opportunities. In the nonprofit space, we should continuously ask ourselves how we can better collaborate with others in pursuit of our mission.[Image: Aerial view of the Rock Islands and coral seascape at the Republic of Palau.

In my experience the answer to that is yes. First of all, it is a great place to meet people who are otherwise almost impossible to get hold of -- how often do you bump into world leaders and CEOs around a coffee table?Secondly, every session I have been to has provided me with at least one inspirational nugget. Although a word to the wise, as with real mining, these nuggets are well-hidden among mountains of waste. But finding them is absolutely worth the effort.Third, and most importantly, the WEF in fact sometimes does things which -- as a platform -- it was perhaps never intended to do. It can create something with a lasting impact. One of the best examples of this was the role the WEF played in the creation of the Consumer Goods Forum. The group of companies in the Consumer Goods Forum has agreed to do something by 2015 that it would probably take governments decades to negotiate: Namely, to source commodities like palm oil, soya, beef, paper and board in a sustainable fashion.With this year's WEF focusing in part on the climate agenda, I was set to wondering what it could usefully do beyond confirming the obvious: Climate change is a serious issue that we caused and only we can fix. I came up with three ideas, which are more complex than the seemingly simple sentences below; however, with the caliber of delegates currently in Davos, they are not beyond the realm of achievability.First, all countries could price energy according to its carbon content and use the revenue generated to lower employment taxes.Second, countries could identify a few high carbon content products such as steel, reflect the environmental cost of that content in the consumer price and use the revenue to help poor countries green their growth.Third, countries could oblige all pension funds to invest 20 percent of their capital in energy efficiency and another 20 percent in renewable (I \"borrowed\" the percentages from the EU). There is enough non-anecdotal evidence to show this can be quite profitable and pension funds do have a social purpose.The International Energy Agency could manage the first, the World Trade Organization the second, and the P8, twhich is made up of senior leaders from some of the world's largest public pension funds, the third. All three can report back at the next WEF and collect their new assignments.Big challenges need big ideas."}, {"title": "Calif. Drought Spurs Some Cities -- Not All -- To Conserve", "text": "Californians are hoping big rains will relieve the drought emergency declared in the state last week.Read more on Climate Central"}, {"title": "Yes We Care! Latinos Want Action On Climate Change", "text": "Yes we care -- that's the message Latinos in the United States delivered loud and clear in a new poll by Latino Decisions for the Natural Resources Defense Council. A majority of us Latinos in the U.S. care about fighting climate change. We care because we know it's the environmental scourge of our time. We care because it's threatening our families and our communities. And we want the country to take action now against the dangers we're already seeing from this growing threat.We've seen it before and this poll again dramatically emphasizes the point. In fact, 9 out 10 Latinos want action against climate change. That's a compelling margin of support. And this support also crosses party lines with 68 percent of Republican Latinos say that it is somewhat to extremely important for our government to tackle global warming and climate change. 87 percent of Independents agree with this view while 97 percent of democratic respondents hold this belief.On air pollution support is even greater. 92 percent of Republican Latinos think it is somewhat to extremely important for our government to tackle air pollution. The number for Independent respondents is 98 percent while 99 percent of self-identified Democratic respondents agree with this view.According to Latino Decisions, the pollsters who conducted the survey, the intensity with which Latinos support climate action and environmental protections is second only to the level of support they've seen in comparable polls for immigration reform policies. Yet political leaders have failed to talk to Latinos about carbon pollution, clear water and clean air. They continue to miss out on this valuable support by not telling us what they're doing to address these concerns. We want to know what's being done. We care.We have seen this concern reflected on environmental measures before. In November 2006, massive Latino turnout in California voted 84 percent in favor of the largest water/park bond in U.S. history carrying Proposition 84 to victory. Similarly, in 2010, exit polling indicated that areas with high percentages of Latino voters were overwhelmingly against Proposition 23, which would have killed California's landmark climate law, AB 32, and the emerging clean energy economy.Time and again the message is: start talking to Latinos.Hispanics will soon become the dominant ethnic group in the nation's most populous state, California. According to California Governor Jerry Brown's projections, Latinos are set to surpass whites as the new majority in March of this year. It'll add urgency to the need to talk and listen to us.In 2012, twelve million Hispanics voted in the presidential elections (10 percent of the U.S. electorate) and this number is expected to double to 20 percent by 2030. And we're passionate about taking action against climate change.Importantly, this poll also looked at the why behind this support and what came up most often and with most intensity in both polling and in focus groups that preceded the polling were aspirational reasons like leaving a better, cleaner, healthier world for the next generation. Specifically, 90 percent of Latinos feel at least somewhat convinced of our duty to act now to protect the well-being of the next generation so that our children and grandchildren will have safe and clean communities and a healthier planet. Concerns over the health-effects of a worsening environment are also strong motivating factors.Economic and religious considerations did not rise to the level of these other concerns. Perhaps this is because many Latinos still feel that despite their challenges, our community is still poised to fulfill our American dream.A September 2012 Fox News Latino poll found that Latinos believe the next generation of Latinos in the United States will be better off than they are today. A recent poll by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health echoes this revealing that \"when Latino parents of children under age 18 are asked about their children's futures, the majority are optimistic about the opportunities their children would have, and despite reporting problems and concerns of various kinds, most Latinos report high levels of satisfaction when asked about their lives in general.\"Many of us and our parents came to this country because it was -- and for most Latinos still is -- the land of opportunity, and as such we still believe that here anything is possible. It follows that we would be eager to support leaders who can help us achieve that dream through clean energy jobs, strong carbon limits, and healthier air. And yet, policymakers continue to miss out on this opportunity to cultivate awareness and take a stance. It's time to start talking about what's possible and mobilizing the people who believe we can do it.Starting the conversation will also require us to recognize that while traditional \"environmentalist\" messaging and imagery of the lone hiker on the pristine trail may resonate with the individualistic tendencies of some, Latinos are more likely to respond to the interconnected, global aspect of environmental concerns, as this poll shows. Enjoying the outdoors with our family, protecting the earth, water, and natural resources here and abroad for our children and family, are all elements connected to our innate sense of community.This deep personal sense of our global interconnectedness not only to our family members who join us for dinner around the table every night, but for our extended network of cousins, aunts and grandparents whether they live here in the U.S. or abroad, is reflected in this polling which shows us that protecting family here and abroad are strong motivators to act on climate. This sense of duty to the close and extended family as well as concerns that family members abroad may not be as resilient or able to cope with climate impacts -- was reflected in focus group research conducted last summer.Latinos intuitively recognize and viscerally feel the interconnectivity of the heritage that we share with our neighbors abroad. Because of this global kinship, it's only natural when Latinos think about the impacts of climate change on the future of our environment that we think about it in terms of the world. When asked if they thought about these concerns in terms of themselves, their families, community, country, entire world, or something else; the most common response was out of a concern for the \"entire world.\" Transnational ties Latinos share with family and their ancestral homeland account for this more global perspective. In fact, 63 percent were \"somewhat to very worried\" about environmental problems facing families abroad.So while we may still be a step away from seeing Latinos march in great numbers on climate, those who ignore these findings do so at their peril. Latinos are speaking up loud and clear: it's time to talk to us and show us how we plan to cut the carbon pollution that is driving climate chaos, imperiling our communities and threatening our children's future.We know our country can deliver."}, {"title": "UN General Assembly President John Ashe on Climate Change: The Need to Act Fast and Collectively", "text": "GA-President John Ashe. Picture: UN General AssemblyThe sitting president of the 68th United Nations General Assembly John Ashe, a trained bioengineer from the Caribbean islands Antigua and Barbuda, has for a long time dedicated his energy and expertise to the causes of climate change and sustainability.According to a biographical note published by the UN Department of Information:Ashe successfully led negotiations that resulted in Chapter X of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, and co-chaired the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012. In 2004, he presided over the thirteenth session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, the body responsible for reviewing programmes on the implementation of Agenda 21, the blueprint for rethinking economic growth, advancing social equity and ensuring environmental protection.

Ashe also chaired the Convention's Subsidiary Body on Implementation and, most recently, the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol.According to Ashe: \"I still have a passion for these topics. I am no longer involved in the day to day negotiations as far as climate change goes, but I still do follow the issues. The most recent event where I was involved in my capacity as President of the General Assembly was the climate conference in Warsaw.\"He set the stage for sustainability post 2015 by making this issue the last General Assembly's main theme. Early on he warned that climate change can have severe, disruptive consequences for economies across the globe, a topic that will be discussed at this week's World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.In an interview with news channel Al Jazeera, Ashe pointed out:\"In the Caribbean, one of the biggest dangers -- and it's frequently overlooked -- is the effect of a hurricane on the economy. One hurricane can set back a country's economy by decades. And if a scientist predicts that these are going to be more frequent, you can imagine the alarm bells that are ringing down there in terms of climate change.\"When you move on from the GA president's office, how do you hope to stay involved with the urgent matters of sustainability and climate change you have dedicated so much time and expertise to?I don't know what happens on September 16, 2014, but the interest in the issues will certainly not die away; I will still find some way to stay engaged.A recently leaked draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published last week by the New York Times, described the following, \"Another 15 years of failure to limit carbon emissions could make the problem virtually impossible to solve with current technologies, experts found.\" How would you comment on this statement, what should be the immediate consequences?These findings are not new. Just today Secretary General Ban Ki-moon gave a briefing to member states on his priorities for 2014 and he reminded member states that he intends to convene the climate change summit here at UN headquarters in September of this year. (A summit that will prepare member states for the climate change convention in Paris in 2015.) In my summing-up of the meeting, I reminded member states that the goal we all hope to achieve is a legally binding agreement, attained by all parties to the climate change convention in 2015, at the conference in Paris. But it should not be an agreement for the sake of having one. It should be ambitious in content with defined targets and timelines for every single party, irrespective of whether it is classified as an industrial country or a developing country.An NBC report from yesterday describes that the number of Americans who don't believe in climate change, rises. How do you explain that trend?They say leadership starts at the top. Recent developments here in the US would lead one to the sad conclusion that the interest within the current US administration seems to be waning. It was never going to be easy, but I think with the other concerns that have risen, particularly on the political front, it doesn't leave one with much hope that we will suddenly see an upwelling of interest in the climate change issue here in the US. One would hope that this would not be the case, but if one looks at the climate change induced events that have taken place outside of the US, I think it would be a sad commentary if citizens of this country did not at least take note.Once a clear environmental leader but now consumed by the looming economic crisis, the European Union is likely to set a more cautious tone for the global debate on climate with new green energy guides released this week. What would you wish from Europe in terms of climate change, reduction goals in carbon emissions, and expansion targets for renewable energies?I am not aware of this particular development, but if that is the cause of action taken by the EU than I think the message sent would be negative. We who have followed this debate for quite some time got quite used to the EU being in the forefront. I simply hope that that would continue to be the case, especially because the seminal conference will take place in Paris in 2015.Recently I heard the German scientist Ulrich von Weizsaecker speaking at the Open Working Group on SDG's about the possible need to provide a psychological crutch for the global North regarding the implementation of reduced consumption and carbon emission, if the South would signal the willingness to cooperate. Is there a bit of a global North-South, South-North blame game going on? And if yes, how could that be avoided, going forward?There have always been differences in approach regarding the climate change question between the North and South and that probably will be so for quite some time. There is a feeling that the industrialized countries were supposed to take the lead and they have not yet done so. I am sure those would argue differently. And until that happens, developing countries, where the emphasis has always been on the eradication of poverty, should not be asked to assume additional burdens. We have a global problem that requires a global solution, and for that to happen each and every country has to assume some sort of responsibility. I think time is certainly running out and until the proverbial all hands are on deck we will be forever looking back and say twenty years from now, we should have acted faster. And certainly we should have done so, collectively.How effective in your opinion has the 68th GA session been in order to present and push the agenda for sustainability efficiently within the UN system and publicly?The theme of the 68th session is the post 2015 development agenda. We are looking at the broader development question and development agenda and climate change could be a key part of it. We should keep in mind that climate change, as far as negotiations go, are handled outside of the GA as per the wish of its member states. But at some point in time, it will all go together, hopefully in 2015."}, {"title": "Obama: Climate Plan Will Help U.S. Negotiate With China, India", "text": "President Obama is under no illusion that U.S. climate policies alone can rein in global warming.

Even less reassuring, the news came out Wednesday that there was another mysterious chemical spill in that leak, and officials are now testing to make sure the water treatment facility removed that chemical.And it gets worse -- how about this article featuring a former WV coal miner Joe Stanley, who says:\"I watched the coal industry poison our water for years. Now they're telling us not to drink the water? We've been dumping this stuff into unlined ponds and into old mines for years,\" he says. \"This MCHM was just one of the chemicals we were told was highly toxic but that we dumped into old mine shafts and slurry ponds, and it's been seeping into the groundwater for years.\"Stanley says he hasn't drunk the water for years and that no one else should either.We know the coal industry is getting away with poisoning our waterways nationwide, and a new study of federal data by the Associated Press shows just that. Coal industry chemicals and waste \"have tainted hundreds of waterways and groundwater supplies, spoiling private wells, shutting down fishing and rendering streams virtually lifeless.\"And here's the damning detail: \"(B)ecause these contaminants are released gradually and in some cases not tracked or regulated, they attract much less attention than a massive spill such as the recent one in West Virginia.\"Coal-fired power plants are the nation's biggest water polluters, spewing millions of pounds of toxic metals and other pollutants like arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and selenium into surface waters each year.Beyond West Virginia, need another example of how close to home this contamination can be? Duke Energy's coal ash pollution is contaminating North Carolina's Mountain Island Lake -- a drinking water source for more than 750,000 people in the greater Charlotte area.Additionally, Duke Energy's coal ash pollution from one coal plant in North Carolina kills 900,000 fish every year in Sutton Lake -- and that's just how it affects the fish!In West Virginia, parents are wondering if they can let their kids drink the water, pregnant women are being told to drink bottled water -- and we don't even know yet the full effects of these leaked chemicals on the land and aquatic wildlife.How much longer will we let the coal industry play fast and loose with our water? From coal processing chemicals, to the toxics scrubbed while burning coal, to the coal ash left behind - the industry is poisoning an element necessary for all life: water. It's time to close these water pollution loopholes once and for all."}, {"title": "The Future Five: Animal Shelters Get Support for Lifesaving Program", "text": "Most people have probably already strayed from their resolutions to make lasting changes in their lives in 2014. But the Kanawha/Charleston Humane Association in West Virginia knows the secret to sticking to your goals: Keep them out in the open for everyone to see. Just as some people share resolutions with friends for accountability, the shelter now lists its annual, monthly and weekly adoption goals -- and how close it is to reaching them -- on a board visible to everyone who walks through the door.That's one reason why Alley Cat Allies chose Kanawha/Charleston Humane Association for our new grant program, the Future Five: Shelter Partners to Save Cats' Lives, which aims to develop five model shelters. We awarded five shelters with $5,000 each to help launch lifesaving programs to meet their goals -- significantly increasing the number of live releases for animals that enter their doors. Each shelter also receives one year of customized guidance and resources from our staff.The Future Five program supports shelters as they make high-impact changes that increase their lifesaving capacity. The selected shelters demonstrate a commitment to saving animals' lives and have already made progress by rewriting ineffective policies and making other forward-thinking changes. The shelters have all committed to a Feral Cat Protection Policy. This means they have stopped impounding and killing feral cats ,and now only accept feral cats into their program to neuter and vaccinate them, and then return them to where they were trapped -- their outdoor home.Stanislaus County Animal Services in Modesto, California recently started a Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program and encourages residents to help by humanely trapping feral cats and bringing them to the shelter to be spayed/neutered, vaccinated and ear-tipped -- the tip of the left ear is removed while the cat is anesthetized to identify the cat as neutered and vaccinated. After a short recovery period they are returned to their outdoor homes. Bay Minette City Shelter in Alabama hopes that, with the one-on-one support provided through the Future Five program, it can improve how the community views feral cats -- and animal control officers. A shelter in Franklin, Indiana, Johnson County Animal Shelter, and its partner the Humane Society of Johnson County are committed to educating their entire community about TNR, and the Future Five program will help make this happen. Lee County Domestic Animal Services in Fort Myers, Florida has been carrying out TNR for four years -- but is ready to ramp up its work and improve its save rates for adoptable cats.When shelters stop the ineffective cycle of impounding and euthanizing (i.e., killing) feral cats, and instead support TNR, they almost immediately see the benefits. By humanely ending the breeding cycle and mating behaviors, TNR allows the cats and community members to coexist, and colonies to decrease in size over time through natural attrition. Shelters have fewer animals coming through their doors, more resources to invest in innovative programs to save adoptable animals, and more community members willing to share their time and money to support the shelter.Currently, most animal shelters still impound feral cats even though they are not socialized to people and have almost no chance of making it out of a shelter alive. This policy causes shelters to be overcrowded, millions of healthy cats to be killed and valuable resources to be wasted.There's good news though. As TNR makes headway in animal control agencies and shelters nationwide, more shelters are interested in learning how to protect cats in their own communities. That's where Alley Cat Allies' Future Five program comes in.The Future Five program won't just impact the five shelter partners -- it will help shelters nationwide make similar changes to save the lives of animals. The program will fulfill the need for step-by-step models for transformation that shelters can follow even if, like the Future Five shelters, they have limited funds and face challenges. The five shelters chosen include rural and urban areas and serve large and small populations, and each represents a different shelter structure. This range will allow Alley Cat Allies to create five different models of shelter transformation.If shelters are armed with the right tools and blueprints, they can build safe communities for cats. Alley Cat Allies' Future Five program will provide shelters interested in transforming their practices with new resources to help them jump in, make change happen, and protect the lives of animals living in their communities.Becky Robinson is the President and Founder of Alley Cat Allies, the only national advocacy organization dedicated to the protection and humane treatment of cats."}, {"title": "State Dept's Keystone XL Contractor, ERM Group, Also OK'd Controversial Pebble Mine in Alaska", "text": "Cross-Posted from DeSmogBlogA DeSmogBlog investigation has revealed Environmental Resources Management Inc.

It's also a major hub for fishing and the seafood industry, leading the Center for American Progress to call the battle over Pebble Mine a \"resource war.\"\"Bristol Bay...is home to the world\u2019s largest commercial sockeye salmon fishery,\" explains a November 2013 EarthWorks blog post. \"The devastation caused by a massive open pit mine would linger in perpetuity affecting not just Bristol Bay, but the commercial fishing industry everywhere in the Pacific Northwest.\"Bristol Bay; Photo Credit: U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyLike the Pebble Mine review, ERM's review for the northern half of the U.S.-Canada border-crossing Keystone XL pipeline concluded the pipeline would have negligible environmental impacts.Another thread tying Keystone XL and Pebble Mine together: in both cases, ERM Group's environmental assessment flew in the face of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) assessment. In April 2013, the EPA critiqued ERM Group's Keystone XL environmental review, while the EPA published a damning environmental review of Pebble Mine on January 15.\"The report concludes that large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed poses risks to salmon, wildlife, and Native American cultures,\" explains an EPA fact sheet published summarizing the study. \"Bristol Bay supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world, producing nearly 50 percent of the world's wild sockeye with runs averaging 37.5 million fish each year.\"ERM scolded the EPA for not taking a balanced approach on Pebble Mine, not looking into the \"positive effects\" it would create if it opens for business.\"[EPA did not take] into account the positive effects of cash income from employment on a community's overall subsistence-gathering capabilities, as well as, harvest-sharing capabilities,\" wrote ERM. \"Overall, the Assessment lacks discussion of potential positive effects associated with industrial development.\"U.S. Sen. Mark Begich (D-AK) didn't toe the ERM party line, though.\"Wrong mine, wrong place, too big,\" Begich said in a January 19 interview with the Anchorage Daily News. \"Too many potential long-term impacts to a fishery that is pretty critical to that area but also to Alaska, to world markets. I think it will harm the environment, harm the salmon, harm the jobs that are connected to the fisheries industry out there.\"As documented previously here on DeSmogBlog, ERM has also green-lighted other projects with ecologically unsavory track records. These have ranged from an explosive pipeline project in the Caspian Sea to a contentious LNG project in Peru to a toxic tar sands refinery in Delaware.All of these projects were met with backlash from environmentalists, but eventually received the customary ERM rubber stamp.Some members of the U.S. House of Representatives have called ERM's Keystone XL northern half environmental review into question, though.Led by U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), 24 House Democrats sent a letter to President Obama on December 12 saying he shouldn't green light the northern half of the pipeline until the State Department's Office of Inspector General finishes its probe into how ERM Group was chosen and why. It's what Friends of the Earth has called a \"a polluted process.\"\"The Department of State apparently overlooked these conflicts when it accepted Environmental Resources Management's (ERM) bid to perform the analysis,\" reads the letter. \"Because of the seriousness of the conflicts...we believe no EIS from the company - draft or final - should be accepted by the administration before these issues are resolved.\"One thing is clear as Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama head into decision-making time on Keystone XL's northern half: ERM has always been able to turn a blind eye to serious environmental impacts.

These Adorable Animals Can Show You Some Great Ways To Stay Warm.", "text": "Is it Polar Vortex: Part II, or is Mother Nature just smiting you for breaking your New Year's resolution? Whether the frosty days ahead were brought about by climate change, or your failed attempt to go Paleo, we're not going to let you shiver in cold, bitter resentment. Instead, we're going to cope the best way we know how -- by taking some cues from some adorable animals. Get your warm-up on with these tips:Huddle with friends.If you think these Emperor Penguins are just huddling to look cute, you obviously haven't seen their coordinated action:This borderline-militant body heat exchange helps penguins keep warm in the bitter Antarctic winter (temperatures can dip to -76\u00b0F, think of that next time you complain.) As many as 6,000 emperor penguins can join in one huddle.Penguins also walk together in waves for maximum warmth and insulation.Up your snow shoe game.The Canadian Lynx has the snowshoe situation on lock. Not your ordinary wildcat, this bobbed-tail critter has enormous, furry paws perfectly suited to the very snowiest of terrain. The kids still complain from time to time, though:Stay under the covers all day (or winter).Need to catch up on sleep? Make like the Hazel Dormouse and snooze right through those winter blues. After pigging out on nuts all autumn, the dormouse snuggles up in a nice warm nest when the temperature dips.Black bears employ the same technique:Sometimes they get hungry early, though, and wake up for a snack!Hey, we all get mid-winter cravings, don't judge!Grow out your hair out.The Red Fox gets ready to pull those slick winter hunting moves by growing out his red-orange coat of fur until it's thick and plush. Then, he pounces:Come summer, he'll shed the excess layering, while simultaneously growing out a lighter, summer coat underneath. The process gives foxes a \"mangey\" appearance, much like us human folk when we neglect a winter haircut or a winter shave. Hold onto the scraggly 'do for now -- you can look cute for your crush come Spring!Go somewhere warm.Don't we all wish we could pack our bags and head to Mexico or Southern California for winter, like the Monarch Butterfly? Every year, tens of millions of Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus) head out on a roughly 3,000 mile aerial trip. We don't envy their perilous flight as they race against the clock, and the eminent winter chill. But once they make it, it's party time:Just hangin' out.Keep your eyes, ears... or your, er, tusk alert.The Narwhal, an Arctic whale nicknamed the \"Unicorn of the Sea,\" uses its nine-foot, sturdy yet flexible tusk as a sensory organ, according to researchers. Their tusks can calculate temperature, water pressure, motion and more. This protects them from potential predators. When it gets icy and slippery, follow the Narwhal's example, and keep your sensory perceptions in high alert mode.If we were narwhals, we'd probably spend all day having fake light-saber fights.BONUS: Flex those muscles.Though decidedly un-cuddly to most, the Burmese Python uses a method to stay warm that a snow bunny can't teach. When temperatures dip, the mother Burmese Python gets to work, wrapping herself around her nest of eggs, and rapidly flexing her muscles to generate body heat -- something we definitely could use a little more of this time of year!Winter can either make you cold and grumpy, or it can make you cuddly and fuzzy! When in doubt, make like a penguin:And waddle on triumphantly!"}, {"title": "New Species Of River Dolphin Discovered In Brazil (PHOTOS)", "text": "It seems Mother Nature still has a few secrets up her sleeve.In a study published in PLOS ONE this week, researchers announced the discovery of a new species of river dolphin in Brazil. The marine mammal is the first river dolphin to be described since 1918, the authors noted in the research.Discovered in the Araguaia River basin, Inia araguaiaensis is believed to have diverged from river dolphins in the Amazon more than 2 million years ago due to a shift in the landscape. Unlike other river dolphins in Brazil, the newly discovered species has only 24 teeth per jaw, instead of the typical 25 to 29.\"It was something that was very unexpected, it is an area where people see them all the time, they are a large mammal, the thing is nobody really looked. It is very exciting,\" lead author Dr. Tomas Hrbek of the Federal University of Amazonas said, according to BBC News.(Story continues below.)However, despite the excitement behind the new discovery, it seems the river dolphins are already under threat of extinction.\"Its future is pretty bleak,\" Hrbek told the New Scientist. \"The Araguaia-Tocantins basin suffers huge human disturbance and there are probably less than 1,000 I. araguaiaensis in existence.\"Because of the small number remaining, the team is urging the International Union for Conservation of Nature to classify the species as vulnerable.River dolphins are relatively rare. Of the four river dolphin species currently recognized, three are classified from vulnerable to critically endangered by IUCN. (There is not enough data to classify the fourth.)The World Wildlife Fund attributes the decline in dolphin populations over the last several decades to human interference in their habitats, such as dam-building and fishing nets. The Yangtze River dolphin, or baiji, is believed to have gone extinct between 2004 and 2006, making it the first dolphin humans drove to extinction, LiveScience notes."}, {"title": "Detroit's Abandoned Dog Problem Isn't As Bad As Some Thought, Survey Finds", "text": "Though abandoned pets roam the streets of Detroit, claims of 50,000 stray animals are exaggerated, according to a new study. But the city's residents need to learn to be more responsible pet owners, according to the animal welfare group that counted the city's strays.On Monday, the World Animal Awareness Society released preliminary findings from the research they started collecting in 2011. There are fewer than 3,000 loose dogs in the city on any given day, according to the animal welfare organization's report, and they believe the number will be closer to 1,000 strays when their data is further refined.That number stands in stark contrast to the figure of 50,000 stray dogs that has been suggested by Detroit Dog Rescue and others. Additionally, WAAS found fewer than 10 packs of three or more dogs that could be considered feral or wild -- that is, not allowing human interaction on the streets on a given day.The problem is still severe, according to WAAS Executive Director Tom McPhee.\"The problems that are experienced by dogs and people in the city of Detroit have not changed or diminished because the number of loose dogs is more defined,\" McPhee states in the report. \"Although there are not tens of thousands of loose dogs on the streets of Detroit, the abuse, bites, surrenders, fighting, breeding, neglect, and over-crowded shelters leading to high euthanization rates indicate substantial problems on a large scale.\"They believe that on the whole, Detroiters do not take good care of their pets, which McPhee said stems both from lack of education about pet ownership and the city's larger economic issues.\"People are literally leaving their dwellings and leaving their stuff and their animals behind,\" he said. \"I would have to say it would be considered epidemic proportions, and I think that's directly tied to people's economic situation.\"Though he sympathizes with individuals facing those situations, many local organizations that will assist pet owners or take in their pets. The problem is, he said, people don't always know that help is available.\"We've determined that the number one issue that is facing the animals, the pets in the city of Detroit, and the owners, is the fact that education needs to be key, that this community does not have, does not possess, doesn't work with, knowledge of how to be good guardians on all different levels,\" he said in a recorded press conference Monday.Last year, World Animals Awareness Society examined the issue of dog fighting in the city:The organization is addressing that lack of education, beginning with young people. They are teaming up with teachers to create lesson plans for Detroit fifth graders to learn pet guardianship skills.Numerous other groups in the city work to help pets and pet owners. One group specifically seeks to educate pet owners who keep their dogs chained up outside. Some provide food and low-cost vet care to owners who struggle to provide for their animals.Jen Clarkson, president of volunteer organization Dog Aide, earlier told The Huffington Post that she also believes education is key. More and more people have called them for help.\"It's a great step, people actually knowing assistance is out there and reaching for it ... Our mission is to assist families in the city however we can to help them hold onto their pets,\" she said. \"I'm hoping we raise awareness for the stray dogs in the city. ... They've become ghosts, kind of.\"The WAAS researchers divided the 140-square-mile city into 42 regions of similar size and assigned 50 random points within those regions. Last fall, trained volunteers were assigned 23 of the regions, where they observed and collected data at the 1,150 points that was used for the preliminary report.According to Michigan Radio, the final report will be released in September.

Here's what you do -- mix out-of-control industrial and political greed, then throw in the catalyst: a huge dose of universally-accepted misinformation. What you are left with are the makings of a catastrophic environmental disaster.One sad irony of the Kanawah Valley chemical spill disaster is that West Virginians deeply love their natural environment. The state's unique wilderness beauty is clearly prized by every son and daughter of the Mountain State. At the same time, West Virginians, like all Americans, need to be able to provide their families the food, shelter, clothing, health care, and everything else that makes life better than simply adequate. West Virginians, in short, need jobs.No one wants devastating chemical spills, toxic air quality or waterways so poisoned they can't support life. Paradoxically, too many of us are also passionate enemies of safety inspectors, quality standards, laws that protect the environment, or local agencies that help safeguard our health.Why? Because industry and politicians who protect the mightiest and most destructive money interests have convinced us that anything inconveniencing corporations or causing them to spend a dime to make their processes safe or compliant is to be opposed at all costs.Regulation of any kind, we're told constantly, costs jobs and slows the economy. Making sure federal, state and local government agencies turn a blind eye to violations is the only way to keep our economy humming.This is so untrue. For years, my colleagues in the environmental movement and I have been proving over and over again that safeguarding the environment actually goes hand in hand with providing more jobs. This isn't theory: it's proven fact.Whereas a state can destroy its natural bounty and employ people in that destruction for a while, jobs associated with these ecological assets disappear eventually. When there's not enough forest left, there are no more timbering jobs left, either. When the most valuable coal and minerals have been depleted, what's left is a jobless moonscape. And the generations who inherit this depleted environment, unattractive to both residents and tourists, will probably not be comforted by knowing that in our time, at least clever corporations made money thereby.We've proved the case over the past forty years in Oregon, where the public had formerly accepted an enormous falsehood: namely, that any restrictions on timbering would be the kiss of death to people's jobs and the state's economy. The opposite proved true. Responsible timbering and tourism have both flourished.The same applies to West Virginia right now. The public must reject the lie that regulating coal and chemical production in even the slightest way means job loss and economic hardship. Companies must be compelled, through the enforcement of laws already on the books, to clean up their acts. They'll have to spend money in the short term to comply with EPA regulations and other laws, but in the long term they'll realize even greater profits from cleaner, safer processes, and they won't have to spend money cleaning up multi-billion dollar environmental horrors. And tourists (increasingly essential to West Virginia's economy) will continue to enjoy the glories of the Mountain State's outdoors.These are some of the practical arguments in favor of curbing out-of-control industrial destruction. More compelling to me, though, is the moral argument.Is it right for only a small percentage of the human population to reap the fruits of our spectacular planet for their own financial gain? Of course not -- the idea is obscene. For centuries, brave Americans have fought to keep the forces of commercial greed from wrecking our natural environment -- now we must do the same.Forget the practical arguments. This should be enough: whether or not we say no to industries that operate with impunity all around us is a moral choice. To let our politicians continue to protect companies like Freedom Industries of the Kanawha Valley from any inspections or guidelines whatsoever is profoundly immoral."}, {"title": "Shut It You Long-haired Hippie", "text": "WATCH MY VIDEO ON YOUTUBE[Re-posted from the Eye On The Amazon]Donny Rico here to deliver a message to all you long-haired hippie activist types complaining about the environment and human rights.

But an 'all of the above' approach that places virtually no limits on whether, when, where or how fossil fuels are extracted ignores the impacts of carbon-intense fuels and is wrong for America's future. America requires an ambitious energy vision that reduces consumption of these fuels in order to meet the scale of the climate crisis.In response to this benign letter, White House special adviser John Podesta effectively told the authors to go screw themselves. With a scornful tone, Podesta lectured the leaders on the virtues of Obama's climate action plan before rudely dismissing their complaints:\"Given this context, I was surprised that you chose to send your January 16 letter to President Obama. The president has been leading the transition, to low-carbon energy sources, and understands the need to consider a balanced approach to all forms of energy development, including oil and gas production.\"In other words, don't bother us with your silly principles.If Podesta's hostility wasn't dispiriting enough for climate activists, President Obama's words in a recently released New Yorker profile were even more depressing. In response to a question by interviewer David Remnick about his second-term legacy, President Obama responded:\"I think we are fortunate at the moment that we do not face a crisis of the scale and scope that Lincoln or F.D.R. faced. So I think it's unrealistic to suggest that I can narrow my focus the way those two presidents did.\"We don't face a crisis? So Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Irene never actually happened, to say nothing of the other extreme weather events that have occurred in the last five years? You mean we didn't actually break the 400-ppm barrier?I gasped when I read that quote, in part because it played into all the right-wing stereotypes of Obama as the \"celebrity President\" who's more concerned with superficiality than seriousness. It was also a hard slap across the faces of climate activists who worked to put, and keep, Obama in the White House so that he would take aggressive action to address the ecological, economic and ethical crisis that is human-caused climate change. As Brad Johnson of HillHeat.com notes:\"Obama's presidency has been marked by a backing away from a sense of urgency about the climate crisis. 'Obviously there's great urgency in dealing with a threat to the entire planet,' Obama said as a candidate in 2007. In an October 2007 speech, he called global warming 'the planet's greatest threat,' 'the issue that will determine the very future of life on this Earth,' 'a fact that threatens our very existence,' and 'the most urgent challenge of this era.'Obama's \"We don't face a crisis\" philosophy explains, in part, his devotion to drilling and his fetish for fracking, which Bill McKibben has recently denounced in Rolling Stone and Politico Magazine. Yet I'm convinced this can't be the only reason Obama has apparently turned a cold shoulder to a warming world.Is climate change too much of a psychological challenge for the president? Is it simply too much for him to confront the near-almighty power of the fossil fuel industry and the Republican (and some Democratic) politicians who are that industry's acolytes? Is it simply a challenge that's too big for him to handle?Does he believe that he must satisfy a different constituency than climate activists -- namely, residents of both red and blue states who don't give a crap about climate, but who feel they have a divine right to \"cheap\" energy, no matter how much that energy might cost to future generations?Or does he not have a real sense of the urgency of this issue? As much as we'd like to think that only the least-sophisticated among us don't fully understand the climate crisis, could it be that Obama is an example of someone who, despite his intelligence, is almost completely tone-deaf to the screams of those suffering from the storms?I can't get into President Obama's mind, but I'm surprised that a certain concept isn't on his mind -- that of enlightened self-interest.Even the most rabid anti-Obama activist cannot deny the pure love he has for his daughters Sasha and Malia. Obama has often spoken about the importance of being a good father to his children, and he is surely proud of the job he has done as a parent.Yet you would figure that, as a father, he would be almost fixated on ensuring that his children don't grow up in a world contaminated by carbon pollution. You would figure that, in the name of protecting Sasha and Malia, he would rhetorically ravage David Koch and Rex Tillerson at every opportunity. You would figure that, seeing his legacy in the eyes of his daughters, he would stand up and declare that yes, he was indeed waging a War on Coal, since coal first declared war on our health and our future.You'd figure Obama would shake with contempt for the carbon polluters, regarding them as the sort of people who would treat his daughters as second-class citizens.Where is that contempt for the carbon class? Where is that moral indignation? To quote a man who tried, and failed, to win the White House in 1996, where is the outrage?Perhaps the outrage -- the righteous outrage -- can only be found in the hearts and minds of climate activists, who realize they must keep the heat on both major American political parties in order to bring about a new era of energy in the US and the world. After all, when it comes to climate activism, Obama himself said it best six years ago:\"Change will not come if we wait for some other person or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.\""}, {"title": "Canada's Transportation Safety Board To Recommend Sturdier Tank Cars For Crude Oil", "text": "OTTAWA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Transportation Safety Board of Canada will recommend sturdier tank cars for carrying crude oil by rail, after examining the July 6 derailment at Lac-Megantic, Quebec, that killed 47 people, the Globe and Mail said on Thursday.The oil that exploded in that disaster was carried in DOT-111 cars. Since 2011, new DOT-111 cars have been built to safer standards, but tens of thousands of older ones remain in service. The U.S. and Canadian governments are considering whether to force shippers to retrofit them or phase them out.The federal safety agency, which does not have the power to impose regulations, will be making recommendations at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) stemming from Lac-Megantic.The newspaper said the board would also recommend that railways analyze the risks associated with using specific rail routes to move flammable and combustible crude, with the possibility of selecting safer routes outside some cities.The Lac-Megantic disaster involved the more flammable Bakken oil from North Dakota."}, {"title": "Freedom Industries Failed To Disclose Second Chemical In West Virginia Spill", "text": "By Ian SimpsonThe company behind a chemical spill that left about 300,000 people in West Virginia without tap water failed to disclose a second chemical in the leak, state officials said on Wednesday.The company, Freedom Industries, had previously said that only one chemical, crude MCHM, had spilled from one of its storage tanks into the Elk River at Charleston on Jan. 9.Freedom Industries told the state Department of Environmental Protection on Tuesday that a second chemical, PPH, was in the above-ground tank despite an order immediately after the spill to disclose what was in it, the department said in a statement.Governor Earl Ray Tomblin said he was \"very disappointed\" that it took Freedom Industries, a maker of specialty chemicals, 12 days to disclose the presence of PPH.\"You know, once again it's another one of those chemicals that very few people knew anything about,\" he told a news conference.\"When I first heard about it yesterday the first thing we tried to do with my internal team is find out, what is PPH? And then why it was not revealed.\"The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that the low levels of PPH, or polyglycol ethers, and a review of information about it showed there were no new health concerns.About 300,000 people around Charleston, the state capital, were banned from using tap water for anything but flushing toilets following the spill. The ban was lifted fully on Saturday.The leak from a Freedom Industries tank was about a mile (1.6 km) upriver from West Virginia American Water, the area's main water plant and a unit of American Water Works Company Inc .Ordered by the state Department of Environmental Protection to report the contents of the tank by Wednesday afternoon, Freedom Industries said it had held only crude MCHM, or 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, and PPH.Freedom Industries President Gary Southern wrote in a letter that the mix in the tank was about 88.5 percent crude MCHM and 7.3 percent PPH, with the rest water. A copy was on the Department of Environmental Protection website.Failure to report accurately the type of materials and the quantities is a violation of state code, the department said. PPH is a thinner for MCHM, which is used in processing coal.American Water said in a statement that company and state officials were determining how to retest samples for PPH. Samples showed that crude MCHM is at extremely low levels or cannot be found, it said.Tomblin on Monday proposed legislation to regulate above-ground storage tanks. Freedom Industries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday."}, {"title": "BPA Among Toxic Chemicals Driving Up Health Care Costs, Experts Say", "text": "Health care spending in the U.S. has surged more than eightfold since the 1960s. Skyrocketing in that same time: Rates of chronic disease, use of synthetic chemicals, and evidence that many of these widely used substances may be wreaking havoc on human health.\"We know that these chemicals are reaching people. We know that chemicals can cause disease,\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of the department of preventative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\"Those diseases cost money,\" Landrigan added.New research published on Wednesday offers an example of this financial burden, widely overlooked in the health care debate. The use of bisphenol A, or BPA, in food and beverage containers, according to the study, is responsible for an estimated $3 billion a year in costs associated with childhood obesity and adult heart disease.\"One could argue that's absurdly conservative,\" said Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor in pediatrics, environmental medicine and health policy at New York University's Lagone Medical Center and author of the study.Trasande's calculations didn't take into account other health issues that studies have begun linking to BPA exposure, such as prostate and breast cancers, asthma, migraine headaches, reproductive disorders and behavioral problems. Trasande added that he was conservative in what he considered a safe level of exposure to the chemical. Scientists have warned that even minute amounts may do significant damage.Still, Trasande acknowledged, \"the science remains uncertain.\"The chemical industry continues to underscore this point. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration as recently as June  \"answers the question, 'Is BPA safe?' with one word: 'Yes,'\" Steve Hentges, of the Polycarbonate/BPA Global Group of the American Chemistry Society, told HuffPost in an emailed statement.Hentges criticized Trasande's study for disregarding \"the significant economic and public health benefits BPA delivers for a range of things from the safety and integrity of packaged foods to high performance sports equipment and auto parts.\"BPA has been banned by the FDA from children's sippy cups and baby bottles, but remains an ingredient in many products, including the lining of metal cans for food. Trasande suggested that his study raises concerns about the refusal of the FDA to ban BPA from such uses.Trasande pointed to one proposed alternative, oleoresin. Using this mixture of oil and resin to line an aluminum can would cost approximately 2.2 cents more than BPA. With 100 billion aluminum cans produced annually, that amounts to an additional $2.2 billion a year -- a hefty sum, and one that may rise with additional costs, such as premarket testing.Still, Trasande said, \"the benefits of removing BPA could potentially outweigh the costs of a potentially safe alternative.\"BPA, which about 93 percent of Americans carry in their bodies, is just one of a growing list of chemicals suspected in America's rising rates of disease. More than 80,000 chemicals are currently in commerce. A small number of those have been fully tested for health effects.Only a fraction of today's health concerns, meanwhile, were included in a 2011 study by Trasande, in which he tallied $76.6 billion in children's health care costs, lost working hours and reduced IQ points attributable to toxic chemicals and air pollutants. The $1.49 billion in childhood obesity costs that he found in his new study, for example, could be added to this total.\"Most Americans believe the government is protecting them, that chemicals are tested before they go into lipstick or food packaging. But the truth is completely the opposite: They come onto the market with little or no scrutiny,\" said Landrigan, referring to the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.Two recent moves in California illustrate just how difficult and time-consuming it can be to force something off the market, he added.In early January, a California Superior Court judge ordered three former lead paint manufacturers to pay $1.15 billion to replace or contain lead paint in millions of homes. The U.S. government banned lead paint for residential use in 1978, after nearly a century of scientific studies linked low levels of lead paint to everything from low IQ and learning disorders to sociopathic behavior. Also this month, California officially removed a decades-old requirement that flame retardants -- increasingly implicated in neurological and reproductive disorders, and cancers -- be included in the filling of upholstered furniture. (A flame retardant maker has filed suit over the new law.)Still, Landrigan said, the actions are better late than never.\"Previous efforts to control toxic chemicals have produced massive cost savings,\" Landrigan and his colleague, Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of The George Washington University School of Public Health, wrote in a paper on chemical safety and health care costs published this month.They referenced the Environmental Protection Agency's removal of lead from gasoline, which resulted in an estimated savings since 1980 of more than $3 trillion. While the heavy metal remains a menace in the U.S., mostly due to lingering lead paint, millions of children have been able to dodge lead's notorious effects on the brain, kidney and cardiovascular system.The price tags associated with chemical exposures may seem significant. Yet mostly missing in heated rhetoric about health care spending, experts say, are these and other factors driving Americans to seek costly care.\"Given current health trends, we will bankrupt the health care system within a generation due to the epidemic rates of chronic disease and escalating costs of treating them -- with or without the new health care laws,\" Gary Cohen, president of the nonprofit Health Care Without Harm, wrote in a recent blog at HuffPost.\"Prevention is far more cost-effective than treatment,\" wrote Cohen, noting that only 4 cents of every dollar spent on health care in the U.S. goes toward curbing disease.Landrigan applied a similar argument to toxic chemical regulation.\"It's more cost-effective to recognize the hazards of lead paint or flame retardants before rather than after they go on the market,\" he said.Bisphenol S, now widely used in \"BPA-free\" products, further illustrates potential problems with the government's innocent-until-proven-guilty regulatory strategy. BPS is chemically similar to BPA and, since its appearance on the market, has been documented to have the same if not more hazardous properties as its cousin compound.In other words, BPS may be sending just as many Americans to doctors, pharmacies and emergency rooms as BPA.Landrigan expressed hope Congress will pass the long-awaited update to the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Safe Chemicals Act of 2013, a bipartisan bill, is currently before Congress. Meanwhile, the advent of President Barack Obama's controversial health care reform, he said, could add urgency for addressing toxic chemicals.Among core components of the Affordable Care Act are measures to incentivize prevention.\"In the past, physicians and the health care system were paid to repair damage,\" said Landrigan. \"Going forward, they will be paid to keep people healthy.\""}, {"title": "Hawaii's Epic Swell Causes 50' Waves (PHOTOS)", "text": "A \"giant northwest swell\" has brought 40'-50' waves to the Hawaiian islands -- the biggest waves in a decades, according to meteorologists.A large storm with hurricane-force winds is moving north of the islands, causing the massive waves, which are expected to last through Friday morning.Big wave surfers were hoping the swell would merit the prestigious Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau surf competition, but event organizers decided that while the waves are big enough (the contest is only called if waves reach 20'), the winds were adverse. (Situations for \"the Eddie\" must be perfect; the competition has only happened 8 times in 28 years, most recently in 2009.)While the waves are an exciting spectacle for most, they can be dangerous and threatening to shoreline property owners. Neighborhoods on Oahu's North Shore have experienced unprecedented erosion this winter season, with whole backyards, decks, and even swimming pools getting pulled into the ocean.

CDFW biologist Jason Holley told Mother Jones that about five to 15 percent of black bears stay awake all winter. However, said Holley, the drought may be cutting down on the bears' food sources, forcing them into cities and towns, leading to an increase in sightings.Bears are finding it so unseasonably warm in the Sierra Nevada mountain range this winter that many of them are forgoing hibernation in favor of foraging through garbage, bringing them closer to humans and spelling out trouble for the food chain.Bears in the Lake Tahoe, Yosemite and beyond usually spend December through March napping in caves, but residents and visitors have noticed an increase in bear activity typical of summer months. With temperatures 10 degrees above normal accompanying the California drought, bears have found little reason to hibernate -- especially when there is plentiful food in the Lake Tahoe region.\"In this weather, you're going to see more of them,\" Chris Healy of the Nevada Department of Wildlife told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"They're totally content to hibernate, but if the food's available, they'll get up and eat.\"The troubling phenomenon has been apparent to residents of the Sierras, where last week's snowpack measured just 17 percent of normal.\"The local bears are coming out of hibernation three months early!\" Tom Loe of Sierra Drifters Guide Service wrote. \"I have been forced for the first time in nearly 20 years here to water my deciduous trees in a T-shirt -- they are budding!\"Earlier this month, a bear was caught on film scurrying across the slopes during a ski race at Heavenly Mountain Resort.

We could be looking at that in the spring.\u201d"}, {"title": "Obama, \"Green\" Energy, and Indian Tribes", "text": "Barack Obama, son of an anthropologist, might be expected to respect Indian tribes. Some of his words suggest that he does. He has issued an executive memorandum committing to \"regular and meaningful consultation\" with tribes, and supported the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which calls on governments to obtain the free, informed, prior consent of indigenous groups before taking actions that affect them.But behind the rhetoric, the Obama administration runs roughshod over tribal cultural and spiritual values.Obama's Department of the Interior is expediting industrial-scale wind and solar energy development on public lands. These \"green\" projects cause environmental damage hardly distinguishable from that perpetrated by the Bush administration's romance with oil, gas, and coal. But perhaps because they are \"green,\" the administration gives short shrift to the National Environmental Policy Act and other laws that require weighing alternatives and environmental impacts.The locations chosen for many such projects are landscapes that tribes have valued and used for millennia, that remain critical to their cultural identity. They are associated with the tribes' traditional origins and beliefs; they are home to culturally valued plants and animals, places associated with spiritual practices, places where the bones of ancestors are buried. Interior effectively ignores such tribal concerns, while pretending to do the consultation required by law and (supposedly) administration policy.In cases like the Ocotillo Wind Energy Facility and the Genesis Solar Energy Project, both in Southeastern California (See https://turtletalk.wordpress.com/tag/ocotillo-wind-energy-facility-project/ and http://www.basinandrangewatch.org/Genesis-Updates.html), Interior's \"consultation\" has worked like this:1. Interior categorizes tribal interests as having to do with \"cultural resources\" - by which it means archaeological sites. 2. Before contacting tribes, Interior tells the energy companies to do archaeological surveys. 3. The companies hire archaeologists to do the surveys - and can fire them if they find anything bothersome. 4. Interior puts the results of the surveys in draft environmental documents. With the companies it drafts plans for the solar arrays and wind generators to be sited so as to miss the specific places the archaeologists say are significant. 5. Then Interior invites the tribes to consult.  6. When they meet, Interior presents the archaeological plan and asks the tribes to sign on. 7. When a tribe says \"wait a minute, this whole landscape is significant to us; it's not just archaeology,\" Interior says, in essence, ---\"OK, we'll consider whether it's really significant - after we approve the project.\"  8. Interior then officially determines that the environmental impacts are acceptable in light of the benefits the project purports to offer, and approves the project.The tribes, for the most part, support clean energy development; indeed some are doing it on their reservations. What they don't support is ill-considered destruction of their cultural environments, without the opportunity to influence what is done. Some argue that alternatives to industrializing the desert should be given priority - like rooftop solar arrays and solar panels over canals (as is being done in India). At the very least they want to be consulted about where the windfarms and solar arrays will be located, rather than having this decided in advance and being \"consulted\" only about how to miss particular concentrations of artifacts. But tribal objections - lodged with the Secretary of the Interior and the President himself - have gone unanswered.The Quechan Tribe brought suit against Interior seeking to halt the Ocotillo Wind Energy Project, but in early 2013 the U.S. District Court dismissed the Tribe's request for Summary Judgment, saying that it had to give deference to the agency's determinations. Other tribes, unable to muster the legal firepower to challenge the government, just quietly fume over what's being done to them.On February 12, 2012, Chairman Anthony Pico of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians wrote to President Obama. After explaining that his tribe did not oppose clean energy but did want to protect its sacred lands, Chairman Pico said:\"We invite you, Mr. President, to visit the proposed project area and to walk the land with us to see for yourself what sacred land looks like, lands that have been left the way the Creator made them and that should not be opened to industrial renewable energy development.\"He went on:\"We also respectfully request you direct those charged with implementing your renewable energy development policy to follow the letter and spirit of the law....\"If Chairman Pico ever received a response to his letter it has not been made known. The president never walked the land with the Kumeyaay, and the project proceeded.Other projects are being planned, and will doubtless be similarly approved. Interior has found a way to satisfy the courts' minimal standards, and clearly doesn't care what it does to the environment and tribal cultural values.It would be nice to think that Sally Jewell, Obama's new Secretary of the Interior, would be more responsive to tribal cultural concerns, but without support from her boss, the anthropologist's son, the chances don't look very good."}, {"title": "You Can Take the Monkey Out of the Wild, But You Can't Take the Wild Out of the Monkey", "text": "Today I received a message from Tim Ajax, the Director of our Primate Sanctuary in Dilley Texas. Tim oversees the over 600 primates residing at the 186 acre facility. The Sanctuary is the only one of its kind in the U.S. in that the majority of its residents live in free-ranging groups in natural enclosures of several acres, providing a safe, permanent home for its residents. Many of those who live there were rescued from roadside zoos, research facilities, or private possession just like Brodi, the pet spider monkey who was killed on Saturday in Ohio.Tim wrote:\"On Saturday, January 18, a young spider monkey named Brodi was humanely killed in Ohio in order to send his head off for rabies testing, despite the fact that he had recently received a rabies vaccination. His crime was having bitten the thumb of an employee at a car dealership who reached into a vehicle (with permission) to pet the monkey. State law requires the testing to be performed when the animal involved is not domesticated and, unfortunately, there are currently no reliable alternatives to directly testing the brain for the disease. A very sad ending for a very young life, especially considering several accredited sanctuaries reached out to officials with the offer of quarantine and life-long care for him. Sad as it is, the reality is that his unnatural death was a mostly predictable conclusion to a very unnatural life.While his wild counterparts were clinging to their mothers 24 hours per day in the upper canopy of a rainforest, little Brodi was stolen from his mother by a breeder, wrapped up in human clothes, and forced to learn how to nurse from plastic and rubber. While his wild counterparts were busy day and night, learning all the lessons their mother and group had to offer, little Brodi was being taught how to keep his clothes and diaper on, take a bath, and stay out of trouble. He even learned to walk on land - something his wild cousins never do, as they're too smart to come down to ground level and risk being killed by predators. In an attempt to mimic some of his natural environment he was given toys, and blankets, and small ropes to swing from - and a steel cage.Day by day, unnatural lessons were reinforced, natural instincts were suppressed, and he was treated like a small human child. He was no doubt loved by his captors, but some behaviors are hard-wired: you can take the monkey out of the wild, but you can't take the wild out of the monkey.While his free-roaming relatives thousands of miles away were busy going about their lives high in the treetops, Brodi sat in the backseat of a car at a dealership in Vermilion, Ohio and did what many primates do when they feel threatened or are having a bad day: he bit the perceived offender - and that was the end for him.\"I join Tim, as do all my colleagues at Born Free USA, in the fight to stop the epidemic of wild animals as pets.

That is, what nations have put the most climate-changing pollution in the air? It's no small question in international discussions, as different countries point fingers and debate who should do the most to solve this crisis. Looking at overall emissions today paints one picture, but seeing the historical record may change your perspective.Overall emissionsA recent report from Concordia University in Montreal details which countries have been the largest contributors to climate change, dating back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Not surprisingly, the world's most powerful economy, the United States, has put the most pollution into the global atmosphere. In fact, we produced about one-fifth of all greenhouse gases over the last two centuries or so.The top emitters also included three historically industrial economies and three emerging powerhouses. Russia kicked in 8% of the pollution, while Britain and Germany were each responsible for 5%. China has contributed 8% of historical emissions; and Brazil and India added 7% of the total. In all, these seven countries produced more than 60% of all the greenhouse gas pollution since 1790.Emissions on a per-capita basisThe picture is a little different when you look at it on a per-capita basis: That is, how much pollution does each country produce per person. From that point of view, Britain, which kicked-off the Industrial Revolution and has the smallest population of the seven, had the highest amount of pollution per citizen. The U.S. was second. China and India, with their large populations, were only 19th and 20th. In other words, each Briton and American produces a lot more pollution than do people in China and India.You might say that the historic records don't matter. We need to cut pollution today, and the fact that a given country did or didn't add pollution in the past is irrelevant. If China is the current top emitter, which it is, then who cares that they are historically below the U.S., or their per capita contribution is lower?In one sense, that's true. What matters is cutting pollution today, and if China is polluting a lot then we can't solve the problem unless China cuts emissions a lot. But look at it from their perspective for a moment. For two hundred years, Western nations have built wealth and power by burning fossil fuels.Now, just as China and India are working their way out of poverty - trying to bring up hundreds of millions up from deprivation to the kind of comfortable lives we have in the U.S. and Western Europe - they are being asking to radically cut their use of those fuels. If the situations were reversed, I'm sure Americans would resent having to fix a problem created mostly by other people.Acknowledging the past while improving the futureThe fairest thing to do would be to require each country to contribute as much to the solution as they did to the problem. But, unfortunately, fairness won't get the job done in this case. The British, who as individuals did the most to cause it, are not going to be able to do the most to solve it - their economy is only 2.8% of world GDP.And the Chinese, who are 20th on the list as individuals, are collectively the world's largest polluters, so they're going to have to be a big part of the answer. And with our vast economy, and position as the most influential nation, we are going to have to play a very big role.So as we focus on what needs to be done, let's not forget how we got here. My tongue-in-cheek headline to this post aside, it's not a matter of blame, it's a matter of approaching the discussion with an understanding of the historical reality. As a great nation, we have to accept responsibility for leading the world toward a solution to a problem we had a lot to do with causing.This post originally appeared on EDF Voices"}, {"title": "Japan's Whaling Ship, Used For 'Scientific Research,' Gets Halal Food Certification", "text": "Japan's whaling mothership has been awarded a halal certificate to prove the whales it takes from the Antarctic Ocean are slaughtered in accordance with Muslim law, a company spokesman said Wednesday.The Nisshin Maru was certified last year before it headed off to the southern ocean for this season's controversial hunt, a spokesman for ship owner Kyodo Senpaku, said.\"Special inspectors examined the ship when it was docked in Hiroshima last year,\" he told AFP. \"It was certified officially on November 24.\"The inspectors advised workers on the factory ship to change the disinfectant liquid used for cleaning hands to avoid any possible contamination from the alcohol solution, he said.\"If whale meat, which is by-product of the research whaling, can be consumed as a good protein source for Muslims in Japan, I think it is a good thing,\" he said.The company made the move after one of its business partners suggested whale meat be made halal to increase the choice of meat available to Japan's Islamic community, he said. Muslims are barred by their religion from eating pork.The government does not produce official figures on the number of adherents to minority religions in Japan, but the Japan Muslim Association told AFP there were around 100,000 Muslims in Japan -- less than 0.08 percent of the population.The commercial hunting of whales is prohibited in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, which was designated by the International Whaling Commission in 1994, but Japan catches the animals there under a \"scientific research\" loophole in the moratorium.It makes no secret of the fact that they end up on plates and the results of the research the programme is carrying out are not readily available.Militant environmentalist group Sea Shepherd annually pursues the whaling fleet through the ocean in the hope of disrupting the hunt.Earlier this month they claimed the Nisshin Maru had been separated from the other vessels and the hunt was in disarray, although Japanese fisheries officials said it was business as usual.News of the halal certification came as international attention was focused on the small town of Taiji in western Japan, where fishermen have slaughtered dozens of dolphins.Copyright (2014) AFP.

The World Resources Institute, a non-partisan environmental research organization, has put together a detailed timeline of some of the most extreme weather events of 2013, using data from NOAA's most recent report and supplementing it with other outstanding phenomena.\"We've seen very low precipitation or very high precipitation depending on where you are in the world,\" Kelly Levin, a senior associate at WRI and a co-author of the timeline, told The Huffington Post. \"And then across the board, we're seeing a significant number of record temperatures being broken -- all of which is certainly consistent with what models suggest will happen in changing climate.\"Take a look at WRI's timeline, below:Last year's high temperatures were only the latest in a long series. 2013 was the 37th consecutive year in which the average worldwide temperature was higher than 57 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the average global temperature for the 20th century. In other words, not since 1976 has Earth's average temperature been below that mark, according to NOAA's data.So far, all the years of the 21st century, including 2013, have ranked among the 15 warmest on record. In addition, two of the three warmest years that have occurred on record -- 2010 and 2005 -- were in the 21st century, with 1998 being the other. Check out NOAA's full report for a detailed analysis.The extreme weather timeline is \"far from comprehensive,\" its authors write on the WRI blog, but it serves as \"a reminder of the extreme events that have touched every community on the globe -- their citizens, ecosystems, and infrastructure.\"\"As we live in a world where we're seeing these events that are supposed to happen one in every 1,000 years or one in every 100 years happen much more often, are they truly considered extreme or is this the new normal we\u2019re living in?\" Levin told HuffPost. \"Certainly the last few years suggest that we\u2019re going to have to redefine what a normal climate looks like.\"Levin added that the extreme weather events seen in 2013 were consistent with models of climate change, and that unless humanity can reduce its collective carbon footprint, more extreme weather is likely.\u201cSince extreme weather events and natural catastrophic loss events have been documented before 1980, there\u2019s been a growing trend. In a warmer world, the consensus shows that certain events will become more frequent and intense,\" said WRI research analyst and timeline co-author Forbes Tompkins. \"What was extreme today or was extreme in 1980 might become the new normal at some point.\u201dHere are 10 of the most extreme weather events from around the United States in 2013, according to WRI's timeline:"}, {"title": "Santos The Baby Ocelot Loves Playing With His Best Friend Blakely The Dog (PHOTOS)", "text": "So, this is what it looks like when you've found your best friend for life.This is Santos, an 11-week-old ocelot kitten born at the Cincinnati Zoo.

Rhino Horn", "text": "I was definitely shocked when I first heard that the Dallas Safari Club was auctioning off a Namibian permit authorizing the hunting of an aged black rhino \"in the name of conservation.\"Corey Knowlton, who purchased the permit at auction for a mere $350,000, was also in shock over the permit situation this past week. His shock came from being unable to anticipate that millions of people wouldn't think what he was doing was such a great idea. Mr. Knowlton claims he's been forced to hire private security to protect himself and his family from a mounting number of \"death threats\" in response to the rhino hunting permit. It feels like there is some form of 'irony' to this (morally unacceptable irony, of course).During all of my travels through Africa and research on the subject of rhino conservation I've come across many things that don't often get discussed, which should truly shock us:Something that may shock you (in a good way) is that a living rhino is actually worth more (in economic terms) than a dead one. African countries whose major industries center around travel and tourism, and where rhinos had previously gone extinct, are finding the potentials in their reintroduction to be quite profitable. Living rhinos as a commodity, is partially why South Africa and Namibia's management of their white rhino populations have been, up until recently, quite successful.And one thing that shouldn't shock anyone; educating the world to the facts about rhinos will help us get through this:"}, {"title": "End of Infrastructure as We Know It", "text": "Infrastructure is always talked about in hyperbole such as, \"We must rebuild and upgrade America's infrastructure to restore the greatness of the nation,\" or \"The marvel of 20th Century public works ushered the United States into an era of immense prosperity and progress.\" It is always talked about as a job creator, the underpinnings of economic success and how the U.S. is a global leader. Rarely do we look at how infrastructure is the root cause of most of our problems today.Take cars for example. They get blamed for suburban sprawl, seas of parking lots and a culture of emissions. Without the extensive network of streets, bridges, tunnels and highways, we could not drive the amount we do. If we didn't drive as much as we do, we would not have produced all the carbon emissions we have. We wouldn't need petroleum. The Deepwater Horizon accident would have never happened and the Canadian tar sands would have little value. But to say cars are the cause of all the problems completely overlooks the role transportation infrastructure plays in allowing it to occur.Another example is energy infrastructure. The massive debate about renewable energy versus fossil fuels centers around fuel types. There're some rumblings about the energy grid itself -- but always from the perspective that we need to upgrade it to a smart grid. However, easy accessible electricity as a standard home amenity is fairly new, in fact more recent than the industrial revolution. Perhaps the greatest expansion of gadgetry in the history of the human race, the electric grid didn't really exist until the mid-1900s. Since then, we have developed millions of devices, gizmos and buildings to run off electricity. Dams, wind farms and coal plants have been built to supply the grid, and in the process we have poured more carbon into the atmosphere than we know what to do with. You can blame inefficiencies within architecture. You can say that if our televisions or kitchen appliances were more efficient things would be better. That's a fair assessment, but without the electric grid we would have no ability to use the amount of fossil fuels we have.Dreams of Our Fathers The infrastructure of our fathers is the manifestation of a simplistic view -- one that believes we are destined to divide and conquer the wilderness. In many ways, the herald of Route 66 (which after all is just another piece of infrastructure) stretching across the country is the final chapter of our founding fathers' vision of a tamed western land. Wherever there are massive utility projects or heavy, grey infrastructure, you will find inescapable ecological problems. If you trace the sources of the raw materials that go into these massive efforts of infrastructure, you will find communities taken advantage of, water poisoned, air dirty and land contaminated.Everyone knows the plight of West Virginia towns caked in toxins from years of mining. The same can be said for modern marvels of our society. The only difference is that the horrors of computers, solar panels and dams are hidden in places like China, Mexico and other developing countries.Old Infrastructure is not the New Sexy Old infrastructure is not sexy. We use it everyday in the form of roads, waterworks, energy grids and communication systems and barely notice. It's merely a means to an end. In our polarized political atmosphere, infrastructure is a battlefield where one side uses it as an instrument to justify job creation while the other stabs it as a line item to be cut from the national budget. We, as a public, are left asking rhetorical questions such as, \"Which side is right, and what is it's most effective use?\" But we never ask infrastructure to solve the problems it has created.When we see the terrible damage from levees failing, what do we blame? It's never infrastructure. The truth is that levees are the best example of our old ideal for conquering the wild. Build a wall to hold back oceans, rivers and seas. Pump the rest of the water out of the area and call it dry land. Then we build cities, towns and neighborhoods in flood zones. The infrastructure gives us a false sense of security. When the walls begin to crack and homes are destroyed, we still don't blame the systems themselves. We blame nature, sea level rise, climate change and underfunding of infrastructure. We never look at the fact that our man-made dry land is, and has always been, underwater. The end game, when fighting the ocean, is defeat.You know what's sexy? Nature is sexy. But listening to engineers, political figures and advocates, we can't focus on just how sexy it is. They are screaming at us that America's infrastructure is falling apart and if we don't fix it we will be marooned on the sands of missed opportunity. But in the face of bridges falling, rolling blackouts, levees breaking, dams flooding and energy grids failing, do we depend too much on this old world infrastructure? Can we evolved beyond the divide and conquer mentality of wilderness to embrace a new more right-sized reality?America's Brand New Promise Roadways are in disarray. Water systems are overstressed and communities face extraordinary risks from climate change. But do we really need all the highways and interstates we have? It's time to rethink infrastructure, not regressively but to embrace the fact we don't need so much of it. That is, at least, the more humble sentiment. The more honest truth is that we can't afford it. We built the majority of the infrastructure in the U.S. when materials and labor were cheap. That's no longer the reality. We are competing globally with other countries for resources and materials like steel and concrete that drive up prices. Labor, or more exactly, skilled labor, demands a livable wage. You must use skilled labor if you want the stuff built to work right, and that comes at a cost.In a recent interview, I explored with my co-host and Byron Stigge a different option for infrastructure. One that is resilient but not overpowering. One that is nature-based but not inhumane. So often, advocates for infrastructure remain us that the U.S. was once number one in the world for infrastructure. Now we are ranked far down the list. We shouldn't rest our sense of self on the size of our biggest dam or largest skyscraper. We've been there, done that. Leadership isn't about doing the same thing over and over. It's about showing that a new path is available and achievable. If we want to stay relevant and show true leadership, it will not come by retaining the infrastructure of the 20th century. In our new and dynamic age, old approach is a losing battle. It's time to say goodbye to infrastructure as we know it. There's something much more exciting on the horizon."}, {"title": "Bird Steals 'Egg Camera', Films Penguin Colony From Air (VIDEO)", "text": "A fascinating aerial perspective of a penguin colony has surfaced online recently from the most unlikely of videographers: a camera-snatching bird!The incredible footage was posted by John Downer Productions and will be included in the BBC series \"Penguins - Spy in the Huddle.\" Downer writes:A striated caracara, intrigued by our spy egg-cam, decides to fly off with our camera but in the process captures the first ever aerial footage of a rockhopper penguin colony shot by a flying bird.From what we've seen so far, we're thinking that this bird has a real future as a professional cameraman, err, camerabird!

It was the size of a coke can and just cork-screwing really slowly towards me,\" fisherman Stewart Fraser told ONE News.Though hesitant at first because of its odd appearance, Fraser brought the sea creature aboard and snapped a few photos.The animal has since been identified as a sea salp, a marine invertebrate with a gelatinous body. Salps are typical found in the Southern Ocean, where they feed off phytoplankton. While the salp Fraser found was apparently by its lonesome, the sea creatures tend to live in colonies and often form long luminous chains to swim and feed as a group, according to National Geographic.While rather common, salps may be hard to spot because of their camouflaged appearance.\"Their transparency is quite remarkable,'' Dr. Dennis Gordon, a marine biologist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told The New Zealand Herald.Researchers at the National Marine Aquarium speculated that the animal is a Salpa maxima, the Daily Mail reports.

Last week, fishermen captured and trapped 250 bottlenose dolphins, and they killed 30 of them just yesterday.The drive hunt is barbaric. The fishermen use small motorized boats to locate pods of dolphins and other small whales, and begin herding the animals toward shore, using the noise of the boats' engines and the banging of pipes underwater. There are reports, too, of the use of underwater explosives. Once the animals are on the shore or in the shallow bay, fishermen then get into the waist-deep water and move through the pods, stabbing animals to death, in full view of the other pod members. These highly intelligent animals are slaughtered for meat, pet food, and fertilizer. The fishermen spare the best specimens and sell them to marine parks, consigning them to a less violent but still grim fate, abducted from their families, never to return to their natural homes, and sentenced to life in concrete tanks.In the late 1980s, marine parks and aquariums (including U.S. parks) and the U.S. Navy began purchasing live animals from Japan, paying many thousands of dollars for each animal. This contributed to the profit-making of the Taiji hunters. In 1993, a California marine park sought to import several dolphins from Japan, but the U.S. government stipulated that the dolphins could only be imported if they had been captured \"humanely.\" Because the capture violated the conditions of the permit, the government prohibited the import. Since then, no dolphins have been imported into the U.S. from Japan. However, there are other markets and willing buyers to take the animals, mainly in Asia and the Middle East.In response to all this, there have been global demonstrations, boycotts, congressional resolutions, the global distribution of The Cove, and most recently, Ambassador Kennedy's courageous statement. All the while, Japanese officials have defended the slaughter and capture as their cultural right, retorting that U.S. citizens eat beef and hunt animals for sport. The Taiji hunt, whilst the most notorious, is one of a number of hunts of dolphins and small whales conducted in Japanese waters. In any one year, in combination, these hunts may claim the lives of some 20,000 cetaceans.But there has been some progress in Japan. A growing number of supermarkets in Japan have stopped selling whale and dolphin meat, including AEON, Ito-Yokado (7-Eleven's parent corporation), Seiyu, and more. In addition, our supporters have helped us end the sale of dolphin meat on Internet market sites like Amazon and Google. However, Yahoo! Japan continues to sell whale and dolphin meat products.The government of Japan is ultimately responsible for the killing of these highly intelligent marine mammals, known well to us for their heroic efforts to protect drowning seafarers or to protect swimmers from sharks. We can help repay these creatures for their long-standing, documented record of altruism by continuing to bring pressure on those who profit from this spectacle in Japan. In the end, we must act together make it plain that it's only a tiny fraction of people in the world who would exhibit such callousness and cruelty to animals who deserve so much better from our species.This post originally appeared on Pacelle's blog, A Humane Nation."}, {"title": "Light Bulb Angst:  Grow Up", "text": "We are told that the world as we know it will end when an overreaching government phases out incandescent lights and forces consumers to purchase more efficient bulbs. Those to the right of center claim that the government should get out of the way and let consumers make their own choices. The government cannot pick winners and losers; only the magic of the market can do that. We hear claims that this is the worst case of governmental intrusion and excessive regulation.That argument of overreach is disingenuous, tired, simplistic and wrong. Yes, in the vast majority of cases, market forces are the most efficient means of determining what should be sold at what price. Capitalism is extraordinarily successful. But we've learned from the days of the robber barons that unchecked capitalism has problems; so too have we learned since the days of Rachel Carson that the market does not always lead us to desirable environmental outcomes. The argument against phasing out incandescent bulbs is old and tired because we have been here before, hearing the same refrains of lament and grief about excessive regulation in the face of necessary and reasonable government action; and we are going through the same worn out steps to prevent the obvious; let's see how this always plays out.First we as a society learn of a potential harm caused by common practice; take smoking as an example, or the use of leaded gasoline. Industry denies any problems, and usually counters with an argument that the practice is actually beneficial. Then scientists discover and confirm that the practice is indeed harmful (smoking causes cancer; lead causes problems with neural development). Industry counters with a barrage of ads and sponsored studies with biased results to confuse the public. Nevertheless, the evidence mounts, and industry claims become more absurd and desperate. Remember the spectacle of all those tobacco executives sitting before the senate saying with straight faces that smoking does not cause cancer? Then finally, the change that should have occurred decades earlier finally does, with billions of dollars lost and millions of lives impacted or ruined. Tobacco gets regulated as a medical device; and lead is removed from gasoline. Miraculously we see none of the catastrophic consequences predicted by opponents: the world does not collapse, the economy does not stop functioning, and mom and pop stores continue to thrive in the newly regulated world.We all know the tobacco story so let's see how this scenario played out with lead in gasoline, which seems now to be taken for granted; then we'll see how this relates to the issue of incandescent bulbs beyond the obvious that both involve government regulations that ban the manufacturing and distribution of a product widely used by the general public.Dates and sources for quotes below are found here. Also, the full history of the phasedown of lead in gasoline is captured in a report authored by Richard Newell and Kristian Rogers. The economics of the phasedown is expertly described by Joel Schwartz, Hugh Pitcher et al. in a paper published in 1985.So, let's begin. In 1965, Clair Patterson published the first study to demonstrate that high levels of lead in the environment (water, air, soil) were man-made and constituted a potential health threat. Just as they would do later with climate change denials, the American Petroleum Institute countered with the claim that \"the mass of evidence proves unquestionably that lead isn't a significant factor in air pollution and represents no public health problem in any way.\" (Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 1965). Sound familiar?A few months later, in December of that same year, Harriet Hardy of MIT argued that small doses of lead could be a contributing factor to disease, and cites studies that suggest links between lead and mental retardation (New York Times, Dec. 16, p. 22). Advocates for lead claimed in testimony from Robert Kehoe (an industry-sponsored scientist) that, \"There is not enough lead in our environment to be a health hazard to anybody. Those who say there is are ignoring the substance of the scientific work that has been done\" (Washington Post, Dec. 19, p. A14). This went back and forth, until the pendulum began to swing decidedly against the industry. In 1971, Ethyl Corp. officials claimed to be victims of a \"witch hunt,\" (sound familiar again?) complaining that environmentalists were using \"scare tactics\" (chorus line) by blaming lead for the fall of the Roman Empire. By 1977, the evidence for lead's ill-effects on health was beyond doubt. Testing by public health scientists showed causation between high levels of lead in children's blood and brain damage, hypertension and learning disorders. Later, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that leaded gasoline is the greatest source of atmospheric lead pollution. In June 1980, the courts affirmed in Lead Industries Association v. EPA that EPA regulations for the phase-out of leaded gasoline could be implemented.So industry leaders first disputed that lead in gasoline was the source of lead in the water and atmosphere (somewhat like those who later would claim that climate change is a hoax); when that proved unviable, they said, sure, but lead in the environment was not a health hazard (sure, climate change is real but not caused by human activity, a natural variation of no concern). When that proved untrue, they argued that opponents were organizing a witch hunt using scare tactics to mask the horrific economic consequences of regulating lead (environmentalists were scaring the public about climate change to advance an extreme left-wing agenda of eco-terrorism). Today you don't hear anyone arguing we should still have lead in our gasoline. Why? \"Thousands of tons of lead have been removed from the air, and blood levels of lead in our children are down 70 percent. This means that millions of children will be spared the painful consequences of lead poisoning, such as permanent nerve damage, anemia or mental retardation.\" By 1983 we also learn that the benefits of the lead phase-out exceeded its costs by $700 million in just a few years.Let us not forget in the face of this economic and public health success that the predictions of economic ruin and regulatory overreach were quite stark as industry tried to rally opposition to regulating lead. I have seen no apologies or admissions of error. Just silence; which is striking given the stridency of the opposition, and how incredibly wrong they were. Here are just a few examples:\u2022 Oil industry representatives testified to EPA that the lead phase-down would cause them to lose profits, prevent them from funding future oil exploration, and make gasoline unaffordable.\u2022 In 1970, the petroleum industry was putting out stories that removing lead from gasoline would cause everyone's car engines to erode or explode. That, in turn, would destroy the economy, all because \"a bunch of pointy-headed scientists, doctors and public health officials\" were spreading \"chicken-little panic\" about a \"purely hypothetical and overblown danger.\"\u2022 One lead additive manufacturer ran an ad in major newspapers in December 1973, later picked up in a Washington Post article, claiming the lead phase-down would waste one million barrels of oil a day.\u2022 Phillips Petroleum estimated that producing unleaded gasoline would consume between 300,000 and 600,000 barrels of additional crude oil a day and require from $8 to $15 billion in refinery capital investment.Of course none of that nonsense proved to be true; the only truth is that removing lead from gasoline caused no economic disruption, but did result in important health, environmental and economic benefits.And so now we come to another government phaseout of a product considered by the public to be a normal part of daily life, the incandescent bulb. The first order of business is to explain the significant benefits of banning incandescent bulbs. The argument for government intervention to institute and enforce the ban is every bit as compelling as that for removing lead from gasoline.Energy efficiency is the greatest and most obvious return on the investment away from incandescent bulbs. Two options exist, compact fluorescents (CFL) and light emitting diodes (LED); we can consider CFLs as an intermediate technology, with its own set of problems, including mercury disposal. LEDs are the wave of the future. Compared to traditional bulbs, LEDs use at least 75% less energy and last 25 times longer, usually rated at least at 100,000 hours. An LED circuit gets close to 80% efficiency, meaning 20% is lost as waste heat. Regular bulbs are the inverse; 20% efficiency, while 80% is lost as heat.At the national level, DOE puts annual energy savings by 2030 from LED use at about 300 Tera-watt-hours (TWh), even with only moderate market infiltration. That is enough electricity to power 24 million homes every year, at an annual savings of $30 billion at today's electricity prices. That translates to nearly 180 million barrels of oil, each year, oil that we would not import from the Middle East -- one more step toward energy independence. So we can power 24 million homes simply and forgo 180 million barrels of oil every year simply by changing some light bulbs, which in the end cost less over the bulb's lifetime than incandescent bulbs. The move is a no-brainer, yet the market would not allow for this outcome because the initial purchase price (for now) is higher. Only by government regulation can we get to the obviously desirable endpoint within any reasonable time frame; and of course as LEDs get manufactured in every-greater numbers, the unit cost will go down, further underlying the validity of the phaseout policy.Concerning personal benefits, if you use a 100 Watt incandescent bulb for one year, with an electrical cost of 10 cents/kilowatt hour, you will spend $88 on electricity to light the bulb. Of that, $70 will have been used to heat the room, all wasted energy. Instead, with an 80% efficient LED bulb, the electricity cost would be $23 per year. In fact, the cost savings would be higher because most incandescent light bulbs blow out within a year; LED bulbs can used go a decade without burning out.Sadly, predictably, the right wing brings out all the same objections they brought to the table with the phaseout of lead. The repetitive song goes like this: there is no problem; well, if there is a problem, it is being exaggerated by the left; okay, there is a serious problem, but government has no role to play in finding a solution -- only the magic of the market can do that. They were wrong then, they are wrong now on all counts.One prominent blog has the headline, \"If energy needs to be saved, there are good ways to do it. Government product regulation is not one of them.\" Note the question of whether we even need to save energy. That is rather odd in itself since the idea that we need to save energy and become energy self-sufficient has been a bipartisan position since the Nixon administration. The parties split is on how to achieve the goal.So where does the bulb phaseout fit into this debate? The phaseout has actually been in progress since 2007, when Congress passed and George Bush signed into law an energy bill that placed new efficiency standards on light bulbs. In 2012, the manufacturing of the familiar tungsten-filament 100 watt bulb was discontinued. In 2013 that ban included 75 watt bulbs. In January, the manufacturing ban was extended to 40 watt and 60 watt bulbs. All older-style bulbs can be sold until supplies run out.Just as with the rather ridiculous and exaggerated claims about the calamities that would befall all of us if we removed lead from gasoline, we hear similar refrains about the catastrophic consequences of eliminating incandescent bulbs. And yet, just as with lead removal, the economy did not collapse as the bulb phaseout was implemented. Consumers did not starve in order to afford new bulbs. The government did not come marching in black boots into our living rooms to remove old bulbs. And just as with lead, right wing opponents ignore or deny the obvious benefits derived from the regulations, benefits that would not be forthcoming if market forces alone were brought to bear on the problem.In spite of the significant benefits of moving away from an early-industrial- age product, even in the face of clear benefits to energy self-sufficiency and national security, even in light of the enormous environmental benefits, the right wing remains stuck in sclerotic opposition, learning nothing from their earlier failures. The Heritage Foundation loudly proclaimed that \"the government's taking away your light bulbs on Jan. 1.\" Think how absurd this headline would be if it read, \"the government's taking away the lead in your gasoline on Jan 1.\" The original quote will seem equally absurd in a few years' time.Government regulations can and very often do indeed go too far; laws can overreach. Implementation and enforcement can be expensive, inefficient and intrusive. All of that is true, which means we must always be diligent and fight against government excess. But knee-jerk reactions to all government regulation, even those essential and reasonable, destroy any credibility in fighting regulations that legitimately should be resisted. Fighting against actions that clearly benefit individuals and society alike does nothing but delay what should and needs to be done. Los Angeles does not look like Beijing only because of government regulation, forcing the auto industry into adopting catalytic converters and regulating tailpipe emissions (along with regulations of the energy industry as well). I lived in southern California throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the air was thick and tasted like metal. The air is breathable now exclusively and solely due to \"excessive\" government regulation. No market forces would lead to that outcome. If you are among those who believe government has no business regulating industry, then live in China for six months and see if you retain your beliefs. Traffic deaths are down significantly because the government makes you wear seat-belts in a car and helmets on a bike. You can eat food in restaurants and produce from grocery stores with confidence because those industries are regulated by government. Hot dogs contain meat instead of rat hair and feces because of government regulation. Air travel is safe because of government regulation of airline maintenance and duty cycle rules for pilots. Water is safe to drink because of government oversight and regulation. Buildings and freeways withstand earthquakes because of government regulation. The drugs you take are the safest in the world because of government regulation.The government rightfully banned incandescent bulbs. Get over it; stop the whining, learn from the past about ridiculous opposition to reasonable regulation, and focus instead on problems of real government overreach -- you know, like starting a war based on fabricated intelligence. The move to LEDs should not be fodder for partisan politics and is only because the right opposes all regulations without thought. Time to start thinking."}, {"title": "25 Percent Of Sharks And Rays Face 'Alarming' Threat Of Extinction: Study", "text": "A staggering percentage of the world's sharks and rays are now \"alarmingly\" close to the brink of extinction, according to the a new study spearheaded by the Shark Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The study -- said to be first global analysis of the conservation status of 1,041 shark, ray and related species -- found that at least one in every four existing species of sharks and rays may soon be wiped off the face of the planet. The shrinking numbers are largely due to overfishing, the researchers said.\"Our analysis shows that sharks and their relatives are facing an alarmingly elevated risk of extinction,\u201d said Dr. Nick Dulvy, one of the study's co-authors, according to a media release. \u201cIn greatest peril are the largest species of rays and sharks, especially those living in shallow water that is accessible to fisheries.\"A collaborative project that involved more than 300 experts from 64 countries, the study also found that chondrichthyes -- the class of cartilaginous fish (so-called because their skeletons are made of cartilage instead of bone) that includes sharks, rays and chimaeras -- are at a \"substantially higher risk than most other groups of animals and have the lowest percentage of species considered safe -- with only 23 percent categorized as 'Least Concern.'\"Researchers say they were also troubled to find that rays are generally even more threatened than sharks are. Rays like sawfish, wedgefish, guitarfish and stingray, for instance, are among the top 10 most-threatened families of chondrichthyes.\u201cWhile public, media and government attention to the plight of sharks is growing, the widespread depletion of rays is largely unnoticed,\" said study co-author Dr. Colin Simpfendorfer, per the release. \"Conservation action for rays is lagging far behind, which only heightens our concern for this species group.\u201dThe IUCN created an infographic summarizing the study's findings. Scroll down to peruse it. Story continues below infographic.Sonja Fordham, co-author of the study and deputy chair of the Shark Specialist Group, told The Huffington Post that though sharks are perhaps \"more charismatic\" and \"naturally fascinating\" than rays, people need to understand that the two groups of animals are actually closely related and face \"a lot of the same threats.\" Fordham also said that some rays, including sawfish and guitarfish, are valuable for the shark fin soup market.Fordham, who is president of the conservation group Shark Advocates International, told the HuffPost that she hopes the study's findings will not only raise public awareness of the plight facing sharks and rays, but will also kickstart global action to protect these animals.\"A lot of progress has been made, but we do need to pick up the pace,\" she said of shark and ray conservation efforts. \"We need to expand the scope of our efforts and recognize that we need to do a better job in the employing of safeguards for the whole group -- the rays, as well as the sharks.\"According to the IUCN, sharks, rays and chimaeras are \"one of the world\u2019s oldest and most ecologically-diverse groups of animals.\"To read the full IUCN study on sharks and rays, click here."}, {"title": "Oil Trains Spilled More Crude Last Year Than In The Previous 38 Years Combined", "text": "A new analysis of government data shows that more oil was spilled from trains in the U.S. in 2013 than in every year between 1975 and 2012 combined. Railcars released more than 1.15 million gallons of crude oil last year, reports McClatchy's Curtis Tate, while only a combined 800,000 gallons were spilled in the previous 38 years.The analysis used data from the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and does not include the deadly July 6 train derailment in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, that released an estimated 1.58 million gallons of oil and killed 47 people.Questions have arisen about the safety of transporting oil by rail, as the number of \"mobile pipeline\" trains has increased relative to an oil production boom in the central U.S. in recent years. Much of this boom (and the source of the crude oil in many of the recent oil train spills) is centered around North Dakota and the Bakken formation. Ten percent of all U.S. oil production now comes from this 200,000-square mile rock formation, which also underlies parts of Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.North Dakota currently produces several hundred thousand barrels of oil daily, exceeding the capacity of the existing pipeline infrastructure. This -- along with producers' preference for selling the oil on the east and west coasts, which are largely inaccessible by most pipelines but where the oil fetches a higher price -- has led to a surge in oil-by-rail shipment. The railroad industry shipped only 9,500 carloads of crude oil in 2008. That rose to 234,000 by 2012 and continues to grow.Despite high-profile oil train derailments in North Dakota and Alabama, among others, McClatchy's analysis of the oil spilled from tank cars in 2013, as a share of the total volume of oil shipped by rail in the U.S. that year, jibes with the railroad industry's stated 99.99 percent safety record.Oil train crashes may be statistically infrequent, but the shipment of Bakken crude presents one notable challenge. The PHMSA announced on Jan. 2 that the crude oil being transported from the region \"may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil.\"Regulators have begun to pay increased attention to oil train safety and shipping practices in recent months, although federal investigators have known about oil train safety issues, like overweight and mislabeled railcars coming from the Bakken formation, since at least the fall of 2011.Following a closed-door meeting with federal regulators last week, the railroad industry agreed to implement voluntary safety improvements over the next month. \"The industry, if they are motivated, can undertake preventative steps that will enhance the safety of the movement of these materials across the country,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said, according to the Associated Press."}, {"title": "Bill Nye: I'm 'Optimistic But Terrified' About The Future (VIDEO)", "text": "Right now, wildfires are blazing in Australia, floods are devastating some Pacific island nations and the U.S. East Coast is back in polar vortex conditions.

Only one other major line -- the 400,000 bpd Seaway -- runs from Cushing to the Gulf, and it has been pumping at well below capacity.TransCanada said its pipeline will initially ship 300,000 bpd, rising as the company tests its new system. Alex Pourbaix, president of the company's pipeline division, said he expects that shipments will average 520,000 bpd over 2014.The company has already begun construction of a lateral line to Houston that is expected to be in service later this year. When the lateral is complete, TransCanada will be able to boost the capacity of the Gulf Coast line to 830,000 bpd.The line should eventually help lower stocks at Cushing, the pricing point for the New York Mercantile Exchange's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract, North America's benchmark oil price. A surplus of crude at the storage hub has depressed U.S. oil prices, with WTI trading well below crudes priced on the European Brent benchmark.It may also help alleviate steep discounts on Canadian crude, which dropped to more than $40 per barrel below the WTI benchmark in November.\"It should strengthen WTI a little bit because it will further relieve the bottleneck in getting crude from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the U.S. Gulf Coast,\" said Patricia Mohr, commodity market specialist at Scotiabank.KEYSTONE SPARRINGMeanwhile TransCanada and environmental groups continue to spar over the line's safety and whether the crude will be destined for export markets. In theory, if certain conditions are met, shippers could seek permission to export Canadian crude oil via Gulf Coast ports, experts say.\"President Obama made the wrong decision to fast-track this export pipeline and citizens will keep TransCanada accountable for every leak, spill and tragedy on families' land and water,\" Jane Kleeb, executive director of Bold Nebraska, said in a statement.And once Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge Inc starts up its 600,000 bpd Flanagan South pipeline later this year, more heavy Canadian crude will flow into Cushing and down to the largest U.S. refining hub along the Gulf Coast, where refineries are largely configured to run heavy oil.\"It shows that with or without Keystone XL's northern leg, Gulf Coast refineries will be processing heavy Canadian crude,\" Bill Day, spokesman for Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. refiner, said. \"There's just such a market demand for it, it's going to get here one way or the other.\"Valero is also among the Gulf Coast refiners seeking to increase access to Canadian crude via rail. The company plans to start up a Canadian crude offloading facility at its 205,000 bpd St. Charles refinery in Norco, Louisiana, in the first quarter this year and is considering a similar project at its 290,000 bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.TransCanada shares were up 43 Canadian cents to C$48.90 by mid afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange."}, {"title": "The Real Truth About Rescuing Dogs -- and Wolves", "text": "When you bring a dog home from a shelter or adopt one from a rescue, you're doing a noble thing. You're taking a dog whose days might be numbered, and giving him a new lease on life. Perhaps the dog immediately takes to your family, fits right in, and never displays major behavioral problems. Good for you! But, unfortunately, that's not the way it goes for everyone. Many of us who rescue or adopt dogs have adopted challenges along with them that must be worked through. It's not something you'll see on those tug-at-your-heartstrings commercials, but it's the truth.In addition to having been a canine behavior specialist for close to the last quarter century, I've always been involved in rescue. There have been the dogs I rescued personally, the ones I worked with in Los Angeles city shelters, and the wolves and wolfdogs at the rescue center I co-ran--three of whom I ended up bringing home. The road has not always been an easy one. Over the years, as I've dealt with various behavior issues with my own dogs, I've discussed them openly in my books and blogs. Dog owners and even other trainers seem to appreciate hearing about the struggles and problem solving, rather than just reading about how wonderful things are. And so, in the spirit of honest sharing, I offer a few excerpts from my latest book, Hit by a Flying Wolf: True Tales of Rescue, Rehabilitation and Real Life with Wolves and Dogs.My husband and I rescued Bodhi, a malamute mix, and Sierra, a husky mix, from separate shelters. Not only did they each have behavior problems--and believe me, Bodhi had enough for five dogs--but at the start, there were conflicts between them:There were periods when I'd have a few minutes or even a few hours where I felt more optimistic about Bodhi--and then something else would happen. Two weeks after we brought him home, I was taking a much-needed break from the book I was writing about separation anxiety. I was lying on the living room couch reading, with a box of peanut butter crackers wedged between my body and the back of the couch. Sierra came walking up through the narrow corridor formed by the couch and the coffee table. She sniffed the air and then the couch. I patiently explained that although peanut butter was indeed one of the world's finest inventions, the crackers weren't for her. Just then Bodhi approached from the opposite direction. Now the dogs were nose to nose in a very small space, with me in the middle. Before you could say \"Not good,\" a snarkfest broke out. Jaws clacked and snarls filled the air as the dogs lunged at each other. I wedged the book between them (now, there's one advantage of a solid book over a Kindle) and simultaneously sprang up, employing reflexes I didn't know I still possessed. Sierra seemed scared, while Bodhi just looked puzzled. I calmed the dogs down, put the crackers away, and made a mental note that the Fear of Clacking Jaws Diet could be quite the effective deterrent against late afternoon couch snacking.Dogs aren't the only ones who come with issues. For years I co-ran Villalobos Rescue Center with my friend Tia Torres--this was years before Pit Bulls & Parolees came along, when the center was dedicated to rescuing only wolves and wolfdogs. Amongst other duties, I went out on house calls to assist owners so they could keep their animals, transported wolves to the rescue, and did socialization and training with the residents. Then, for reasons explained in the book, I brought three of them home to live with me. As you might imagine, wolves aren't exactly like dogs, and they presented some serious challenges. That they hadn't had the best start in life didn't make things any easier, either. Like so many rescue dogs, Heyoka, a mostly-wolf, had an intense fear of people; it took a long time for me to even be able to touch him. As you might imagine, veterinary visits weren't the easiest....This particular veterinary office had seen a lot of the rescue's animals over the years. None had ever fazed the burly gang members-turned-vet-techs. These guys had wrangled huge Pit Bulls, wolves, and everything in between. But they hadn't met Heyoka. C.C. and I watched from the waiting room as a dark-haired, twenty-something tech strode confidently toward the holding area in the back. Ten minutes later, he emerged covered in a thin film of sweat, and called for another tech to assist him. The two disappeared. Fifteen minutes later they both reappeared looking sweaty, disheveled, and with a distinct deficiency in the swagger department. \"We need the catch pole,\" one panted to a third tech, who looked at them and asked, \"You wrestling alligators back there or what?\" Three techs and thirty minutes later, Heyoka was safely back in the crate.I don't mean to give the impression that life with the wolves and dogs has been nothing but difficulties. The love, trust, moments of bonding and affection, and near-magical turnarounds in behavior and spirit are more than worth all of the time and effort. My goal in writing Hit by a Flying Wolf is, beyond simply offering what is hopefully a fascinating read, to inspire owners to not only feel better about the struggles they're having with their own dogs, but to hang in there and keep trying, even when behavior problems cause disruption, frustration, and challenges. Sometimes true change can take months, or even years. But when we take animals into our homes and families, in the end, the effort is always worthwhile. Just ask Bodhi, the dog I thought I'd never bond with; he's lying quietly by my side as I type this, and I absolutely love him.

Here are seven potential game-changers.1. The Year of Cities: How Will They Grow?We're currently in the midst of the most massive urban transition the world has ever seen. Cities are projected to add 274,000 people every day over the next 30 years. By 2040, the urban population will be more than 2 billion higher than today.Here's the point: How cities grow -- economically and demographically -- will be critical in whether we fail or succeed in the fight against climate change and poverty. Poorly designed, sprawling cities can exacerbate existing greenhouse gas and congestion problems. (Cities already account for 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and some cities already lose 10 percent of their GDP to congestion alone). Alternatively, compact, low-carbon cities -- featuring sustainable transport systems and people-centric design -- can improve quality-of-life and drive economic opportunity.A growing number of city leaders are beginning to act -- and often showing more vision and action than national leaders. This year could significantly accelerate this trend, as a number of key meetings of city leaders can help build political momentum. In February, mayors from the C40 (a group of more than 60 global cities committed to action on climate change) will gather for a summit meeting in Johannesburg. And other major gatherings of mayors in Singapore in June and Colombia in April offer opportunities for best practices to be shared and replicated.But nowhere will the focus on cities be greater in 2014 than in Brazil as it plays host to the World Cup. All eyes will be on the 12 cities where games will be played.One the most urbanized, large countries in the world, Brazil, has already experienced some of the worst problems of pollution and inequality -- as well as some of the most inspiring innovations that are benefitting both citizens and the environment. Urban transport illustrates both. Vehicle emissions caused more than 4,600 premature deaths in Sao Paolo in 2011, and in June last year, more than 1 million protestors took to the streets to demand better urban transport systems and other city services.At the same time, a new national law requires 3,000 cities to create people-centered city mobility plans by 2015. One hundred cities already have bus-rapid-transit (BRT) systems in place that carry more than 12 million passengers per day.What image of Brazilian city life will remain in the minds of the 3 million extra visitors and the 3.2 billion World Cup television viewers -- and what impact might it have? And, as Brazil faces elections and urban unrest, will its city and national leaders pursue a path towards greener and more efficient cities?2. Restoration: A Two Billion Hectare OpportunityEvery minute of every day for the past 13 years, the world has lost an area of forest the size of 50 soccer fields.The greatest tragedy is that much of all the forest we have lost now has little economic or ecological value. WRI has mapped two billion hectares of such degraded land -- equivalent to twice the size of China -- and shown that much of it can be turned from wasted and unused land into forests, agricultural fields, and other productive uses.Some countries are beginning to seize this opportunity. The Bonn Challenge, a global commitment for restoration established in 2011, calls for 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land to be restored by 2020. Restoring this amount of land could bring $84 billion in economic benefits annually and close the greenhouse gas \"emissions gap\" by one-fifth.Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Rwanda and the United States have already made commitments to the Bonn Challenge, pledging to restore a collective 20 million hectares. This year could be a year of increased momentum. As leaders seek ways of addressing climate change in a way that would boost rather than reduce jobs and incomes, restoration could emerge as the greatest \"win-win\" of all. Countries will meet again in Bonn in June to potentially seek additional pledges, and the Heads of State Summit on Climate Change in September offers another opportunity to bloom into a global movement.3. Sustainable Palm Oil: A New Era?Palm oil has become one of the most ubiquitous ingredients -- found in everything from candy bars to cosmetics to cooking oil. More than half of all supermarket items contain it, and its demand will continue to sky-rocket as the global \"middle class\" rises from two billion to five billion between 2010 and 2030.But it currently comes at a very high cost: It is one of the leading causes of deforestation in tropical areas.There are signs that the traditional expansion path -- cut down the forest to plant oil palm -- may be changing. Western companies, led by the likes of Unilever, Nestle, and Proctor and Gamble, are increasingly committing to phasing out all palm oil that has been produced through deforestation. About 15 percent of world trade is now certified as \"sustainable\" by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a collection of more than 1,000 businesses, retailers, investors and NGOs working to curb deforestation. This is a good start, but so far just scratching the surface.This year could mark the beginning of a tipping point. Not only established groupings such as the Consumer Goods Forum, but also Asian-based majors such as Wilmar, the second-largest palm oil trader in the world, are now making commitments to deforestation-free production.Particularly important is the emergence of technologies that enable monitoring to take place. For example, February will see the launch of Global Forest Watch, a high-resolution, Google map-based tool showing deforestation taking place in near-real time. Developed by WRI with key partners, it provides overlays of concessions and protected areas, enabling deforestation to be identified and responsible companies named. This and other tools will provide for the first time the ability to monitor commitments, and will enable all participants in the supply chain -- including consumers, shareholders and NGOs -- to distinguish good from bad performance. This theme will be highlighted at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.Will this increased transparency encourage more sustainable palm oil? Will other industries like soy, beef and cocoa follow?4. China: Clearing the Air?In 2013, Beijing experienced a whopping 189 days of dangerous air pollution. This choking smog is due largely to China's massive coal consumption, which constitutes 50 percent of the world's total.This year will see a major step-up in action to address pollution. How effective will it be?In June 2013, China's State Council approved a $277 billion, five-year, anti-pollution plan -- the biggest ever anywhere. A ban was placed on new coal-fired power plants in China's three key cities -- Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou -- and tighter pollution regulations were put on 10 additional areas. In an effort to seek less polluting energy sources, more than half of China's new energy capacity in 2013 came from renewable energy.This year will see new spending and policy innovations come into force. The pilot cap-and-trade system in five cities and two provinces will be implemented for the first time.How will it go? Will it indicate that China will be ready for nation-wide implementation, as is currently planned? What will leaders learn from these initiatives? And will it indicate that China can shift away from coal and toward cleaner energy sources?5. A New Standard for U.S. PowerLast year's announcement by President Obama of a comprehensive U.S. Climate Action Plan -- which reaffirmed the national target of reducing emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 -- now needs to be implemented. Power plants account for one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, so reducing these emissions represents one of the most important opportunities.On June 1, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is scheduled to announce new guidelines for existing power plants. (Just last week, they entered the rules for new power plants into the Federal registry). According to WRI analysis, meeting the 17 percent target will require that these regulations reduce power plant emissions by 31 percent by 2020 and by 74 percent by 2035 (below 2011 levels).Critics will claim that this would impose too high a price on the economy. How effective will those critics be? There is mounting evidence that if the regulations are strong, but flexible, the costs will be small and manageable, and that smart regulations can boost technology and competitiveness.Already nearly 100 coal-fired power plants have closed in the United States in the past two years. And the Union of Concerned Scientists recently showed that nearly half of the remaining 1,050-odd coal-fired plants are old (43 years on average) and ripe or ready for replacement.This year will also see the opening of the path-breaking Kemper power plant in Mississippi, applying carbon capture and storage at scale. Will the stories be about the era of CCS finally arriving, or more about cost and schedule over-runs?   6. The Year of Global Momentum on Climate Change?U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon will host a heads-of-government summit on climate change in September -- probably the largest meetings of global leaders on climate ever. Its intent is to create political momentum in the lead-up to the planned global climate deal to be finalized in Paris in December 2015. Will it?The coming months will see the unveiling of major analytical reports that could influence the Summit outcome. In March and April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will issue its crucial reports on the impacts of climate change and on policy options. In the summer, a major report on the U.S. economy, Risky Business, will be issued. Sponsored by Tom Steyer, Hank Paulson and Michael Bloomberg, it will provide new evidence on the sharply increased risk the United States is imposing upon itself by not leading more vigorously on climate change. And finally, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, led by President Felipe Calderon, Nick Stern and Luisa Diogo -- and comprising a stellar group of global political and business leaders and some of the world's top economists -- will issue its report, The New Climate Economy. This will provide the most up-to-date evidence on the benefits and costs of climate action.   Will all this evidence, coupled with the growing concerns about extreme weather events, be enough to create incentives for firm action? What's clear is that the world is currently heading in the wrong direction -- towards a three to five degree Celsius rise in temperatures. Could 2014 change that?7. The Year of Elections: Which Way Will They Choose?It's likely that more people will vote in democratic national elections this year than in any other in history. The stakes are high: Three of the world's four largest democracies -- Brazil, India and Indonesia -- will elect heads of government this year.Together, these countries account for 25 percent of the global population and 40 percent of the world's poor. In each of these nations, there are crucial issues relating to social, economic, and environmental futures. The European Union will also hold its elections at a time when European leadership on sustainable development is under threat form political and economic pressures in some member countries. And the mid-term Congressional elections in the United States will influence whether the country can be a global leader on climate and energy.Moving from current patterns of production and consumption toward a path that is more productive, equitable and sustainable is a choice. And 2014, more than most, is a year of choices."}, {"title": "Weather on Steroids: Elaborating on Jon Stewart's Takedown of Trump", "text": "It's freezing all over the country, you look at places like Texas they're setting record lows and Oklahoma where they've never had problems, they're having snow... well it's a hoax. -- Donald Trump, Fox and Friends, January 6, 2014This winter has seen the coldest weather in decades throughout much of the United States. Temperatures in the Midwest have been dangerous. The weather, though less cold along the coast where I am, has been more unpredictable. On one Monday, the temperature in Providence, RI was close to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The following two mornings, it was near single digits -- a nearly 50 degree difference.\"It's cold,\" the deniers are ready to proclaim. \"This is not global warming.\"As if one or two arctic blasts could refute the reality of climate change. Ironically, these extreme cold snaps are really pieces of evidence that our climate system is growing more unstable, as climate change models have predicted since the 1970s and as our observations now show.For those who haven't been paying close attention, for every new climate assessment that is released, the forecasts are getting worse -- greater global temperature increase (particularly at the poles), greater sea level rise, bigger and more violent weather extremes. Expect the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report due out in the Spring to be even more stark as new models start to better account for the growing threat of methane emissions from the melting permafrost and warming seabeds, where frozen methane crystallites accumulate in massive quantities.Despite the increasingly gloomy outlook for the planet, climate scientists are careful not to say any particular storm or other weather phenomenon is caused by climate change. The scientists' reticence is due in part to an unwillingness to appear \"political\" and thus endanger the grant funding that makes their work possible, but more specifically because they are being approached with an invalid question.Rather than asking if this or that hurricane is a result of global warming, the question ought to be how much of all the weather that the planet is experiencing is caused by climate change? While storms appear to be discrete events, they are manifestations of a planetary system fueled by the hydrological cycle.Here's a nice way of understanding this systems perspective of climate that's been getting some traction:Barry Bonds hit 24 home runs as a 24-year-old in 1988 when the IPCC was first formed. Thirteen years later, as a 37-year-old (a geriatric in baseball player years), Bonds hit a world record 73 home runs. There's a lot of speculation about how many of those home runs can be attributed to performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). And while you could ask baseball experts to look at one of those blasts and ask if it was steroids, you would get a similar look out of that analyst as you would from a climatologist asked about any single storm.The truth is we don't go back and look at each homer Bonds hit to try and figure out what his real number was, because every swing of his bat was in some part attributed to the PEDs. We say the whole season of hitting was tainted, steroids influenced all 73. Every home run of that era in baseball is now looked at suspiciously as a manifestation of a systemic sportwide use of drugs.Likewise, all weather, extreme or not, is now a result of our systemically changed climate (aka climate change). So, I will say what the scientist will not: Our freezing weather is the result of global warming. This polar vortex descended on us because arctic warming combines with increasing amounts of water in the atmosphere to produce instabilities in the jet streams that normally keep arctic weather up north. We should expect such vortexes more frequently in the future as arctic temperatures continue to rise faster than elsewhere and more water gets absorbed into the hotter atmosphere. I admit that this theory is simplistic and probably incomplete, but what is certain is that climate change played a role in this weather, because it is playing a role in all weather.Watch Jon Stewart make Trump look silly below.Let us waste no further time in debating the reality of climate change. The globe is warming, the weather is on steroids. We are experiencing it daily. It's time now to start dealing with the damage we've done and to start doing everything we can to stop it from getting worse. And please, Mr. Trump, stop suggesting that cold weather disproves climate change.Click here to put Trump in his place."}, {"title": "The Open-Office Backlash", "text": "Despite criticism, open workspaces are still the smartest solution.Ever since companies began tearing down walls to replace private offices with open space, there have been plenty of naysayers, and the latest is Maria Konnikova in The New Yorker.

Pointing to old perceptions -- noise and lack of privacy -- she calls the open office a \"trap\" that \"may be ingraining a cycle of underperformance.\" Yet, in her criticism, Konnikova overlooks the greatest value of the open office -- it's dramatically more sustainable.By \"sustainable,\" I mean that open offices are at once economically, environmentally and socially smarter. First, they're significantly more efficient with space. For most offices the maximum utilization rate throughout the day is only about 48 percent. In other words, companies build, lease, furnish, heat, cool and light more than twice as much space as they need at any given time. As a result, the federal government is reducing the average area per person in its facilities from about 250 square feet to 150 -- a 60 percent cut. Some of that savings will come from telecommuting and other flexible policies, but it also will rely on a different space strategy. My firm has found that we can improve the area per person 20-35 percent simply by converting to open offices. For a large company, this can save millions in lease and utility costs every year.\"For its new London office, RTKL reduced the area per person by 34 percent and discovered a 24 percent decrease in operating costs, a 30 percent increase in impromptu meetings, and 25 percent more social engagement.\"  Photo: Jonathan Banks / Photobanks Ltd.Cutting area also considerably slashes energy and emissions. If every office building in America shrank by just 10 percent, greenhouse gases would decline by the equivalent of taking seven million cars off the road. The Environmental Protection Agency recognizes open work plans as a standard strategy for saving energy because, even without reducing the area of a building, fewer partitions make it easier to distribute artificial light and mechanical air at lower quantities with less equipment. But open space also allows natural light and outside air to spread more easily, lowering dependence on electrical systems. Many smart office buildings require no artificial lighting at all during the day, and this simply cannot be achieved with too many walls.Beyond saving energy and money, the psychological effect of bringing in more of the outdoors is possibly the single biggest benefit of open offices. Ten percent of absences can be attributed to having no view of the outside, while daylight, fresh air and positive views can relieve stress, fatigue, headaches and other ailments. Research shows that in spaces with positive views of the outdoors, office employees perform 10-25 percent better on tests of mental aptitude and memory recall, while cubicles with higher partitions lead to lower performance. In its new headquarters, healthcare giant GSK found that moving to open workspace improved decision-making speed by 45 percent.What of noise and lack of privacy, Konnikova's primary complaints? Actually, if designed well, the acoustics of open offices can be more comfortable than traditional offices. Analysis shows that low partitions with highly absorbent materials can reduce noise transmission 24 percent more than full-height drywall partitions, and suspended acoustical \"clouds,\" which absorb sound on both sides, can reduce reverberation time by half with much less area than a continuous ceiling. The General Services Administration has found that taller partitions in cubicles may provide more visual privacy but not necessarily more aural privacy, and in fact the perception of greater isolation can encourage talking louder, which actually diminishes privacy and creates more distraction.\"Physical barriers have been closely linked to psychological privacy,\" Konnikova notes, citing a 34-year-old study that predates most open offices and the entire revolution in personal and mobile computing, which has liberated the modern office worker. No longer chained to their desks, people can work anywhere at any time, inside and outside the office. A typical goal for the contemporary workplace is a one-to-one ratio between seat counts for individual versus collaborative work (meetings, etc.). So there are plenty of places to slip away for private tasks or quiet time, as well as much more opportunity for shared events and casual, unplanned interaction, which can instill a more tangible sense of community.Fourteen years ago in The New Yorker itself, Malcolm Gladwell proclaimed that in open offices people now can get \"all the social support they need-all the serendipitous interactions that serve to make them happy and productive.\" This might be why GSK found that within two weeks of its move, most employees said they'd never go back to cellular offices.

But since a freakishly warm March in Chicago a couple of years ago when I snapped photos of Andrew running through a backyard sprinkler in his bathing suit, I've been educating myself about climate change. I've read books and studies, watched online lectures and panel discussions, and what I've learned keeps me up at night.It also makes me wonder: If I'm this anxious about the future, in which temperatures are expected to soar, sea levels to inundate coastal areas and weather extremes like droughts and floods to compromise fresh water and food supplies, how are climate scientists faring? How do the people most \"in the know\" ward off despair? Where do they find hope?I've started asking them, and already I've learned two extraordinary things: 1) even scientists who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Gore often answer their own emails and agree to talk with a writer they don't know, and 2) the overwhelmingly complex problem of global warming is, in some ways, simpler than many of us think.\"It's not rocket science,\" says Dr. Alan Robock, Distinguished Professor of Environmental Science at Rutgers University. He explains that we already have the technology to mitigate climate change, but we aren't deploying it quickly and fully enough. \"We have to stop putting carbon dioxide into the air as fast as we can, and that means switching to solar and wind power for our energy.\" The best way to incentivize that, Robock believes, is through \"a gradually increasing carbon tax so that [renewable energy sources] become cost-effective.\"Dr. Richard Somerville, Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Research Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, agrees. \"It's the total amount of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses that determines the amount of climate change, the degree of warming,\" he says. \"It's pretty simple.\"How optimistic is he that we'll shift away from fossil fuel energy in time to avert the most catastrophic consequences of global warming? In terms of technology, very optimistic. \"The switch to renewables is very doable,\" he says. But he also feels a sense of political pessimism: we are not yet acting with the urgency required.Dr. Terry L. Root, Professor and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, is blunt about the evidence she's collected in her studies of the effect of temperature on wildlife. Root says we're en route to a mass extinction in which as many as half the world's species will die out, and she sees no way off that path. But we can lessen the number of species lost and, in the process, increase our own ability to adapt.How hopeful is she for the future? That question elicits a long sigh. What's needed, she says, is the rapid deployment of renewable energy resources, particularly wind and solar energy, so that we can stop burning fossil fuels. \"But we have to have the political will.\"  That's the refrain I'm hearing from scientists who study the atmosphere, the ocean, the polar ice caps, the biosphere: the only hope for mitigating global warming is to stop burning fossil fuels. Climate is an infinitely complex system, but one reality is not: the more greenhouse gas emissions we produce, the quicker average global temperatures will rise to the point where human survival will be difficult at best. And the less of these gases we produce, the less drastic climate change will be. It's that simple.Of course, simple does not mean easy. Shifting the global economy from non-renewable to renewable energy requires tremendous effort and collaboration, locally, nationally, and internationally. And it must be done quickly.But, daunting as this challenge may be, none of the scientists I've spoken with so far believe we're doomed. Root says she's \"really glad that people are the cause of this CO2 going in the atmosphere. Because we're causing it, we know how to fix it.\" Of the political will necessary, Robock is optimistic. Humans are \"inventive, creative beings,\" he says, and remarkably open to collective change. \"Ten years ago, who would have thought we'd have a black president and gay marriage?\"I find that sentiment comforting, at least by the light of day. In the middle of the night, in the aftermath of a \"polar vortex\" that's in line with what climate models predict, the bright side is harder to see. But of course the best hedge against despair is action, and political will starts with individuals. Now is the time to make noise, to contact leaders and representatives, to protest and insist and imagine a near future in which renewable energy becomes cheap and plentiful, staving off the worst of global warming. We can do this. That's what climate researchers keep telling me. In the middle of the night, while checking on my son, I have to believe them."}, {"title": "Climate Change Means More Intense Precipitation In Some Places, Even Snow", "text": "This story first appeared on Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.We all remember \"Snowmageddon\" in February of 2010. Even as Washington, D.C., saw 32 inches of snowfall for the month of February\u2014more than it has seen in any February since 1899\u2014conservatives decided to use the weather to mock global warming. Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe and his family even built an igloo on Capitol Hill and called it \"Al Gore's New Home.\" Har har.Yet at the same time, scientific voices were pointing out something seemingly counterintuitive, but in fact fairly simple to understand: Even as it raises temperatures on average, global warming may also lead to more intense individual snow events. It's a lesson to keep in mind as the northeast braces for winter storm Janus\u2014which is expected to deliver as much as a foot of snow in some regions\u2014and we can expect conservatives to once again mock climate change.To understand the relationship between climate change and intense snowfall, you first need to understand that global warming certainly doesn't do away with winter or the seasons. So it'll still be plenty cold enough for snow much of the time. Meanwhile, global warming loads the dice in favor of more intense precipitation through changes in atmospheric moisture content. \"Warming things up means the atmosphere can and does hold more moisture,\" explains Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \"So in winter, when there is still plenty of cold air there's a risk of bigger snows. With east coast storms, where the moisture comes from the ocean which is now warmer, this also applies.\"Why does the atmosphere hold more moisture? The answer is a key physical principle called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, stating that as atmospheric temperature rises, there is an exponential increase in the amount of water vapor that the air can hold\u2014leading to more potential precipitation of all types. (A detailed scientific explanation can be found here.)Indeed, scientific reports have often noted the snow-climate relationship. An expansive 2006 study of US snowstorms during the entirety of the 20th century, for instance, found that they were more common in wetter and warmer years. \"A future with wetter and warmer winters...will bring more snowstorms than in 1901-2000,\" the paper predicted. There is also a clear increase in precipitation in the most intense precipitation events, especially in the northeast:Percent increases in the amount of precipitation occurring in the heaviest precipitation events from 1958 to 2007. US Global Change Research Program.\"More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern U.S., and less for the Southwest, over this century,\" adds the draft US National Climate Assessment. Precipitation of all kinds is expected to increase, the study notes, but there will be large regional variations in how this is felt.\"The old adage, 'it's too cold to snow,' has some truth to it,\" observes meteorologist Jeff Masters, co-founder of the Weather Underground. \"The heaviest snows tend to occur when the air temperature is near the freezing mark, since the amount of water vapor in the air increases as the temperature increases. If the climate in a region where it is 'too cold to snow' warms to a level where more snowstorms occur near the freezing point, an increase in the number of heavy snowstorms is possible for that region.\"In fairness, global warming is also expected to decrease overall snow cover, because intense snow events notwithstanding, snow won't last on the ground as long in a warmer world. In fact, a decrease in snow cover is already happening.Today's snows will usher in a new northeast cold spell, not as intense as the \"polar vortex\" onslaught of two weeks ago but still pretty severe. But a temporary burst of cold temperatures doesn't refute climate change any more than a major snowstorm does. Indeed, we have reasons to expect that the rapid warming of the Arctic may be producing more cold weather in the mid-latitudes in the Northern hemisphere. For an explanation of why, listen to our interview with meteorologist Eric Holthaus on a recent installment of Inquiring Minds (from minutes 2 through 12 below):None of this is to say, of course, that global warming explains single events; its effect is present in overall changes in moisture content, and perhaps, in the large-scale atmospheric patterns that bring us our weather.Still, that's more than enough to refute conservatives who engage in snow trolling."}, {"title": "Grassroots: Why the Startup of Keystone XL South Makes Us Stronger", "text": "The sun feels good on my shoulders. The skin on my knees tingles from kneeling. My hands are stained orange by red dirt and my fingertips will be cracked and sore tonight.In front of me is a tiny clump of grass. As I pull at it, blades come off in my hand but roots buried deep in the soil refuse to let go. The grass is rhizomatic. It has deep roots and if you cut them apart they multiply. This farm will be pulling grass out of garden rows for years and someday, when this farm is gone, the grass will take back over. Roots that were never fully dormant will shoot up and grass will cover all this ground again.As a writer there is a tension between what I feel I should write and what I need to write. Keystone XL South is beginning full operation. The story I should write is about the hundreds of known anomalies along the pipeline, the landowners who had their homes wrongfully taken, the indigenous communities already devastated by tar sands extraction, the people who live near the pipeline and don't know they are at risk, the rivers and streams that stand to be changed forever.There are times, however, that I must write for myself. Keystone XL South cuts through my community and puts my home and family in danger. The things I should write feel too painful and don't offer comfort or encouragement. The story I need to write therefore centers on this tiny clump of grass and the roots I cannot see.When rhizomatic plants are pulled apart they separate into new life. They hold nutrients in their roots and spread out laterally, shooting up far from their origins. In many ways adversity makes them stronger. Although it hurts and is hard, there are ways the startup of Keystone XL South is making a grassroots movement stronger.In the last two months, in the time since TransCanada announced the startup, new life has shot up and reserves of energy and wisdom have offered strength. Frontline communities along the route of Keystone XL South have come together to voice perseverance and tenacity, offering solidarity in a shared struggle. Landowners have gotten media attention and made progress with legal action. Community groups have found new energy and motivation to continue working for the safety and health of their homes. Grassroots resistance is growing.Although frequently used and broadly understood, the origins of the term \"grassroots\" are unclear. It seems likely, however, that this idea came from a farmer. Only someone who has spent hours pulling at blades of grass and never fully getting the roots could offer this prayer for social change -- that those who wish to create the world do so by being stubborn like the grass. Within this tiny, often unarticulated metaphor lies all the encouragement, grit, and dedication a movement could wish for its participants.The clump of grass in front of me tells the story of a movement made up of people stubbornly fighting for life. As grassroots organizers, activists, and community groups our commitment is to the things we hold most precious -- children, fragile wetland ecosystems, trees planted years ago, the elderly, and the morning air. We love the things we are fighting for and so we dig our hands deeply into the soil of our work. We send out roots in all directions and we allow the things that threaten to pull us apart to give us new life. Our belief that someday our vision will cover everything in a carpet that is lush and green allows us to dedicate ourselves for the long haul.I imagine a day that the roots of plants and trees and the dreams of people reach down into the soil to pull out pipelines that threaten us. The tiny metaphor of the roots of grass is offered as a wish for grit, encouragement, and dedication to all of those who are impacted by tar sands extraction and transportation. May we be like the grass and may days like the startup of Keystone XL South encourage us to cultivate our roots."}, {"title": "Upping the Ante on Climate Change Media Coverage", "text": "The top story on Thursday's New York Times mobile edition was titled \"U.N. Says Lag in Confronting Climate Woes Will be Costly.\" Why was the newspaper featuring a story on something that's so unpopular? Just one year ago, the paper had to cancel its green blog and disbanded its climate change group. And the story wasn't even exclusive: The report was first leaked to Reuters, whose partners were able to scoop the Times, as did The Huffington Post.  No paper likes to highlight stories where it has been scooped, much less one that's won as many Pulitzer Prizes as The New York Times.  Released by Reuters and its partners on Wednesday and by Times.com on Thursday (and the Times print edition on Friday), the U.N. report has been floating around for some time now. And yet as of Monday, only a few news sources have run it. Other national newspapers, such as USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, have not. Neither has my local paper, the Seattle Times.  And though The New York Times recently committed to increasing coverage of climate change, according to the prevailing wisdom, that won't do much for that paper's readership. For it seems that only 32 percent of Americans worry that climate change will affect them personally, and that's not enough for mass media to run stories. In fact, newspaper coverage of the issue has declined from peaks in 2007 and 2009, tracking media in general.  TV news, specifically shows that still have influence, i.e. Sunday morning talk shows, don't believe their audiences have any interest at all in climate change. ABC's This Week, NBC's Meet the Press, CBS's Face the Nation, and Fox News Sunday together ran just 27 minutes on the issue in all of 2013.  Last week, Climate Solutions' KC Golden's blog Grip on Climate published a letter sent by nine senators to four networks demanding more climate coverage. The senators suggested a cynical reason for the networks dearth: \"We are more than aware that major fossil fuel companies spend significant amounts of money advertising on your networks. We hope that this is not influencing your decision about the subjects discussed or the guests who appear on your network programming.\"  Predictably, Fox News' response was to ridicule the senators for the \"same type of censorship Chavez used in Venezuela,\" with government regulators holding \"an implicit gun to (the networks') head,\" \"... the beginning and the end of free speech.\"  Anther panelist Michelle Fields asked, \"How much more do they want to hear? ... Every single day, MSNBC and CNN are talking about global warming and it's not a coincidence that every single day their viewership gets smaller and smaller because Americans are tired of hearing about this.\"And there's the rub. The ultimate tragedy is when no news is simply bad news. As Golden says in an earlier post quoting a female focus group participant, \"... I don't think climate change is a big issue, because nobody's doing anything about it.' Golden adds, \"She made the eminently logical inference that if it were really as bad as all that, the responsible authorities would be doing something...\"And the news outlets would be doing something too.That's why I'm thrilled that The New York Times is talking about climate change. Last Friday's print edition carried three stories on the subject, two on the leaked U.N. Climate Report and another on the European Union's intention to back off on its climate intentions due to ongoing economic pressure.As America's Newspaper of Record, The New York Times tends to lead news coverage and set the standard for other news organizations. Bravo to the Times for taking this brave stance. Where would this country be without continuous if unpopular coverage -- in my lifetime -- of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the aftermath of 9/11? Those subjects made heroes out of the news organizations that insisted on uncovering them.  Climate change coverage might not really be much of a gamble after all."}, {"title": "Leaders at Davos Must Address the Critical Issues the World Faces -- Call from Civil Society Leaders", "text": "To the political and business leaders gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos:As representatives of civil society organizations attending the World Economic Forum, we are writing to urge you to ensure that the following issues of critical global importance are central to discussions at the forum and that, as per its stated purpose, the forum helps to deliver the insights, initiatives and actions necessary to respond to them. 1. Securing a safer world: As the forum takes place thousands of innocent people in Syria, including many children, continue to die. As vital peace talks kick off in Geneva, the crisis in Syria emphasises why we must work together to guarantee both immediate humanitarian access and aid, as well as secure long-term solutions to end crises -- especially in Syria, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Afghanistan -- and find ways to prevent future outbreaks of conflict and violence.2. Picking up the pace on development and setting ambitious goals for the future: In 2000, the world agreed the Millennium Development Goals with the aim of reducing extreme poverty by 2015. We have witnessed significant progress, but, with less than 800 days to go to the 2015 deadline many goals are off track. Failure to achieve the goals translates into children and women dying from preventable causes and in childbirth, and millions of people living in poverty without enough food or water. We need the leaders at Davos to get behind efforts to finish the job on the MDGs and engage fully in discussions around the next set of development goals in order to help eradicate extreme poverty for good.3. Tackling inequality: In this changing world, rising inequality is a potent challenge. The top 5 percent of the world's population is understood to have over 37% of global income, whilst the bottom 5 percent has less than 0.2 percent. As the IMF and the World Economic Forum itself have highlighted inequality is a fundamental obstacle to sustained economic growth. Leaders at Davos must recognise the importance of addressing inequality and ensure it is at the heart of future development efforts.4. Creating a liveable climate for all: We cannot eradicate poverty without addressing climate change, which is hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest. 2014 will be a crucial year to mobilize action ahead of global climate negotiations in 2015. Leaders at Davos should be clear in their commitment to ensuring a bold climate deal is delivered. The private sector leaders at Davos have a particularly critical role to play in leading the way to a low-carbon, climate-change resilient future. The new climate partnerships expected to be launched at Davos must also drive action at scale and have governments at their heart.5. Investing in young people's potential: Young people are shaping our world but they need support to ensure they have the education, training and opportunities to do so and a safe environment to thrive in. The Forum is an opportunity for leaders to identify new ways of working together to create the jobs and opportunities needed and help deliver a world where every young person is protected from violence, gender discrimination and the absence of opportunity. To deliver all the above, we need responsible government, responsible business and new ideas where old ones have failed. Davos is a unique opportunity to display this in practice. As civil society organisations we look forward to being active partners in the process.

Roughly 100 communities nationally, including Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, have banned plastic disposable sacks or imposed a fee on them.\"We're trying to make our city a cleaner and greener city,\" said Councilman Brandon M. Scott of Northeast Baltimore, who sponsored the bill. \"This is a good step for us to be a sustainable city moving forward.\"Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake will sign the legislation if the council approves it, according to her spokesman. But Council President Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young called the measure a regressive tax that would hurt those who could least afford to pay it.\"They think it's going to clean up the bay. It's not going to do that,\" Young said. \"Are you going to ban soda bottles because they end up in the bay? I keep saying this is a people problem. I don't care what you impose, it's not going to stop littering.\"To address a concern of merchants, businesses would keep 3 cents from the fee to cover administrative costs. Jeff Zellmer, senior vice president of the Maryland Retailers Association, said the figure is reasonable.\"We don't really welcome it, but the train's coming down the road, and we accept it,\" Zellmer said.Scott said that the nickel fee imposed in Washington and Montgomery has been successful in reducing litter and that businesses are saving money by providing fewer of the giveaway bags. Supporters say plastic bags, in particular, harm the environment and often blow into waterways that feed the Chesapeake Bay.A spokeswoman for Target declined to comment on the pending legislation. Giant Food of Maryland said in a statement that officials would study the proposal.Bag manufacturers oppose the bill. According to the American Progressive Bag Alliance, an industry group, about 30,800 American jobs, including 200 in Maryland, depend on plastic bag manufacturing and recycling.Mark Daniels, chairman of the alliance, disputed claims that imposing a fee on disposable bags reduces litter. He said in written testimony that the charge would contribute to Baltimore's highest-in-the-state taxes.\"A ten-cent tax will only make trips to the grocery store more expensive,\" Daniels wrote. \"It will also be detrimental to local businesses because some consumers will begin to shop outside the city in order to avoid the tax.\"Councilman James B. Kraft, chairman of the committee that approved the legislation in a 4-0 vote, said the city attempted to work with retailers and grocers to voluntarily reduce plastic bag usage about three years ago. But the law, which stops merchants from giving shoppers a plastic bag unless they ask for one, didn't work as intended, he said.\"The real folks we were going after -- the big guys -- still to this day are not just ignoring it but flagrantly violating the law,\" Kraft said. \"The question isn't whether we're going to invoke the fee, it's how much it's going to be.\"Finance officials said it is hard to estimate how much revenue the fee would generate, but Kraft said the city could expect at least $1.5 million in the first year. The money is projected to decrease annually as more people get into the habit of bringing reusable bags to shop.The fee would be collected by the retailers, which would face fines for not complying. The city would charge interest and penalties for late payments and require businesses to compile reports on bags distributed and money collected.The bill would exclude bags used to carry hot or cold cooked foods, prescriptions and fresh produce and meat. It would cover most retailers, including pharmacies and convenience stores. But farmers' markets could still give bags without charge.The legislation, which would take effect July 1, seeks to direct the revenue to a fund to clean up the city's parks, streams and harbor. But because the council currently has no power to direct spending, the money would go to the general fund.Kraft said he planned to introduce legislation to ask voters in November to approve a city charter amendment giving the council the power to earmark money for environmental initiatives.Rawlings-Blake's spokesman, Kevin R. Harris, said the mayor would be agreeable to having the money split between the general fund and those initiatives.Kraft said the primary aim isn't to raise money but to encourage Baltimoreans to use reusable sacks. And with fewer bags in the waste stream, Kraft said, the city could eventually save money on environmental cleanup.Julie Lawson, director of the Trash Free Maryland Alliance, testified Tuesday that studies prove surcharges dramatically reduce plastic bag use and promote sweeping changes in behavior.In Washington, a recent survey found 80 percent of residents changed their behavior after the five-cent fee was imposed in January 2010, according to Lawson. Only 8 percent of businesses and 16 percent of residents reported negative feelings about the law, she said.\"Citizens around the city are tired of seeing plastic bags caught in tree branches, dotting roadsides and blowing down neighborhood streets,\" Lawson said.ywenger@baltsun.comtwitter.com/yvonnewenger ___(c)2014 The Baltimore SunVisit The Baltimore Sun at www.baltimoresun.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"}, {"title": "Davos: The Shifting Nature of Power and the Shifting Power of Nature", "text": "One of the most challenging weeks of my working life starts today: the week of the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.   Over 2,500 Presidents, Prime Minsters, CEOs, Celebrities and Academics with a smattering of civil society, will be holed up in a small and posh mountain resort in Switzerland to discuss, in the words of the WEF, \"improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.\"At a moment when 20th century power structures, typified by the Davos devotees, try to squeeze the last buck out of a denuded environment and a failing industrial complex, new power structures are emerging, together with new threats, new solutions and new opportunities.Many pay up to 250,000 U.S. dollars for their membership and entrance fee to the WEF. As a civil society representative I have been invited to attend the WEF over the last decade or so, without paying a fee, obviously. Why do I get invited, why are big corporates actually seeking meetings with us?I know that, like other civil society leaders, I am there to add a pinch of public participation -- there are many meetings in penthouse suites that we have no access to. Climbing an oil rig in the cold Russian Arctic to protect a critical part of the world's climate regulation system is uncomfortable, but rubbing shoulders with Davos' thousand-dollar suits is equally uncomfortable. You're probably wondering why I still do it?Well if there is any chance to have a positive influence on the business community, then I should leave my feelings of discomfort at the Davos train station and give it my best. Winning over some of the key business leaders is critical if we are to succeed in tackling the multiple challenges facing the world.Normally, these people exist behind a maze of staff, inside near impenetrable walls tens of floors high. Having the chance to speak truth to power, appeal to them as parents, grandparents and human beings, not just powerful politicians and business leaders is something worth pursuing.If we manage to shift the consciousness of one CEO or senior political leader, who may do the same with a couple of his peers, then I think it is worth it. It is also worth being there, listening and observing, understanding some of the forces that shape our world and importantly feeding that information back to the rest of Greenpeace and other civil society allies.As I have said before, the WEF is still unfortunately dedicated to system maintenance, protecting the fundamentals of the current system, broken and unjust as it is. What we need is system change. And it is changing, no amount of tinkering will hold it back forever.This year's theme is \"The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business.\" A few words from the preamble make me raise my eye brows: \"political, economic, social and, above all, technological forces... are shifting power from traditional hierarchies to networked heterarchies.\" That means the false idea of reducing democracy to the singular act of voting every few years is over. People are begging to assert participatory democracy and exercise people power, using many new technologies and methods of interconnection, as levels of confidence in political leadership are dangerously declining around the world.The WEF warns its members that we are witnessing a shift of power. But those attending the WEF are largely focused on the symptoms of various crises not the causes or the cures. Dealing with global challenges especially in the face of new, seismic trends requires a global mindset that is a comprehensive and an interconnected way of understanding how different crises intersect with one another.WEF founder Professor Klaus Schwab warns of the 'shifting nature of power', but he got a couple of words in the wrong order, the real threat to all of us, including those in the cozy Davos conclave, is the shifting power of nature.Scientists argue that most of the known fossil fuels reserves need to be left in the ground if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. Last year carbon dioxide concentrations breached 400ppm (parts per million) -- that's the highest level in human history and means we are hitting the accelerator towards mass extinctions, mass migration and mass starvation. In 2012 we saw the lowest levels of Arctic sea ice. And a frightening slew of extreme weather events: heat waves, hurricanes, droughts and record low temperatures.Business elites and politicians continue to suffer from an acute case of cognitive dissonance. All the facts are there, we need to re-think and re-design our economies, yet they are largely in denial about the scale and pace of the necessary change.The WEF's 2014 Global Report helps set the agenda and prioritization for the great and the good to discuss. Financial risk, unsurprisingly, still ranks at number one, followed by high unemployment or underemployment. Water crises come in third place with climate at fifth, behind severe income disparity. There is therefore a growing recognition that economy, ecology and equity are all in crisis; that they are all fundamentally interconnected. None can be solved without solving the others. None can be solved without accepting the physical boundaries of a resource-constrained world. The water scarcity crisis is driven -- from South Africa to China - in part by coal expansion, which is also driving climate change. While many in Davos keep us addicted to coal, an energy revolution based on renewables could generate many more jobs than business as usual.We know that we need to break the carbon-corporate control over politics. The last UN climate negotiations in November took place in Poland, one of the most coal dependent countries in the world. If that wasn't bad enough, fossil fuel companies sponsored the conference. The Polish government also hosted a summit for the coal industry at the same time. That's not ironic, it's simply outrageous. It shows us how much work we have ahead to shift our sources of power.While the WEF suggests it's members deal with the cause of the crisis, not just the symptoms, we know that we are running out of time and that the window of opportunity to avoid an ecological catastrophe is quickly closing.Yes, some progressive corporate players, either for fear of consumer pressure or because they truly get it, are changing. Only last year we saw two of the biggest paper and palm oil companies commit to end forest destruction. Our Detox campaign is helping shift the clothing industry onto a path of clean production, backed by active and networked consumers, who are seeking a new relationship with the brands they buy.The emerging horizontal power structures can work and a large part of that will be down to whether the kind of people who go to Davos understand not only the shifting nature of power but equally important they need to understand the shifting power of nature and embrace the change that is critically necessary if we are to secure this planet for human survival into the future. If they simply adopt a green front to defend their 'greenbacks' they can slow the change, perhaps enough to ensure catastrophe for all.So, off to Davos I go, armed with a copy of the 2014 Global Crisis report, a thick skin, and the support of many millions of people around the world who want to have a say in their own future and that of their children and grand children."}, {"title": "China's Pollution Efforts Only A Fifth Of What's Needed, Must Spend $330 Billion More To Do Fair Share", "text": "BEIJING, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China must increase spending on emission cuts and clean technologies by 2 trillion yuan ($330 billion) to do its fair share to halt climate change, a report by Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics said.It urged the government to raise money from carbon markets to fund investments.The report's conclusion contrasted with China's official policy that the main responsibility for ramping up action against climate change rests with developed nations.China, the world's biggest-emitting nation, has already pledged to spend 520 billion yuan to help prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2C, according to Chen Bo, co-author of the report.But that is only a fifth of what is needed if China - trailing only the United States on the list of history's biggest carbon emitters - is to shoulder a proportionate burden in global efforts to stop climate change, the report said.The main responsibility for ratcheting up the extra funds should fall on the government, it said.\"Public funding is essential to address climate change problems, and without a clear signal on CO2 emissions, mitigation projects are not financially attractive to investors,\" said the report.It called on the government to use carbon markets to auction CO2 permits to help raise climate revenue.Over the past seven months, five regional pilot trading schemes have launched in China, with plans to roll out a national market later in the decade.One of those markets, southern Guangdong, auctions 29 million permits annually to participating firms, but the revenue is not earmarked for climate change spending.The report, which has been submitted to the State Council, China's cabinet, said the state-owned China Development Bank should set up a green investment department to stimulate private and public investment in climate-related projects.It further urged the financial market to develop products and mechanisms to draw further funds.(Reporting by Kathy Chen and Stian Reklev, editing by Mark Heinrich)"}, {"title": "ExxonMobil Won't Admit Baton Rouge Plants Had Safety Violations", "text": "This article was published in \"The Louisiana Weekly\" in the Jan. 20, 2014 edition.ExxonMobil must pay $2.329 million in a settlement, announced by Louisiana's Dept. of Environmental Quality last August and finalized early this month, to address violations from 2008 into 2013 at its greater Baton Rouge facilities. The settlement was DEQ's biggest with any company last year. But critics question whether the agreement was large enough or even appropriate. ExxonMobil, a major employer in the state capital, was cited for a series of problems at its refinery and resin-finishing and chemical plants in East Baton Rouge Parish and its tank-farm facility in West Baton Rouge.In the agreement, DEQ said the settlement spares both parties the expense of litigation. The settlement was proposed by ExxonMobil and approved by the state following extensive negotiations, according to DEQ. ExxonMobil in the accord denies that it committed any violations or is liable for any penalties. But the company nonetheless agreed to a $300,000 payment to settle claims. Of that, $34,386 covered DEQ's enforcement costs against ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge-area facilities.Early this month, DEQ said the settlement was approved following a public review period late last year and was signed by state Attorney General Buddy Caldwell in December. In addition to paying a civil penalty of $300,000 to DEQ, ExxonMobil under the agreement must spend at least $1 million on Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures or SPCC projects at its Baton Rouge complex and will fund beneficial environmental projects or BEPs totaling $1.029 million. The accord gives ExxonMobil deadlines and requires the company to keep DEQ up to date on how its settlement obligations are met.In a separate penalty last August, DEQ fined ExxonMobil $61,912 for violations associated with a June 14, 2012 naphtha release at its Baton Rouge chemical plant. Naphtha contains benzene, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies as a human carcinogen. Residents near the plant said they suffered health ailments from the discharge.The final agreement contains more than 40 pages of violations for chemical releases and spills and operational infractions dating to 2008. Back-to-back incidents occurred at times. Unauthorized refinery discharges reported by ExxonMobil, for instance, were almost monthly in some years, and were especially frequent in 2008--when they totaled at least six in May alone.So what does the company say about the agreement? \"ExxonMobil worked with DEQ last year to identify ways we can go beyond regulatory and permit requirements to continue to enhance our environmental performance going forward,\" Stephanie Cargile, the company's government affairs manager in Baton Rouge, said last week. \"In addition to making direct penalty payments to DEQ, ExxonMobil will make donations to local non-profit organizations. ExxonMobil voluntarily identified several projects that would enhance the environment of neighborhoods near our operations.\" She said the company solicited input last year from neighbors and regulatory agencies--the East Baton Rouge Mayor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, DEQ and the state's Dept. of Natural Resources--to address community needs and supported their recommendations.In terms of funding, the top four BEPs approved under the settlement are $400,000 for a Groundwater Reduction Project to trim the company's groundwater usage; a $250,000 donation to DEQ to improve its Early Warning Organic Chemical Detection System; a $100,000 donation to the East Baton Rouge Mayor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness/Local Emergency Planning Committee to implement the ExxonMobil North Baton Rouge Emergency Preparedness Initiative; and a $100,000 donation to Rebuilding Together Baton Rouge for weatherproofing and air tightening of homes, especially those next to ExxonMobil facilities.What's the impetus for ExxonMobil to improve its practices in Baton Rouge? \"The only part of the settlement that seems aimed at correcting problems and preventing future emissions is the $1 million for the Spill Prevention Control or the SPCC program,\" Anna Hrybyk, program manager at the Louisiana Bucket Brigade in New Orleans, said last week.SPCC is a set of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations, implemented in 1973 and updated since then, to prevent oil spills. Refineries and other facilities are required to have oil spill prevention or SPCC plans.\"The SPCC plan is already a requirement of their permits,\" Hrybyk said. \"So this is like giving Exxon back $1 million to do with as they please.\" The Bucket Brigade wants to take a look at Exxon's SPCCs. \"We filed a public records request with DEQ, and Exxon has 60 days from finalization of the settlement on Jan. 9 to submit its SPCC to DEQ under our request,\" she said. \"After that, I'm not sure how long it will take for us to get it.\"Jean Kelly, DEQ spokeswoman, said that under federal requirements existing SPCC plans at ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge complex contain procedures, methods, equipment and other ways to prevent oil discharges from non-transportation facilities into navigable waters. SPCC Regulation 40 CFR Part 112 requires such plans. \"The settlement agreement goes above and beyond this requirement by having ExxonMobil focus on its benzene storage tanks, since its spill occurred from a benzene storage tank, and to focus specifically on those tanks that contain greater that 20 percent benzene,\" she said. Kelly was referring to the company's June 14, 2012 benzene accident. Under the settlement, Exxon must improve benzene tank spill-detection and containment to reduce health and environmental risks, she said. The settlement's benzene-tank requirements exceed federal rules.\"But having an SPCC on file doesn't seem to do anything to prevent accidents at Exxon,\" Hrybyk said. \"The company's Baton Rouge complex has the highest accident rate of refineries and associated chemical plants in the state, and averaged almost two accidents per week in 2012. And that was only what they reported.\" ExxonMobil doesn't always tell the truth about its accidents, she said, pointing to the company's June 2012 benzene spill. \"According to DEQ's penalty worksheet for that violation, Exxon waited 52 hours before telling DEQ that over 31,000 pounds of benzene had leaked, not 10 pounds as the company initially reported.\"Moreover, \"the money allocated for the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Rebuilding Together isn't enough to improve environmental health in the area, given Exxon's frequent accidents,\" Hrybyk said. \"How can you weatherize homes with $100,000 for 59,000 people living within two miles of the plant? That small amount is an insult to people living near the facility whose homes are not air tight.\"Hrybyk said sheltering in place in less-than-air-tight homes is risky during leaks because chemicals seep into houses and become trapped there. \"Some of these chemicals are heavier than air, causing adverse health effects, and they are particularly dangerous for children,\" she said. When plants in Louisiana have accidents that emit chemicals, nearby residents are usually ordered to shelter at home. Authorities say that keeps them out of smoke and harm's way.In the settlement, Exxon also agreed to a $50,000 donation to the Baton Rouge Area Foundation for groundwater-conservation awareness in East Baton Rouge Parish; a $50,000 donation to DEQ to fund the agency's Expanded Age Distribution and Vehicle Population Data Project on emissions in Louisiana; a $29,000 donation to the Louisiana Foundation for Excellence in Science, Technology and Education, or LaFESTE, for the Baton Rouge Clean Air Coalition; a $25,000 donation to Baton Rouge Green Association Inc.'s NeighborWoods project near the refinery; and $25,000 payment to install a meteorological station at the company's Baton Rouge refinery complex.Cargile said the company's BEP payments must be made within 60 days after the finalized agreement on Jan. 9. \"The projects, of course, may take longer to implement,\" she said. \"The settlement outlines timelines in which the BEPs and projects will be completed.\"To read the settlement agreement and Exxon's Baton Rouge-area violations on the web, visit http://www.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/portals/0/enforcement/bep/pdf/ExxonMobil_Final.pdf"}, {"title": "How A Controversial Shark Culling Program Is Tearing Australia Apart", "text": "The Australian federal government is facing heavy criticism from both its constituents and the international community after it recently issued an exemption to environmental laws, thus clearing the way for a state-sponsored \"shark mitigation policy.\"In the past two years, six people have died from shark attacks in Western Australia's waters. Following the most recent fatality in November, the government decided to respond with a \"catch and kill\" policy to hopefully clear the waters at some of the most popular beach destinations. (Western Australia enjoys a $8.5 billion tourism industry.) According to the policy, commercial fishermen will set baited hooks a half mile offshore at various beaches from now until April 30. Any white shark, tiger shark or bull shark measuring over 3 meters (9.8 feet) that is caught by the hooks is to be \"humanely destroyed.\"Great white sharks are considered vulnerable in Australia and are typically protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act. But Australia's environment minister, Greg Hunt, issued the exemption (thus allowing the killings) because the recent increase in shark attack fatalities is \"well above the historic norm.\u201d Hunt argues that the policy is an appropriate response and in line with national interests.Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett, who pushed for the policy, has been quite vocal about his openness to culling. In Sept. 2012, Barnett told reporters, \"We will always put the lives and safety of beachgoers ahead of the shark. This is, after all, a fish -- let's keep it in perspective.\"Not everyone agrees. Earlier this month, thousands of protesters rallied at a Perth beach to express their opposition. Various Facebook pages call for boycotting and picketing whichever fishing businesses are involved in the policy and some have sworn to dismantle the fishing lines. Public ire has grown so fierce that the policy's implementation has even been delayed after the fishing companies contracted to set the lines received death threats and backed out.Humane Society International called the policy a \"complete disgrace\" and a \"farce,\" arguing that shark culling isn't proven to reduce human fatalities. \u201cThe proposed policy and consideration by the federal environment minister lacks any real scientific approach, and fails to sufficiently consider the wider marine implications of the program,\" Alexia Wellbelove, a senior program manager at the conservation group, said.Opponents are also drawing attention to the indiscriminate nature of the lines, which could attract turtles, dolphins, or other fish. \"When you have dead animals hanging on the line,\" Shark biologist Ryan Kempster said, \"this attracts in more so essentially you're attracting more animals to the area.\" (Including sharks.)Perhaps most surprising is that Western Australia was recently lauded in the international press for an innovative program whereby transmitters on sharks automatically sent out tweets to subscribers when tagged sharks swam too close to shore. Surf Life Saving Western Australia, a community service association, had transmitters implanted in more than 320 sharks, and the program was hailed as an effective and humane way to avoid shark attacks.Even if you're not opposed to the shark culling program, beach-goers in Western Australia might want to follow the tweets as an extra precaution. Pam Allen, a campaigner for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, reminded folks that one shark caught on the lines clears the way for another to swim inland.\"These are freak, random events that depend on so many factors,\" she said. \"Just because you catch one shark at a drum line, it doesn't mean another one won't come in.\""}, {"title": "Three Men Charged For Setting Off California Wildfire", "text": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Three men were charged in federal court on Tuesday with setting an illegal campfire that ignited a blaze which has since grown to nearly 2,000 acres in the foothills near Los Angeles, but is largely under control.Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, Jonathan Carl Jarrell, 24, and Clifford Eugene Henry Jr, 22, were arrested on Thursday shortly after the fire broke out in the Angeles National Forest north of the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora.They were escaping the flames when they were taken into custody by Glendora police.

They face charges in U.S. court because the Angeles National Forest, where the blaze broke out, is federal land.They are due to appear in court on Wednesday for an arraignment. The three men told police and arson investigators that together they started a campfire and wind blew burning paper into the brush, igniting what authorities would later call the Colby Fire, prosecutors said.The place where the three men started the campfire is not designated for camping, Glendora police have said. The area had at the time been under a red flag warning, which is an advisory from the National Weather Service that says dry conditions are ripe for a wildfire to break out.The Colby Fire has burned 1,952 acres (790 hectares) and is almost entirely contained, after having destroyed five homes, authorities said on the Incident Information System, a government website for tracking wildfires. About 300 firefighters are still deployed against the blaze.

Focused always on naval warfare or world trade or emigration, the official narratives have omitted accounts of involuntary transfer of humans from one place to another, indeed, the awful fact of humans as trade goods, as an unspoken part of the official interpretation of a national history. The tide turned in the late 1990s when the first major exhibition on the international slave trade opened at the Maritime Museum in Liverpool, England, followed shortly by similar presentations at the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City and the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia. That progress has continued; last year, a powerful exhibition on the Dutch contribution to the slave trade opened at the National Maritime Museum of the Netherlands in Amsterdam.The facts are evident, and the extent of the 19th century slave phenomenon was worldwide. UNESCO, the United Nations organization that documents and preserves cultural themes and places, has an extensive interpretive schematic of the many sites and cities around the world where the trafficking of humans was practiced, where thousands, indeed millions, of individuals were assembled, sold, and transferred to new owners in faraway places as chattel and cheap labor.This tragic story can never be told often enough in my opinion, nor can we deny its impact, in the United States most dramatically, as an integrating process that brought extraordinary cultural value to our nation, even as it brought the seeds of prejudice and violence that distress us to this day. On the one hand, our demography, language, song, and values have been profoundly influenced by the cultural contributions from Africa; on the other, we fought a terrible resultant war, have known bigotry and segregation, and have perpetuated other more subtle manifestations of race division and conflict. That story continues.Human trafficking can also be viewed through the economic perspective. Slaves provide services at a fraction of the cost of paid labor, and the financial incentive for such services explains even today the reality of enforced employment of children, the comparative inequality of pay for workers in the developing world, and even in the trafficking of women as sex workers, a trade that, sadly, continues to the present.Boat people are another example. Typically, they are fleeing a social or political tyranny at home, in search of alternative opportunity, however ephemeral, in a place distant but attracting by virtue of its reputed opportunities and freedoms. More and more, we are aware of such passages in Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. We hear the extreme stories, when the boats founder or the container full of miserable human cargo is discovered. We don't hear the less sensational, but equally disturbing, accounts of such passages when the migrants succeed in reaching shore, only to thereafter disappear into the anonymity of urban poverty, unemployment, and abuse in a new place, not what was meant to be and inhabited by strangers.When we assert that the ocean has been, and will continue to be, a place of global connection, we also accept that the sea serves all forms of exchange - whether it be the transfer of arms, nuclear waste, oil or chemicals, raw materials or manufactured goods, or human beings - men, women, and children, seeking hospitality for their hopes and dreams, often finding instead in-hospitality, exploitation, and disappointment. The ocean is never really neutral or benign; even at its most placid, it is nonetheless alive, authentic, and changing. It is a natural scape for human endeavor, but it remains for the most part outside our vision and behavior, a place apart.But beyond that horizon, real life abounds - in the congruities and conflicts of the creatures in the ocean, and those who sail upon it. We should be aware of that vivid continuing drama, its actualities and outcomes. We should know the true value of what passes across the oceans, the precious cargo of goods, people, and ideas that have as been for all time the essential maritime story. Ocean traffic takes many forms; we should understand them all, and pay attention."}, {"title": "Colorado Skier Records Himself Surviving An Avalanche, Scares The Hell Out Of Us", "text": "A Colorado backcountry skier survived an avalanche that he accidentally triggered on Saturday and captured the whole thing on his helmet-mounted camera.Lance Light, the skier depicted in the video above, told Denver's CBS4 that he and a friend were backcountry skiing at Colorado's Berthoud Pass, a mountain pass in the Colorado Rockies about an hour outside of Denver.

It's a party where there are lots of beautifully wrapped packages, but the gifts are all stinkers.That's what the Keystone XL Pipeline is for Montana and for our country: a bad deal wrapped in pretty packaging. After researching the issue and speaking with Montanans from all over the state, here are my top 10 reasons for opposing it.Who am I? I'm a Montana rancher and Democrat who wants to be the next U.S. senator from Montana. (Find out more about my campaign here, if you're curious.) I'm the dark horse running for the open seat to replace Max Baucus, and I'm the only candidate -- Democrat or Republican -- who's daring to come out against this boondoggle.10. TransCanada is a bad neighbor; they won't respect our property rights or our land. Ranchers and local officials in Eastern Montana, who are near the Bakken Shale oil and gas development, report damaging practices by TransCanada, including allegedly driving big trucks over pastures without permission, hiding behind other companies to avoid responsibility, and aggressively using threats of eminent domain seizures to pressure landowners to sell. When the first leg of the Keystone XL pipeline came to Nebraska, TransCanada's threats were bad enough that even their good buddy Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Tar Sands) had to beg TransCanada to stop.9. The steel for Keystone XL has already been made, much of it in Canada, India, and Italy. No new jobs for Montanans there! NBC News did a special investigation into the job claims made for the Keystone XL project and found that \"they don't hold up.\" NBC News cited a report by Cornell University Global Labor Institute that found that \"some 50 percent or more of the steel pipe used for Keystone XL ... will be manufactured outside of the U.S.\"8. People in eastern Montana communities impacted by the Bakken development are unhappy with the impact on their infrastructure. A report commissioned by the Montana Crime Control Board found that while a few people may get rich, the rest of the community has had to deal with housing shortages and school overcrowding, as well as roads, gas stations, sewers, and medical and fire services that have not been able to keep up with the growth. Everywhere in Montana, I meet the same concerns. If we can't even take care of our people who are dealing with the impacts of energy development now, what in the world makes us think we can handle a pipeline in the right way for Montanans?7. Keystone XL will increase the cost of crude oil here in Montana, narrowing profits for Montana businesses like the Billings Refinery. When it was applying for a permit from the Canadian Energy Board, TransCanada admitted that Keystone XL would raise the price of crude by $3 a barrel. Montana refineries have been getting a discount on Canadian oil because of how hard it is to deliver, but that discount would be eliminated if the Keystone XL pipeline is built.6. Keystone XL carries permanent risk to our planet. Climate change affects all of us and would be truly disastrous if it comes to pass. Developing the Alberta Tar Sands will result in a sharp increase in greenhouse gas emissions that the world can't afford. The increased pollution from the tar sands oil would be as much as adding more than 37 million cars or 51 new coal plants. That's a dirty deal for our state and our planet.5. Speaking of jobs, jobs, jobs, TransCanada has been doing \"fuzzy math\" on the number of jobs it will create, counting each year as one job, and including jobs like ballet dancing and speech therapy in the potential job count. When TransCanada does hire, they have a history of skipping local workers and bringing in their own people: only three South Dakotan welders and pipefitters worked on the pipeline in South Dakota. The more you look, the more it's clear that the only permanent jobs Montana would see from this pipeline would be for cleanup crews on the Yellowstone River when the pipeline pollutes it.4. Keystone XL will drive up gas prices for consumers from my state of Montana all the way to Tennessee. Because this entire region is dependent on Canadian crude for their gasoline, and some of that crude oil will now be shipped overseas, the law of supply and demand tells us that now prices will go up. Consumer Watchdog put this increase to gas prices at 20 to 40 cents per gallon.3. Even Continental Resources doesn't think Keystone XL is necessary. They are an oil company that had previously committed to shipping crude through the pipeline. Continental CEO Harold Hamm said that the entire oil industry is no longer counting on Keystone XL after years of delays over environmental concerns.2. Keystone XL threatens permanent risk to our land. It's not a matter of whether it'll spill but of when. Keystone I, the first leg of the pipeline, sprang 12 leaks in its first year of operation, spewing over 20,000 gallons of crude oil in North Dakota and Kansas and demonstrating that safety regulations for tar sands pipelines are completely inadequate. TransCanada says that its pipelines are \"state of the art\" and predicted that they would only spill once every 12 years. Montana can't risk repeatedly dumping heavy crude all over our land, livelihood and legacy.1. We can do better. Let's invest in projects that create permanent jobs and help Montanans live in a better world.There are 10 reasons that I'm against Keystone XL, but there's one big reason that I'm the only Montana U.S. Senate candidate standing up against the pipeline. There's a lot of pressure on politicians to smile when they get their \"White Elephant\" presents and not look too closely at what's inside. Politicians are pushing the pipeline with one hand, and with the other they're refusing to support the communities that are already affected by energy development. Montanans have had enough.

If just 10 percent of Chinese families who make more than $16,000 per year buy one two-ounce ivory carving -- about the size of a piece of hotel soap -- 32,600 elephants must die. Poachers are expanding their market opportunities and are now even hacking off elephants' toenails for new \"traditional\" medicine cures.Remains of one of over two dozen African forest elephants killed at the Dzanga Bai clearing in the Central African Republic last May. Photo: \u00a9 Mike Fay/WCSRaising awareness about the plight of elephants is without doubt necessary. It has galvanized Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her daughter the Vice-Chair of the Clinton Foundation to mobilize support from presidents of elephant range states to take concrete action to halt the slaughter of elephants for their ivory. It convinced President Obama to issue an Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking and establish an highly influential Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking. Most recently it has prodded the European Parliament to call for a moratorium on all ivory sales within the EU.But alone it will never be sufficient to halt the slaughter.We have credible evidence that where national park rangers and community ecoguards are out patrolling, and risking their lives doing so, elephants have a much greater chance of escaping the poacher's bullet, axe and chainsaw.That is the good news.But unless we tackle the trafficking networks and consumer demand, elephants will never be safe from the slaughter driven by a desire to own ivory and for the perceived prestige owned ivory confers. Enforcing the law is a start but preventing crime is better, because catching poachers with ivory does not help the elephant who died.A portion of the approximately six tons of confiscated ivory crushed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service last November in Denver. Photo: \u00a9 Julie Larsen Maher/WCS.So what disincentives can we muster to curb the trade and prevent the death of the next elephant?Great work by the conservation community is confirming our suspicion that the trade in ivory is no longer driven by poor hunters who see poaching as a quick, albeit risky, way out of poverty. It is now largely capitalized by criminal gangs - the same gangs that traffic in drugs, weapons, and human slaves. Ivory is just one more commodity in a global criminal enterprise.So how do we take down these criminals? We could do worse than look to Eliot Ness, a late 1920s agent in the US Treasury Department's Bureau of Prohibition.Between 1927 and 1931 Ness and his team of \"Untouchables\" tried to bring down Chicago gangster Al Capone by seizing illegal breweries and disrupting booze distribution routes from Canada. But what finally stopped Capone was the Treasury Department's Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service), whose evidence resulted in the conviction of Capone for tax evasion. In other words: they followed the money.The US has in place several very effective agencies charged with following and seizing illicit cash from individuals or groups suspected of criminal activity. As part of the United States' effort to halt international terrorism, the illegal drug trade, and human trafficking, government agencies are actively involved with their international partners in enforcing United States Code Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 95, \u00a71956 - Laundering of monetary instruments.Several U.S. government entities - from the Departments of Justice (Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section) and Treasury (Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence) to Homeland Security (Project STAMP - Smuggler and Trafficker Assets, Monies and Proceeds) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Trade Transparency Unit) - have the staff and experience needed to detect and seize illicit flows of ivory and other illegally traded wildlife.U.S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness. Photo: U.S. Treasury DepartmentBecause the criminal gangs that finance the ivory trade work in cash, they must move and \"wash\" millions of dollars of illicit money. Using money laundering statutes to follow the money and seize illicit funds is a potentially powerful additional way to curb wildlife trafficking.If the US can bottle up the assets of traffickers, they will have fewer resources to finance the illegal trade. Their ability to pay the poacher, bribe the police, smuggle the ivory, and buy-off the customs officials become degraded. Over time, they may decide to get out of the ivory trafficking business because it becomes not worth the cost of forfeiting their assets.Indeed, by taking a page from Eliot Ness elephant poachers and the thousands of other participants in the illegal wildlife trade might become just a little less untouchable."}, {"title": "Expanding Access to Energy Will Strengthen Africa's Human Capacity and Economic Growth", "text": "Each and every day throughout sub-Saharan Africa, some 600 million people - or two-thirds of the region's population - are still living without access to electricity and other modern energy services.

In remote, rural communities across the continent, a majority of families are still cooking their daily meals and heating their homes with wood, coal, charcoal, and animal waste. By nightfall, these communities are completely covered in darkness.The human cost of work productivity due to the lack of access to electricity cannot be underestimated. Africa will continue to lag behind other continents in global competitiveness and economic growth if its population lacks adequate access to power, threatening any significant economic progress.The lack of access to energy significantly impacts African young professionals. For AAI, our core mission is to advance higher education and professional development training for Africans. Today, young people in Africa make up nearly 40 percent of the working age population, yet 60 percent are unemployed. The McKinsey Global Institute Report estimates that Africa will add 122 million to its labor force between 2010 and 2020, creating a labor force of more than 500 million across the continent.Increasing energy access has the potential to boost sustainable development and growth as well as build human capital on the African continent. Simply put, energy access allows people to live a better life. Without electricity, entrepreneurs are not able to gain access to market information and technologies to expand their businesses; worker productivity and health care markedly drop without health care clinics and hospitals equipped with modern medical technologies and services; and schools are not able to prepare students for a knowledge-based economy.Launched in June 2013, President Barack Obama's \"Power Africa\" hopes to bring reliable, sustainable energy to millions in sub-Saharan Africa by addressing gaps in the continent's energy sector. The new U.S. initiative will commit $7 billion over the next five years to support the energy needs of six African countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, and Tanzania.Accelerating access to energy, particularly clean, renewable resources such as wind, water, the sun, and biomass among others, is a win-win in building human capital on the continent: it reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change for a healthier population, while promoting Africa's work productivity and economic growth.The \"Power Africa\" initiative has the potential to make an enormous difference in the lives of millions of Africans. Collectively, the private and public sectors must work together to strengthen Africa's technical infrastructure to expand access to energy, leading to greater opportunities and job creation on the African continent."}, {"title": "Dolphins Crash California Surf Competition, Show Competitors How It's Done", "text": "Surfing, it can be argued, was invented by dolphins, and every now and then, the majestic, fun-loving mammals decide to remind us lowly bipeds that they still reign supreme when it comes to catching waves.This past weekend, a pod of dolphins crashed the Rincon Classic surfing competition in Ventura County, Calif., totally stealing the show and proving their superiority.

Too often, in the interest of preventing panic or confusion, government agencies clamp down on their communication with the news media and the public. As happened in this case, a parsimonious public-affairs strategy all too often backfires, feeding people's fear and distrust of government.

To do this, we must redefine the environmental conversation in the U.S. If we don't, we may not succeed. Our well-intended efforts could become futile.We live in a society that has become increasingly polarized, where political ideology trumps common sense, where neighbors cannot see eye-to-eye on important issues because of their stubborn subscription to a particular set of views.Environmental organizations, like mine, Rock the Earth, must also contend with trying to convey an honest message about the importance of protecting awe-inspiring places to an audience distracted by a tornado of lies, deeply funded spin machines churning out mountains of disinformation, a cacophony of noise designed to distract and confuse.  There is no question that we can fight back with facts. Scientists have published innumerable studies detailing the tragedies of toxic air and water on our health, the loss of pristine land because of haphazard development, and poorly planned resource extraction. Let us not forget the well-documented specter of climate change.We can cite numerous studies to support our positions. But this approach often falls on deaf ears.Why? Science and facts can be too dispassionate, not enough to excite a mass movement for change, an awakening to the reality of the dangers confronting our planet.For example, in the media, stories focused on a two-degree rise in the global temperature average has a way of making eyes glaze over, rather than forming a deep impact on our hearts and our emotions -- the motivators that make us want to do great things. It is too abstract, devoid of touch and feeling. Surely, it must be part of our message, but, we can't afford to hang our hats completely on that approach much longer.The doom and gloom headlines create another barrier. Now we have to overcome a mountain of hopelessness, a narrative of futility where maybe we should just throw up our hands and surrender.Facts and science do have a place. In court, Rock the Earth cites well thought out studies to outwit corporations and governments. We have prevailed in several cases - such as protecting the Roan Plateau in Colorado - because of bone-dry science.But, this is a courtroom. In the court of public opinion, this approach will have limited success to energize more people to take action for our causes.We need to reinvent the public environmental conversation so that we can open eyes to the realities of today's challenges. We must reach, teach and influence a larger audience - or we fail.We have to develop approaches that profoundly appeal to the heart, one of my motivations in forming Rock the Earth in 2002, a Denver-based nonprofit.I realized that one of the best forums to reach common ground with anyone, no matter your political bent, is at a concert where ideologies recede into the shadows, where we can form a common bond among each other under the enchantment of a night of great music.The drum beat or a wild guitar riff, has a way of breaking down barriers, freeing our minds, and letting ourselves go - even just for a few hours. The heart takes over. We leave our roles, leave behind our preconceived notions, and take part in a profoundly human experience, together.  In 2013, Rock the Earth volunteers conducted environmental education, outreach, and citizen activation at 250 U.S. concert dates. Over the years, we have been able to reach millions of music fans and talk to them about environmental issues that they may never heard of and often inspired them to take action.We have no barriers here, no cacophony of disinformation to battle against. We can more easily reach their hearts, turning people onto environmentalism that never lent it any credence perhaps because of preconceived notions or political brainwashing.And, we are able to make that connection with the help of music, which has a way of inciting the higher ideals in all of us.We have partnered with musicians like The Dave Matthews Band, Wilco, Bonnie Raitt, The Allman Brothers Band, Jack Johnson, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.Musicians have a long history of aligning themselves to progressive causes. They are not just actors on a stage playing music. They are real people with real views, often allied with our causes. They espouse their thoughts to their fans - numbering in the millions. When they share our message, we all win.The bottom line is that we must get more people to at least listen. To do this, we must invent creative approaches that appeal to both the heart and mind. And, we have to search for venues that promote a sense of common ground.We need to be more daring and find our own drum beat for change. We must develop new approaches to break through the mountain of hopelessness. I challenge us to do so."}, {"title": "West Virginia Gov.

These horrible dolphin hunts were revealed to the world (including most Japanese) by the Academy Award-winning documentary, The Cove.One of these dolphins is a small calf that we have named Angel. Angel is completely white with pink eyes, a true albino, and was herded into the Cove with its mother. Our volunteer Earth Island Cove Monitor Karla Sanjur was there and her report and photos can be found here.Karla described the baby dolphin as looking like an angel with fins. It was brutally taken from its mother and put on display in the Taiji Whale Museum, which subsidizes the dolphin slaughter by paying top dollar for a handful of captive dolphins. These dolphins never see the ocean again, much less their mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers. Those unfortunate dolphins left behind, including Angel's mother, will be killed in a welter of blood for meat in Japanese markets, despite the fact that the meat is contaminated with dangerous levels of the neurotoxin mercury.Worldwide condemnation of the dolphin drive hunts continues to grow. US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy released an unprecedented public statement of concern over the Taiji kill. And Japanese artist and activist Yoko Ono published a powerful open letter to people of Taiji calling for an end to the dolphin killing to avoid \"making the children of the world hate the Japanese\".One of Japan's foremost defenders of the dolphins, our colleague Sakae Hemmi of the Elsa Nature Conservancy of Japan, submitted a letter a few weeks ago to Dr. Gerald Dick, Executive Director of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), which includes as a member the Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA), one of whose members is Angel's captor, the Taiji Whale Museum.Dr. Dick responded to Elsa stating that WAZA would not take action against the hunts: \"As you know, in some Japanese communities these drives have been part of the culture for centuries.\"This is nonsense, and Ms. Hemmi has replied to Dr. Dick with an open letter stating that: \"In fact, the history of dolphin hunting in Taiji is short. According to The History of Taiji, edited and published by Taiji town in 1979, the first recorded dolphin drive was in 1933, with subsequent hunts occurring in 1936 and 1944. It was not until 1969 that dolphin drives have been conducted on a large scale. The history of the dolphin drives spans not so-called 400 years, but a mere 45. Furthermore, in 1969, the main goal of the dolphin drive was to capture pilot whales as prized showpieces for the Taiji Whale Museum. In other words, the dolphin drive was purely for profit, having nothing to do with cultural history.\"Elsa and two other grassroots Japanese environmental organizations are asking WAZA, in their open letter, to eject JAZA members that violate the WAZA \"Code of Ethics\" in using the brutal hunts to catch dolphins for display, thereby subsidizing the slaughter of dolphins for meat.What is going on here? The dolphin hunts are being used by the captivity industry to supply wild dolphins to aquariums in Japan, China, Dubai, and other aquariums all around the world. (Imports of dolphins from Taiji into the US were finally blocked by the efforts of Earth Island Institute and other organizations in 1993.)WAZA publishes a \"Code of Ethics\" and has given lip service to opposing the Taiji drive hunts. But JAZA and the Taiji Whale Museum are still members in good standing with WAZA.What kind of ethics condemns the dolphin hunts while taking advantage of them to help the Taiji dolphin hunters round up and slaughter hundreds of dolphins every year?It is time for the dolphin captivity industry and WAZA to become part of the solution for dolphins and whales instead of a major source of the problem. As the documentaries The Cove, A Fall from Freedom, Blood Dolphin$, and Blackfish make plain, intelligent dolphins and whales like orcas and beluga, do not belong in small concrete tanks, separated from the two most important things in their lives: their families and their freedom of the oceans.WAZA should stop making claims based on the false assertion that the dolphin hunts are somehow part of \"Japanese culture.\" This is just a lame excuse for the lucrative captures and killing to continue.Instead WAZA and ALL its members should be condemning the dolphin hunts in no uncertain terms. If JAZA members continue to acquire dolphins from the drive hunts in Taiji, JAZA should be expelled from WAZA.Dr. Dick should join Karla and me in Taiji to see for himself what his captive industry is doing to dolphins and small whales.Unlike Angel and other dolphins in captivity, WAZA has the freedom to make a choice on how to act. So far, Dr. Dick and WAZA have made the wrong choice and that is shameful."}, {"title": "Problems Persist After Smithfield Sells Out to Shuanghui; Future Remains Uncertain", "text": "Swine confinement barns and a lagoon that holds swine urine, excrement and other facility waste produced at the Stilley Facility - a swine confinement operation that confines more that 11,000 hogs.On Tuesday, January 14th, the Neuse Riverkeeper Foundation and Waterkeeper Alliance issued a Notice of Intent to sue the current and former owners and operators of the Stilley swine feeding operation, located near Trenton, North Carolina, to stop pollution caused by illegal waste disposal. The Stilley Facility confines more than 11,000 hogs for Murphy Brown, LLC. - a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc. - in the Neuse River Basin. The state has repeatedly documented violations at the Stilley Facility, but has not taken action necessary to stop discharges of swine waste or issued it a Clean Water Act (CWA) permit as required by federal law. Frustrated by government inaction, we stepped in to perform our own investigation and confirmed that the Stilley Facility continues to discharge swine waste into public waters that flow to the Trent River, and ultimately, the Neuse Estuary. We are seeking to work cooperatively with the facility to stop illegal swine waste discharges, and, if this is not successful, will file a CWA citizen suit to stop these illegal discharges of swine waste. The goal of this action, and others we are taking in partnership with the Neuse River Foundation, is restoration of the Neuse River Basin, which serves over a million citizens.Not long ago, there were approximately 22,000 traditional family farmers raising 2,000,000 hogs in North Carolina. Beginning around 1987, nearly all of those farms began to be replaced with industrial swine \"feeding operations\" producing approximately 10,000,000 hogs in factory-style confinement facilities - primarily in North Carolina's vulnerable coastal plain. Since the advent of industrialized meat production, North Carolina has experienced both catastrophic and persistent pollution of its valuable coastal waters. After nearly two decades of pollution control efforts in the Neuse River Basin, the state reports that its efforts have not \"achieved any significant decrease in actual nutrient loading,\" and the area is still plagued by recurrent algal blooms and massive fish kills that have serious negative ramifications for the economy, recreational use of the water and the livelihoods of local residents. More than a billion fish are believed to have died in the Neuse alone since the swine industry began operations. Although industrialized animal feeding operations are not the only source of pollution, they are a major source - there are an estimated 500 swine facilities in the Neuse alone - and, unlike other significant sources, discharges from these facilities are not addressed by North Carolina's pollution control plan.Illegal discharges of phosphorus and nitrogen from swine feeding operations and other sources in the Neuse River watershed are contributing to fish kills. Dead fish are pictured here along the shore of the Neuse River near Carolina Pines in 2012.While the Stilley Facility owners and operators are responsible for operating in compliance with the CWA, hiding behind the shield of a contract is a multi-national corporation that owns the animals and oversees operation of the facility but wipes its hands of responsibility for the waste left behind by its hogs. Hong Kong-based Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., backed by international investment firms and a Singapore state-owned company, recently acquired Smithfield Foods, Inc. - a corporation valued at $7.1 billion - to become the largest pork producer in the world. Shuanghui now owns most of the hogs and huge tracts of land in North Carolina, as well as the world's largest swine slaughterhouse - slaughtering around 35,000 hogs every day - in Tar Heel, North Carolina. Shuanghui also acquired Smithfield's business model and contracts with North Carolina growers, which attempt to eliminate corporate liability for pollution caused by its swine production business.In North Carolina, swine confinement and feeding facilities store massive amounts of raw feces and urine in open, antiquated pits that can pollute the groundwater. Moreover, as the pits fill up, the foul smelling waste, which can contain high levels of pathogens, nutrients and other pollutants, is often sprayed onto ditched fields which can rapidly transport the waste into nearby streams and rivers. Poor waste disposal practices and widespread water pollution by the hog industry are well documented, but technologies are available to stop these practices and the resulting pollution.In 2000, Smithfield entered into an agreement with the North Carolina Attorney General to fund development of environmentally superior waste management technologies for swine facilities. Several technologies were developed that practically eliminated the waste stream, but $17.1 million later, Smithfield declared the systems were not \"economically feasible,\" and no further action has been taken to implement clean technologies. North Carolina has banned the use of lagoons and sprayfields at new facilities, but thousands of these systems remain. As this multi-national corporation takes the reins, it is time for our government to compel the phase-out of all existing swine waste lagoons. The cost for implementing the new technologies should be picked up by Shuanghui, which benefits from U.S. government subsidies, earns huge profits, and currently takes no responsibility over the waste produced by their swine at contract facilities.Acquisitions like the Shuanghui-Smithfield purchase typically subject local economies to foreign market demands and investors' financial motivations, often resulting in natural resource depletion, pollution, increased unemployment, poverty, and income declines. Based on these factors, the future looks grim for any hope of change in Smithfield's practices as a result of this acquisition. It is time for Shuanghui to prove that it can be part of the solution - showing the world that a multi-national corporation can be socially responsible and invest in the health of the communities that it thrives on. This is Shuangui's opportunity to invest in superior technologies, assist its North Carolina contractors with the burdens of waste disposal, and stop polluting North Carolina's water resources.The problems at the Stilley Facility provide an excellent opportunity for Shaunghui to step in and help its contract growers comply with the CWA. This is the first case in North Carolina against a Smithfield-contracted hog facility since the Shuanghui acquisition. Will Shuanghui stand up to the challenge and lead this industry into a clean future? Only time will tell - but the clock is ticking!"}, {"title": "California Wildfire Now Almost Contained With Help From Above (VIDEO)", "text": "The Colby Fire broke out at approximately 6 a.m. on Jan. 16, and blazed through Glendora and Azusa in east Los Angeles, but is fortunately 95 percent contained as of Tuesday.The fire was allegedly started by three men in their 20s whose illegal campfire got out of control.

Spain became the first country ever to get more energy from wind than any other source during a complete year in 2013, with a 21.1-percent share at 55 gigawatts (GW). According to Spain's Wind Energy Association, at the end of 2013, this clean energy was able to bring the price of electricity from $150 per megawatt (MW)/hour down to $7 per MV/hour.And in December, Denmark became the first country ever to generate more than half of its energy from wind, a total of 54.8 percent. Specifically, on December 21, wind fulfilled that country's entire energy demand, and over the course of the year, it produced one third of the consumed total.The good news also abounds here at home. In Texas, during the extreme cold spell that gripped almost the entire country during the first week of the year, wind energy saved the day for a grid that was overwhelmed by demand. On January 7, when several power plants shut down, wind energy from Western Texas avoided dangerous blackouts throughout the state. This is the logical result of Texas having added more wind energy to the grid than any other state.And throughout the U.S., the breeze of good news has become a veritable gale. In 2012, the country's wind energy capacity surpassed 60 GV (enough to power 15 million homes), no other country installed more wind energy than the U.S., and wind added more power to the national grid than any other source, including natural gas.It's no wonder then that the price of wind power is hitting record lows: 4 cents per KW/hour, 50 percent less than in 2009. It's no wonder also that the utility owned by Warren Buffett has invested $1 billion to purchase enough wind turbines in Iowa to generate 1,000 MW.The price of the alternative to clean energy, on the other hand, is simply unacceptable. According to a Harvard University study, every year the costs of coal pollution -- also known as externalities -- hit $500 billion (one 5 followed by 11 zeros), in premature deaths, asthma, emphysema, heart disease, cancer and other factors. Big Coal pays nothing out of this huge price tag. They instead dump it on you, me and the rest of the country.Considering these arguments, it's simply astonishing that Congress still is to renew the Production Tax Credit (PTC), one of the several tax incentives that invest in job creation in the clean energy industry. Just wind supports 80,000 jobs in the U.S., and 72 percent of the equipment needed to build wind turbines is manufactured in our country.The fossil fuel industry, on the other hand, calls the U.S. Capitol home. Each year, oil, coal and gas companies receive up to $52 billion in subsidies; that is, a gift from the taxpayer, you, me and everyone else.Tell Congress that renewing the PTC is crucial for the wind industry to continue its smooth sailing.Javier Sierra is a Sierra Club columnist."}, {"title": "Maryland Lawmakers May Finally Realize That You Shouldn't Discriminate Against Pit Bulls", "text": "Who's a good legislature? You are, Maryland!This week, Maryland's General Assembly is holding a hearing on a piece of legislation that would undo a controversial court ruling which has made life very hard for Free State pit bull owners.In 2012, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in Tracey v. Solesky that pit bulls and pit bull mixes are \"inherently dangerous,\" and that not only are these dogs' owners \"strictly liable\" for any attacks, but so are the owners' landlords.This means that pit bulls are presumed to be dangerous, even if the dogs haven't previously shown any dangerous propensities. Owners of other dogs -- dogs that aren't pit bulls or pit bull mixes -- are only liable if they knew or should have known that their dogs are dangerous. Similarly, landlords aren't usually liable for their tenants' dogs, unless the landlord knew or should have known that the dogs presented an unusual risk of harm.The ruling has been lambasted both for its substance -- even President Obama says there is no evidence that pit bulls are in fact more dangerous than any other dogs -- and for what the ruling has meant for Maryland families.Here's the rescue group Best Friends Animal Society's take:The effect of that ruling was to spur a rash of evictions and the surrender of pit bulls to shelters with little chance of adoption given the liability issue for pet owners and landlords, not to mention problems related to homeowners insurance, etc. Such breed-discriminatory legislation does not advance public safety because it separates legal consequences and liability from the behavior of individual dogs and reckless owner practices.\u201cEvery day I wake up and I wonder whether this will be the last day. Someone might say you can no longer keep your dog,\u201d one dog owner, Danielle Windsor, told Baltimore's CBS affiliate. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\u201d\"Here\" is Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, where last week folks who oppose the court ruling were showing support for HB 0073, a bill that would undo the court's 2012 pit bull ruling.Best Friends summed up the bill in a blog post supporting the proposed legislation, introduced by Del. Luiz R.S. Simmons (D-Montgomery):HB 73 would rightly make dog owners, not landlords, responsible for personal injuries or death caused by their dogs. It would also protect responsible dog owners by creating a rebuttable presumption (to indicate that the owner thought the dog was a good dog: for example, he went to obedience classes, does well in doggie daycare, behaves nicely at the groomer).The hearing on this bill will be held on Thursday. A hearing on companion legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. Brian E. Frosh (D-Montgomery) is scheduled for early February.Last session, legislation to undo the pit bull ruling failed in the Maryland General Assembly. And some in the animal rescue community aren't wagging their tails over the bill now under consideration -- for example, attorney E. Anne Benaroya, director of the Maryland Animal Law Center, tells HuffPost that it \"does absolutely zero except make every dog-owner potentially liable, thereby generating a new cottage industry\" among personal injury lawyers.But many pit bull advocates are pushing for this bill's passage. And Tami Santelli, Maryland state director for the Humane Society of the United States, tells HuffPost she's optimistic it might go through, this time around.\"The legislation proposed by Sen. Frosh and Del. Simmons is a reasonable compromise that is fair for victims of dog bites and for dog owners. It removes the breed specific policy established in Tracey v. Solesky but raises the bar for all dog owners, regardless of the breed of their dog,\" she says. \"This compromise has been worked out by leaders in the House and Senate, so we are hopeful that the General Assembly will pass it quickly and provide relief to the thousands of Marylanders impacted by this ruling.\"Need more convincing that the Maryland Court of Appeals needs a smack on the nose?

For example, Ashdown recounted times when management required a sick whale to perform in shows, claiming \"if we treat her as if she is sick, then she will start acting sick\" -- even if she was not eating or socializing with other whales.On the other hand, Zimmermann elaborated on SeaWorld's profitability from the killer whales, noting that they're \"central\" to their operations. He also estimated that even though SeaWorld does a fair bit of marine mammal rehabilitation, they only spend about \"0.0006 percent\" of their profit on rescues and rehabilitation -- and some of those rescues turn into performers. \"If the argument is 'well we do some good stuff, so it's okay if we do some bad stuff,' that's not a very good argument to make,\" he told HuffPost Live.Be sure to also check out HuffPost Live's interview with \"Blackfish's\" director from this past summer."}, {"title": "Where's the Fire?

Our warming planet now has an open Arctic \"freezer door,\" causing the jet stream to whip wildly north and south like a wounded snake, disrupting Earth's normal cycles. And of course this extreme climate situation is only one of many we've experienced in the last few years.And yet most of us continue with Business As Usual.For example, last weekend I attended a two day psychology workshop on treating trauma where the actually-happening-right-here-right-now trauma of the destruction of nature and our collective life support systems was never mentioned. It's so much easier and more comfortable to talk about our clients' childhood pain and ignore what's actually happening to us and our children and grandchildren. Environmental trauma? We don't want to talk about that.There are so few places I can speak openly about my grief, rage and alarm at the crimes that are really going on -- not long ago in our childhoods but here on this planet today, getting worse every year. And when I do mention the C words -- climate and collapse -- in public or even with friends and relatives, I am often met with embarrassed silence or blank stares. Why would she want to talk about such an upsetting subject? Few of us care to look our collective apocalypse in the face.So my question is Where's the Fire? Our homeland is burning up, our animal siblings are dying all around us, and our own lives and the survival and wellbeing of our kids and grandkids are more at risk every day. Yet even though increasing percentages of our population are now aware of the enormity of the danger -- especially young people -- the silence continues. Let's talk about something else. Let's focus on day to day life. Let's not talk about it.So Where's the Fire?Here's where I feel the heat: among those who deny climate change. If I bring this topic up among people who believe the scientists are lying about what's happening, I get plenty of fire and passion! But if I raise the issue among those who agree that science is telling us something important, I find a kind of weird emotional numbness or disconnection. \"Yes, we know all about that,\" they say. \"We really should do something. But what can we do? The politicians or the government really should address this but of course they won't. And what I'm really concerned about is (fill in the blanks here: my job, my friends and family, my bank account, having fun, the Academy Awards, Miley Cyrus... ) Or \"I just can't think about it\" or \"it's just too upsetting\" or \"it's politics and I just can't get involved\" or \"What can I do?\"Merely raising the subject -- even among people of good will -- too often feels like breaking a taboo against a forbidden, even embarrassing topic. Because this is a HOT issue and one we're still not really ready to address in proportion to the actual threat.So... No passion. No outrage. No grief. No action. That's where most of us are.Climate activists like Bill McKibben, Al Gore and Laurie David -- and activist scientists like James Hansen and Michael Mann - have been struggling for decades to figure out how to raise the temperature of the discussion. To kindle a fire. To arouse our passions in proportion to the threat. We can blame some activists for using too much fear and guilt as motivators, and critique climate scientists for being too rational, too cool, too clinical. Many in both camps have shown a lack of psychological sophistication and used poor communication tactics.And until recently, yelling \"fire!\" hasn't been the scientists' style. Naively, they hoped that mere facts would be a sufficient accelerant for our passion. Now some of these formerly cool customers are themselves getting pretty passionate -- marching, yelling, getting arrested. They simply can't understand why so many people don't seem to care that our only home is on fire.But most of us continue to just look away, embarrassed by the scientists' now-fiery passion and willingness to go to jail. Heroes are fine in the past -- Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, Gloria Steinem, Gandhi -- but seeing science professors dragged away by cops just doesn't excite most of us. We don't want to acknowledge the very real war on science being waged by fossil-fuel-financed science-bashers who attack them at every front. We don't intervene. In fact, many of us feel annoyed at how cold, clinical, reductionistic and spirit-denying science has become. Let the scientists take care of themselves.So the general numbness and Business As Usual among people of good will continue, as the clock ticks and the planetary temperature climbs. What's the rush? Where's the fire?When will we explode in passionate defense of our homes, the air we breathe, the water we need to survive or the animals and the rest of nature with whom we share life on our small, blue homeland?The fire is accelerating. But where's our fire?_ _ _ _For those who actually would like to do something to put out the fire now engulfing Earth, please join 350.org and get out in the streets.

Californians are being asked to reduce their personal water usage by 20 percent in 2014, projected to become the driest year on record.Scientific projections regarding climate change suggest that these dry conditions could become the new normal. The drought proclamation formally recognizes that \"extremely dry conditions ... may continue beyond this year and more regularly into the future.\" This calls for permanent and fundamental changes in our behavior. Here are five ways to get started:1. Reduce leaks. As a homeowner or renter, the best way to determine if you have a leak is to turn off all taps and see if the dials still turn on your water meter. If they do, you have a leak. You are usually responsible for leaks from the meter to your property. We also need to address leaks on a district or city scale. The average California city leaks 8-10% of its water because of old pipes underground, wasting not only water but the embedded energy used in pumping and treating our water. Let your elected officials know that they need to make our community drought-proof by reducing leaks.2. 'California-friendly' gardening. Does your front lawn look suspiciously like the verdant lawns and gardens on Downton Abbey? There are more appropriate landscape choices for dry and sunny California. During dry conditions, many will let their lawns die back, but sprinkler systems eventually creep back on. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's \"Cash for Grass\" program offers $1.50-$2 per square foot for residents who install plants that thrive in dry conditions and don't require constant watering and mowing.3. Check the toilet. A little-known law takes effect this year requiring the replacement of all water-wasting toilets. Check your tank by putting vegetable dye into the tank and wait to see if it shows up in the bowl. These silent leaks add up and can be easily fixed with replacing flapper valves or new high efficiency 1.2-gallon toilets.4. Embrace greywater. Greywater systems capture the household water you use (excepting toilet and kitchen water). The systems can now be legally used in California within certain guidelines. This water can be reused for irrigation, saving it from being dumped into the stormdrain.5. Harvest rainwater. Save the rainwater that would otherwise run off your roof then down a stormdrain, and reuse it for garden watering, yard usage, or vehicle and car washing. Many cities offer rain barrels or cisterns at a discount.The drought underscores the need to address pervasive issues with California water management: contaminated and over-pumped groundwater supplies, lack of meters for agricultural entities, missed opportunities for stormwater capture and use, and wastewater recycling and direct potable reuse. Local water supply projects such as water reuse and recycling, have gotten short shrift in Sacramento compared with costly engineered options such as the diversion tunnels.California Coastkeeper Alliance is part of a coalition that is evaluating long-term solutions to water management in California, and exploring a more integrated path forward on water issues.You can find details on water conservation strategies at www.saveourh20.org.Special thanks to Connor Everts, longtime California Coastkeeper Alliance partner and executive director of the Southern California Watershed Alliance, for his efforts on this piece."}, {"title": "Fight Climate Change - Global Brands and Global Politicians to Walk the Talk", "text": "Imagine you are 95% sure that your house will burn down tomorrow. Would you get a fire insurance coverage? Scientists have been warning for many years that climate change is one of the greatest challenges humanity is facing. They are 95% sure that humans are the main drivers behind it. Yet politicians haven't bothered too much about properly covering the risk. An effort by some 120 heads of state to strike a global deal to protect the climate failed spectacularly in Copenhagen 2009.But 2014 may be different. This year may well enter the history books as the turn-around for the fight against climate change. In March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will release its Assessment Report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability - consequences of climate change will become very clear to the business community. And in September, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban-Ki Moon has invited heads of state to New York for a special summit, where a deal to cut the emissions of heat-trapping gases shall be brokered among governments.A clear indicator of the importance of the topic is the World Economic Forum's 2014 upcoming Annual Meeting at Davos, where climate change features prominently on the program. Al Gore, Lord Nick Stern, Bill Gates, Ban-Ki Moon and many others debate political solutions ahead of the big summit.In the mean time, for most of the global corporates, taking responsibility for the environment has become an integral aspect of the brand value. A great example is Swiss luxury watch manufacturer IWC. CEO Georges Kern, a World Economic Forum YGL, says: \"Environmental awareness is integral to our corporate philosophy, and we see it as part of our corporate responsibility.\" Thanks to rigorous environmental management and ecologically sound building techniques IWC has been able to keep the energy consumed by in-house utilities constant over the past 11 years. This is all the more impressive when one considers that both production and the total useful area of the facilities have more than doubled in that time. This was achieved for example by optimum insulation of the buildings or by using residual heat in the town's sewage system as a source of energy.Moreover, IWC compensates for emissions that cannot be entirely eliminated by making voluntary payments into innovative emission reduction projects from South Pole Carbon, thereby contributing additionally to poverty alleviation around the world - thus a cooperation between a YGL and a Schwab Social Entrepreneur has been created.\"The Reshaping of the World\", thematic focus of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2014, will hopefully apply to climate change this year.

They want to turn these majestic animals into frozen meat products for Europe and Asia, with no concerns about the unconscionable cost on life, health, the environment, or the integrity of our culture.Fortunately, this industry was blocked from slaughtering horses in the U.S. when the president and Congress -- echoing the voices of a clear majority of Americans -- passed legislation late last week to prohibit the use of tax dollars to inspect U.S. horse slaughter facilities. This protection -- included in a major bipartisan budget package -- effectively reinstates a ban on domestic horse slaughter for the 2014 fiscal year.Two aspects of that last line are worth calling out: \"domestic\" and \"2014.\" These are significant because the regulation does not prohibit the transport of U.S. horses for slaughter to other countries, and because it must be re-approved every year.Congress failed to include the language in the 2012 budget, opening the door for a return of horse slaughter in the U.S. Applications to open horse slaughter facilities were filed with the USDA in New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa and these plants came perilously close to opening.The international transport loophole is equally disturbing. In 2006, two foreign-owned facilities in Texas and one in Illinois killed more than 90,000 horses for human consumption in countries like France, Belgium and Japan. In 2007, all three slaughterhouses for horses in the U.S. were closed, and several states have implemented laws banning the selling, giving and possessing of horse meat intended for human consumption.But protecting our horses coast to coast in a lasting way requires passage of the Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act (S. 541/H.R. 1094), bipartisan legislation that would end the export of American horses for slaughter abroad, once and for all.Americans are overwhelmingly on the side of the horses. In a national poll commissioned by the ASPCA, 80 percent of American voters expressed opposition to the slaughter of U.S. horses for human consumption.Opposing horse slaughter on humanitarian grounds alone is a no-brainer. The majority of horses killed for human consumption are young, healthy animals who could go on to lead productive lives with loving owners. These equines suffer incredible abuse even before they arrive at the slaughterhouse. They're often transported for more than 24 hours at a time -- without food, water or rest -- in dangerously overcrowded trailers. Horses slip and fall and are often seriously injured or killed in transit.Some erroneously liken horse slaughter to euthanasia, but make no mistake: Methods used to slaughter horses rarely result in quick, painless deaths. Horses are difficult to stun and may often remain conscious during their butchering and dismemberment.Others argue that slaughtering horses in America is an acceptable alternative to shipping horses overseas for slaughter. They may be surprised to learn that even when there were active horse slaughter facilities in the U.S., tens of thousands of American horses were still exported to other countries for slaughter.Consuming horse meat is actually very dangerous. Unlike pigs or chickens, horses are not raised for food in this country. Over their lifetimes, they're routinely given drugs and other substances -- both legal and illegal -- that can be toxic to humans if ingested. And few of these substances have been approved by the FDA for use in animals intended for human consumption.A New York Times article revealed the hodgepodge of drugs regularly administered to American race horses, and resulting food safety threats. And the shocking discovery of horsemeat in beef products in the U.K. and other European countries certainly underscores the potential threat to American health if this grisly practice returns to the U.S.Last year, more than 160,000 American horses were sent to cruel deaths by foreign industries that produce unsafe food for consumers. We should no longer be party to such cruelty. Horse slaughter is simply inhumane, whether here or abroad, and a lasting end to this vile practice is the only just solution.Matthew Bershadker is President & CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

There are few more things he can do.Two hundred more things, to be precise.In a Washington D.C. news conference today, former Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter released a long menu of new ideas for the President's consideration. The ideas, collected in a report called Powering Forward, were presented to the White House last week. They were developed by Ritter's Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University (CNEE) in consultations with more than 100 U.S. thought leaders over the last 10 months. (Full disclosure: I work for the Center.)The President's in-basket is filled with recommendations from NGOs and interest groups, particularly just before his annual State of the Union address, but in this case a meeting with Obama inspired the idea-gathering exercise. Last March, Ritter was one of a group of 14 people, mostly corporate CEOs, invited to the White House to discuss energy policy with the President and his team.Ritter was called out of the room for a few minutes. When he came back, the other members of the group had \"elected\" him to lead the effort to engage experts in five areas: energy efficiency, renewable energy financing, new business models for utilities, responsible natural gas production, and alternative fuels and vehicles.After months of research, roundtables and peer reviews involving experts and corporate leaders, the result is more than 200 recommendations the Administration could implement without further action by Congress.Last week's White Housing briefing included Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe, GSA Administrator Dan Tangherlini, presidential science advisor John Holdren and Obama's top climate advisor, Dan Utech.Today at the National Press Club, Ritter was joined in announcing the report by Heather Zichal, Obama's former Deputy Assistant for Energy and Climate Change, and Dan Esty, the Commissioner for Energy and Environment in Connecticut.Many of the recommendations are ways the President can help the utility, transportation, natural gas and finance industries participate more effectively in America's transition to clean energy. But a central theme is how President Obama should use his authorities during his remaining time in office.\"When they believed a national situation warranted action, some past presidents interpreted their authority broadly and exercised it aggressively,\" the report says. \"That is the practice of presidential authority American and the world need today.\"  CNEE encouraged but did not require participants in the project to reach consensus on the recommendations. As a result, not everyone or every organization that participated agreed with all of the ideas. In addition, most of the participants accepted CNEE's invitation to remain anonymous so they were free to think big and to be bold.Among the many recommendations:Be clear about the nation's energy priorities. Although policy certainty is difficult to achieve in Washington, private sector investors like to see it before they write checks, in this case for clean energy projects. Powering Forward suggests that the Administration prioritize the nation's many energy options on the basis of full life-cycle analyses that reveal which fuels offer most energy security, environmental health and greenhouse gas reductions with the fewest down-sides.The report also encourages the President to be more specific about what \"responsible\" means in his support for responsible natural gas production. If it includes good water management, minimal land disturbance, zero tolerance for methane leaks and full disclosure of fracking fluids, for example, then the Administration should require those practices for gas production on federal lands.Vehicle and fuel manufacturers told CNEE they would like to see the Administration develop a clear roadmap for alternative fuels and vehicles based on an objective evaluation of each fuel's full life-cycle costs and benefits, including the cost of infrastructure required to get each fuel to consumers.Help investors and the public track progress on the nation's clean energy goals. As they say, you can't manage what you don't measure. And what isn't managed probably won't get done. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stopped reporting on green jobs last year after its methodology came under fire. It blamed the budget sequester. Powering Forward recommends that the BLS resume its green job reports, just as it reports employment in other industry groups.Similarly, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) should evaluate its methods for projecting the growth of renewable energy technologies in the years ahead. EIA has been criticized for underestimating renewable energy's future contribution to the nation's energy mix. Wrong projections on the low side do not encourage private investment.Remove barriers to the clean energy transition. There has been talk of a \"death spiral\" in the utility industry as nontraditional forms of power and generation take hold. New technologies and customer preferences are challenging the industry to adapt to a time when power plants are being installed on rooftops and free fuels such as solar and wind are pushing their way into the energy mix. Utility executives told CNEE they are eager to participate in a clean energy transition, but outdated regulations get in the way, some of them dating back to the 1950s and 60s. As one executive put it, \"Technology is 10 years ahead of utilities, and utilities are 10 years ahead of regulators.\" Obama could direct federal agencies to work with electric utilities and utility regulators to identify and remove unnecessary regulatory constraints.Demonstrate new utility business models in the government's power assets. The report notes that when former Energy Secretary Steven Chu tried to enlist the the government's four Power Marketing Administrations in progressive planning and practices in 2012, he ran into considerable opposition from PMA customers and, in-turn, a significant pushback from Congress. CNEE suggests that President Obama and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz meet with thought leaders in the PMA system to develop joint approaches to managing these assets for a new energy economy.Trigger more private investment in clean energy. The IRS is an independent agency, but the President can encourage it to issue a revenue ruling that allows Real Estate Investments Trusts (REITs) to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Powering Forward recommends that the IRS explore other ways to create parity in the tax code between fossil and renewable fuels. For example, the report says, the IRS should determine whether it has the administrative authority to allow Master Limited Partnerships for clean energy investments - an objective renewable energy companies have tried unsuccessfully to achieve in Congress.In addition, the President could urge the Comptroller of the Currency to verify that when community banks make loans for renewable energy projects in low and moderate income neighborhoods, the banks will earn credit under the Community Reinvestment Act.\"The President should be a steadfast champion of eliminating tax support for carbon-rich energy resources - subsidies that are perverse in a low-carbon economy - and shifting them to sustainable energy,\" the report says.Become an even bigger market force. Powering Forward urges the President to set even more aggressive goals for the government's use of Energy Saving Performance Contracts to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in federal buildings and operations. ESPCs allow the government to install energy-saving improvements with guaranteed results at no cost to taxpayers. In addition, the government's investments in these improvements help grow the national market for clean energy technologies.Help homeowners save money. Recent studies by university researchers have concluded there is less risk of mortgage defaults in energy efficient homes. Powering Forward recommends that the Administration use its extensive data on home mortgages to see if it confirms that those findings. If so, the President should direct that federal home financing programs reflect the benefits of energy efficiency in their underwriting, lending and appraisal guidelines.Support states. The importance of state and local leadership is a central theme in Powering Forward. The report notes that many of the authorities to accelerate America's transition to clean energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reside at the state and local level, including utility regulation, the regulation of natural gas production, building codes, and urban planning that reduces traffic congestion and dependence on passenger vehicles.The report encourages EPA to give states great flexibility in how they use these authorities to comply with air regulations, including upcoming limits on carbon emissions from existing power plants. It also recommends that the Administration triple its technical assistance to states on the policies and investments that are most effective in reducing carbon emissions and integrating clean energy into their economies.\"President Obama deserves credit for his resolve to take action on climate change,\" Ritter wrote in his foreword to the recommendations. \"This report is intended to help him. There simply is no more important issue and no time to waste.\"The Powering Forward report is available at www.poweringforwardplan.org."}, {"title": "Drugs, Death, Neglect: Behind The Scenes At Animal Planet", "text": "By the time three orphaned raccoons arrived for emergency care at the Kentucky Wildlife Center in April 2012, \"they were emaciated,\" says Karen Bailey, who runs the nonprofit rehab clinic set in the sunny thoroughbred country just outside of Georgetown, in central Kentucky. \"They were almost dead.\"Read more on Mother Jones"}, {"title": "Rehab, Release, Rejoice", "text": "Almost 3,000 wild animals have been treated at the Wildlife Center of Virginia this year, including 31 bald eagles. The skilled staff and devoted volunteers working at the state-of-the-art facility give animals the very best possible chance for recovery, but collisions with motor vehicles, lead poisoning and other ailments take their toll. Roughly half the patients that come to the center are unable to leave.On September 20, patient #13-2422 was admitted. The adult bald eagle, most likely a female, was rescued from Northumberland County. She was unable to fly with a wing injury, and it had taken several days for her to be captured. Veterinary intern Dr. Kristin Britton, diagnostic intern Kelli Waller and veterinary student Sara first examined the bird.The eagle was found to be dehydrated, and had an injury to the right coracoid, which is akin (roughly) to the collarbone in a person. Such an injury, however, cannot be repaired surgically. The fracture must be manipulated externally, then the wing and body are wrapped to immobilize the shoulder. \"Sometimes they heal,\" Ed Clark, Wildlife Center president and co-founder said, \"sometimes they don't.\"Bandages were applied and changed every three days. Fluids, pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication were administered, along with Selenium, which assists in the recovery of muscle tissue. As the weeks went on, rest and immobilization gradually gave way to physical therapy and increased exercise, and she was moved to larger and larger enclosures. After nearly three months of treatment and recovery, it was decided she was healthy and fit enough to be released.Belle Isle State Park, on the banks of the Northern Neck's Rappahannock River not far from where the bird was rescued, was chosen as the release site. Ed Clark would be releasing the bird, assisted by Wildlife Center Outreach staffer Chapin Hardy. The event, which was open to the public, was attended by dozens of spectators, including many Wildlife Center volunteers. Ed took a few moments to talk about the important work being done at the Center, and to explain the logistics of how the release would be done. At one point during his talk, to the delight of the crowd, a resident Bald Eagle interrupted the proceedings when it flew directly overhead.Excitement grew as Ed brought the massive bird from her transport crate. After having been enclosed for three hours, the first thing he needed to do was to simply hold her securely for a while. This gives her time to get used to her surroundings and lets her eyes adjust to the bright, mid-day sun. I am lucky to be able to see eagles from a distance fairly regularly, but viewing one this close absolutely quickens the pulse. It's just a guess on my part, but the wingspan of this bird had to be nearly seven feet.As for \"holding her securely,\" there was a bit of disagreement between Ed and the bird as to how, exactly, this should be done. Several times during the discussion she clamped her powerful beak on his gloved hand.Talons and beak were finally gathered, and the bird calmed as Ed wrapped his arms securely around her. He then slowly brought the bird around so everyone in attendance could see her up close and take photos.To me, the majesty of eagles is unequaled in nature. It is a powerful sight to behold, even more so when one considers this is not a captive bird. Yes, for a short time her life's path made a detour through the Wildlife Center of Virginia. But she was wild before that, and she'll be wild again in a matter of minutes.When they reached me, for a moment the eagle looked directly at me. Actually, through me is more apt. It wasn't exactly like eye contact, it was more of a one-way transaction. And in that brief staring contest, I am not ashamed to say I blinked.After all the photos were taken and questions were answered, there was only one thing left to do. Ed stepped away from the crowd, facing the bird away from us and toward a large field rimmed with tall evergreens. He made sure we were all ready, counted to three, and hoisted the ten-pound bird into the air. She flew, straight and true and low, at first rising and dipping with each wing beat, then leveling out to a smooth glide. Camera shutters that began in a frenzied burst now slowed to a trickle, and then for a moment all was silent. Former patient #13-2422, now carrying a little extra callous formation in her shoulder and a silver band on her foot, reached the end of the field and rose quickly and easily. She perched high in an evergreen, where she remained until after the crowd dispersed. Nervous silence turned to applause. And everyone there felt like we had not just witnessed something special, but that we were really a part of it.This bird was rescued, secured, transported, diagnosed, treated, rehabilitated and released by a team of staff and volunteers who devote countless hours to the Wildlife Center every year. Bald eagles hold a deserved, special place in the hearts of Americans, especially those who are passionate about wildlife. But it's important to remember that for every high-profile release like this, there are many other animals being safely returned to their habitat after mishaps, injuries or illness with little or no fanfare.

Thousands of gallons of a coal-cleaning agent seeped into the local water supply after it oozed out of an antiquated storage tank and then overflowed a surrounding containment area just a mile upriver from the local water plant. Significantly, inspectors had not visited the facility in more than a decade, except by a smattering of state officials focused on air pollution, who walked on by the corroded tank and the bird's eye view of the river.Disturbingly, we know very little about the effects of the chemical on humans. The weak federal Toxic Substance Control Act and the diminished enforcement power of the EPA and state officials in West Virginia have left local residents and citizens across the country wondering how their government came to be so powerless to stop this obvious hazard, made worse by the keystone-cop ineptitude of West Virginia's Governor Tomblin in the days after the spill.The search for an answer to that question leads right to the doorstep of anti-regulation politicians like Sen. Mitch McConnell from Kentucky. Decades of coal mining in the region have taken a profound toll on mountains, valleys, streams, and rivers, throughout Appalachia. And as Charleston takes its place in the history of regulatory disasters alongside the West Texas chemical plant disaster and the BP spill in the Gulf, what was the Senate Minority Leader's priority last week? Not examining how to repair the shredded regulatory infrastructure that left West Virginians without clean water. To the contrary, he's focused on cutting back further on attempts to rein in the pollution caused by coal production.Early last week, McConnell fired off a letter to the Government Accountability Office asking it to \"review\" Congress's ability to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to force an up-or-down vote to stop a proposed rule from the EPA that would require new coal-burning electricity plants to meet certain standards of air quality under the Clean Air Act. Specifically, the rule is aimed at reining in these plants' emissions of climate disrupting greenhouse gases, and it represents a key part of the EPA's efforts to tackle the problem of climate change. Take note that it is in early stages at this point; EPA has merely proposed the rule and is preparing to take comments on it. That's significant because the CRA was intended as an avenue for Congress to block final rules issued by agencies. McConnell doesn't plan to wait for the process to run its course; he wants to block the rule now. That's bad news for a lot of reasons.Pulling the rug out at the last minute like this would cause the exact kind of \"regulatory uncertainty\" that corporate interests and their allies like McConnell are so fond of railing against. In addition, time is quickly running out on averting the worst consequences of climate change; we simply cannot afford any delay of any kind in this rulemaking.But that's not the worst part, though. If McConnell's CRA move is successful, he wouldn't just block this specific rule, he would chill the development of future rules aimed at power plants unless and until Congress passes new legislation. Under the Congressional Review Act, 5 USC 801(b)(2), \"A rule that does not take effect (or does not continue)... may not be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\" McConnell's choice of the CRA may be informed by this very provision.But the strangest facet of McConnell's idea is that even if he could win votes disapproving the proposed rule in both houses of Congress, his action won't go anywhere under the CRA without the president's signature. The president, who has made EPA rules on climate change an essential part of his legacy, would never sign such legislation. McConnell is either going for the embarrassment factor or pandering to his base, or both. Under current law, he can't be serious about getting this dirty deed done.But what's most remarkable about all this is McConnell's timing. The very week that the people of Charleston were unable to drink the water that comes out of their taps because of a coal-related environmental disaster, the Minority Leader of the U.S. Senate proposed to make it easier for the coal industry to pollute. It tells you everything you need to know about his priorities."}, {"title": "Self-Interest, Reality and Global Climate Policy", "text": "Over the years, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has helped build scientific consensus about the nature of the climate problem. Climate change remains a scientific fact, and no amount of ideology or propaganda can change that. Climate scientists continue to express their alarm at the slow rate of political change and the growing use of fossil fuels in emerging economic powerhouses such as China and India. According to New York Times reporter Justin Gillis:Nations have so dragged their feet in battling climate change that the situation has grown critical and the risk of severe economic disruption is rising, according to a draft United Nations report. Another 15 years of failure to limit carbon emissions could make the problem virtually impossible to solve with current technologies, experts found...The report said that governments of the world were still spending far more money to subsidize fossil fuels than to accelerate the shift to cleaner energy, thus encouraging continued investment in projects like coal-burning power plants that pose a long-term climate risk. While the spread of technologies like solar power and wind farms might give the impression of progress, the report said, such developments are being overtaken by rising emissions from fossil fuels over the past decade, especially in fast-growing countries like China.All of this is true, but somewhat beside the point. There are many forces driving the increased use of fossil fuels, and they will not be easily countered. The first is the rising demand for economic consumption in the developing world. This demand creates a political force that is impossible to resist. Moreover, leaders in these nations largely see their job as delivering economic growth as quickly as possible. They know that the stability of their regime and their own power depends on it. The second driver of fossil fuel use are those corporations that own the resource and have massive amounts of capital invested in the infrastructure to extract, transport and burn fossil fuels. These companies and their owners are longstanding experts at projecting their economic power into political influence.This magnitude of economic and political self-interest will not be countered by a United Nations panel of experts. Some believe that since government cannot address the climate issue, the business community will somehow step into the vacuum. According to Mr. Gillis:Business leaders will tackle many of the problems raised in the draft next week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where a day will be devoted to addressing the rising economic costs of climate change -- and the costs to businesses and governments of solving the problem.Corporations, like people, should be socially responsible and should take the long view, but many do not and instead focus on short-term gain to the exclusion of all else. Self-interest drives business just as it drives politics. The business case for a thriving planet is a good one, but not really better than the public policy case.The motor for the scale of change we need can only come from one source: technological innovation. The IPCC is correct; with current technologies and the economic and political power structure governing the planet, the climate crisis cannot be solved. It is far easier to change technology than to alter the distribution of the world's political and economic power. The climate problem gets solved when renewable energy is so much cheaper and so much more convenient than fossil fuels that even the economic and political power of today's energy business cannot hold back the switch to new forms of energy. The problem only gets solved when current technology is replaced by new technology.This is not a new story. People abandoned horses for cars. Young people have abandoned land lines for cell phones. Just as quickly, they are abandoning cable TVs for entertainment on the internet. The climate problem gets solved when someone builds a renewable source of energy generation and storage as easy to use as a refrigerator, and prices it so people can afford it. Nothing else will do it.The role of government in all of this is to fund the basic and applied research that can generate the breakthrough innovations we need. The computer, Internet, GPS, and many more life-changing inventions began with research funded by the United States government. Some of this research was paid for by the Department of Defense, some by other agencies. Most of it was performed by scientists in America's great research universities (confession: like the one that I work for). The role of business is to commercialize these new technologies and get rich while doing it.With apologies to the World Economic Forum's head of environmental initiatives, business leaders will not \"tackle\" the climate problem, nor will they \"bite off pieces of the puzzle\". It is useful that they discuss the issue, think about and take it seriously, but just as government officials act to maintain political power, business leaders act to generate profit, market share and return on equity. Neither government nor business is particularly good at solving crises that are caused everywhere and have most of their impacts in the future. Most business leaders will act if and when they see the possibility of making money-or to stay within the letter of the laws that govern their behavior. There is nothing wrong with that; our economic system requires that they play that role.The degree of change required to address the climate problem and the interconnected environmental problems of global economic sustainability is massive. I am an academic, so I would never discount the importance of the thought leadership provided by the IPCC or events like Davos. However, if we look back to the last two centuries of rapid economic development, the most prominent motor of massive change has been technological innovation. Much of the innovation -- from the agricultural technology developed by America's land grant colleges to the development of the internet by the Department of Defense -- was funded by the government.Governments, businesses, and universities act according to their perceived self-interest. Scientists and engineers in and around the world's research universities are working on the technical problems of energy generation, storage, distribution and efficiency. It is in the self-interest of scientists to develop solutions to these problems. For the most part, it is not in the short term interest of political officials or business leaders to generate the massive solutions needed to address the climate issue. There is some movement by these leaders to use energy more efficiently and to switch to cleaner fuel sources. However, as the IPCC report notes, those improvements are dwarfed by increased fossil fuel use in rapidly developing nations.The desire for a global climate treaty or a carbon tax stems from noble sentiments, but since they are politically infeasible, I'm not sure they will do much to end global climate change. This drive for a global policy statement reminds me a little of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. That treaty, advocated by Columbia University President Nicholas Butler, required nations to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. It's gone real well so far, hasn't it? Nice policy, worthy goal, but meaningless public policy. While it is true that policy prescriptions that are not rooted in political reality might change that reality, I don't see that happening here.Energy is central to modern economic well-being. Climate change requires that we change the energy sources we now rely on. Efforts to force that change by raising the price of fossil fuels have failed for the past 15 years. It's time to focus our attention on the alternative path: lowering the price of renewable energy and driving fossil fuels out of business."}, {"title": "Polar Code, Set Of Proposed Arctic Shipping Rules, Could Go Into Force In 2016", "text": "By Balazs KoranyiTROMSOE, Norway, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New shipping rules are soon to be agreed for the Arctic, where summer sea ice has shrunk by about two-thirds over three decades, opening a new ocean with vast natural resources.Maritime nations are close to a landmark deal on the Polar Code, aimed to improve safety, lead to lower insurance premiums and help the rise of traffic, industry insiders said.About a tenth of the world's undiscovered oil and close to a third of its undiscovered gas is thought to lie under Arctic waters. The Northern Sea Route along Russia's edge can reduce the sailing distance between Asian ports and Northern Europe by 40 percent.A draft of the code could be finalised by members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) this week and go into force by 2016, ending years of delays, Sturla Henriksen, the director general of Norwegian Shipowners' Association said.\"There are no international conventions which regulate Arctic shipping operations, so in principle the same rules apply for sunny sailing in the Mediterranean as for the Arctic,\" Henriksen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference.\"It's a cold place, it has a hostile climate, it's enshrouded in darkness half of the year, weather is violent and extreme, distances are vast, the area is remote from large population centres, it's sparsely populated and it's far from basic infrastructure,\" Henriksen added.Only 71 ships crossed the Northern Sea Route last year, compared to the 18,000 handled by the Suez Canal, but about a 1,000 vessels travelled into the high Arctic, with much of the growth coming from oil and gas activity, particularly in Russia.The Polar Code will set stringent rules on pollution, safety of life, training, certification and watch keeping. It will prescribe ship properties including required ice class and set uniform rules for all vessels in all of the polar countries.Under the current rules, any vessel travelling into the high Arctic - defined as above 72 degrees north - had to agree on a separate policy with its insurer with unique conditions negotiated for each vessel and each journey.\"The Polar Code is a very good step forward, we endorse it but it is just a step forward, we can't stop now,\" said Stein Are Hansen, the Assistant Director of the Norwegian Hull Club, a mutual marine insurance firm.\"Any risk mitigation measures that produce fewer insurance claims will of course on average make insurance prices go down,\" Hansen said, adding that better search and rescue, improved maps and more icebreakers were still needed.If the draft is approved this week, it could get a final approval before the end of the year and go into force 18 to 24 months later.The code does not deal with the problem of ballast water discharge, which often introduces non native species to a region, and continues to allow vessels to use heavy fuel oil, a risk as the fuel would contaminate waters in case of an accident.\"We are concerned that there are important aspects that the Polar Code doesn't address,\" Nina Jensen, the head of environmental group WWF's Norwegian branch said.

CSX Railroad said it would take one to two days for workers to remove the oil and sand cargo and the derailed cars.The accident was the latest in a series of crashes or derailments of trains carrying crude oil in the United States and Canada that has raised safety concerns.The Schuylkill Expressway was closed for nearly an hour after the derailment and again at about noon, according to a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.Delays occurred as well as motorists slowed to look at a tanker car and a freight car visibly leaning sideways on the railway bridge.CSX Corp released a statement saying the 101-car freight train was headed to Philadelphia from Chicago, and that seven cars derailed on the bridge.Six of the derailed cars carried crude oil, CSX was quoted as saying.

When cleanup began, the state chose Warren County, which had a majority black population [pdf], as the dump site for some 60,000 tons of soil contaminated by the PCBs, a persistent pollutant shown to be carcinogenic in animals and dangerous to human health. In 1982 the opening of the dump site sparked demonstrations of civil disobedience and protests that helped catalyze a national movement. The fight ultimately helped lead to government policies and regulations to provide equal protection from environmental pollution for all. (See video on PCBs.)But that was all back in the 1970s and 1980s. How successful has the movement and government actions been? Consider the following facts.Coal Ash Dump - Headed for Mostly Black, Poor TownUniontown, Alabama: Site of landfill selected for dumping an estimated three million tons of coal ash spilled from a retention pond in Kingston, Tennessee, on December 22, 2008.

Hispanics also suffer worse air quality with respect to particulate matter, but not necessarily so for ozone.

A new study suggests while the overall number of El Ni\u00f1os is unlikely to increase, particularly strong \u201csuper\u201d El Ni\u00f1os are likely to occur twice as frequently in a warming world.El Ni\u00f1o refers to a pattern of unusually warm water stretching across the surface of eastern equatorial Pacific that occurs every 3-7 years. That warm water influences climate patterns around the world, increasing the likelihood of wet and cool weather in the Southeast, heavy rain in California, warm and dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest, and host of other global impacts.A map showing sea surface temperature anomalies leading up and during the 1997-98 super El Nino. Credit: NOAA ViewThe strongest El Nino ever recorded occurred in 1997-98. It led to heavy rains across the southern U.S., landslides in Peru, wildfires in Indonesia, and the cratering of the anchovy fishery in the eastern Pacific. These and other impacts were responsible an estimated $35-45 billion in damage and 23,000 deaths worldwide.Another \u201csuper\u201d El Nino in 1982-83 wreaked similar havoc globally.In a study published on Sunday in Nature Climate Change, researchers show that climate change could double the frequency of super El Nino events.To obtain the results, researchers led by Wenjun Cai, a climate modeler at Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, used 20 climate models to simulate ocean temperatures and rainfall in the tropical Pacific with and without changes in greenhouse gases. Cai looked specifically at the period of December-February, when El Nino tends to peak and its impacts are the most widespread.\u201cUnder greenhouse warming the eastern equatorial Pacific warms faster than the surrounding regions . . . making it easier to have maximum SST (sea surface temperatures) in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and hence more occurrences of extreme El Nino events,\u201d Cai said in an email.Surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific averages around 72\u00b0F, about 10\u00b0F cooler than the western tropical Pacific. Cai said that makes it easier to warm, which reduces the overall temperature difference between the two regions and makes conditions more ripe for super El Ninos to develop.Specifically, the results show that the likelihood of super El Ninos doubles from one every 20 years in the previous century to one every 10 years in the 21st century.While the results show an increase in the number of abnormally strong El Ninos, they don\u2019t show a change in the total number of El Ninos. The study also shows that the the current influence El Nino has on weather elsewhere is unlikely to change. Both are results that other studies have found as well.The core of Cai\u2019s results, that more super El Ninos are likely, was disputed by Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.He said some of the models used in the study overestimate the past number of El Nino events by a wide margin and do a poor job of representing them and their impacts.\u201cThis seriously undermines the confidence that the models do an adequate job in ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) simulations and so why should we trust their future projections?\u201d he said in an email.Trenberth also said that some long-range climate models also fail to adequately simulate other natural climate patterns that influence El Nino let alone how they might also shift in a warming world.Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society provided a similar assessment of some of the models used in the study. However, she said the methodology was sound and if the results are accurate, they could provide helpful information for scientists making seasonal forecasts around the globe and decision makers who rely on them.\u201cSince the majority of skill in seasonal forecasts is realized during El Nino events (and predictions become more skillful over more of the world's land areas), we would be able to prepare much better for the impacts of these events,\u201d she said. \u201cAdverse and costly climate happens in all years. We are just better able to predict that in years with strong El Nino and La Nina events.\u201dThough the the 1997-98 super El Nino caused extensive damage, decision makers in California poured an extra $7.5 million into flood preparedness based on seasonal forecasts that accurately predicted it months ahead of time. The state still suffered $1.1 billion in losses during the event, but that was half the total suffered during the 1982-83 super El Nino.Water managers in Tampa Bay regularly use seasonal forecasts and the predictability of El Nino to plan for water availability in the coming months.There is evidence that El Ninos has been changing already. Research published in January last year showed a roughly 20 percent increase in El Nino intensity over the course of the 20th century, though it didn\u2019t specifically attribute that change to human greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Welcome, Class -- Online Plant-Based Culinary Education Begins Today", "text": "\"It's absolutely massive -- it's everything I know about the foundational cooking principles of plant-based cuisine,\" says Chad Sarno. \"It has over 200 videos and recipes, 130 hours of course work -- it's my child, basically.\" It's Rouxbe's online plant-based culinary course and it launches today.The creator of the crazy, sexy plant-based recipes in Kris Carr's bestselling \"Crazy Sexy Kitchen\" and the face of Whole Foods' Healthy Eating Program, Sarno knows a thing or two about preparing vegan cuisine.

It can harm whales and other marine life with blasts of 230 to 250 decibels, so loud that they that can sometimes be detected 4,000 kms (2,500 miles) away.\"This work helps to set a standard,\" Carl Gustaf Lundin, director of the global marine and polar programme at the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), told Reuters.\"Once you have raised the bar ... other companies will look bad if they are not deploying it,\" he said. The IUCN includes governments, scientists and conservation organisations and is the world's biggest environmental alliance.He said there was no sign of \"significant direct impact on the whales\" from the testing off Sakhalin island north of Japan. Sakhalin Energy groups Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi.A common and worrying effect of seismic testing was that the whales move away from their normal feeding grounds, Doug Nowacek of Duke University, lead author of the findings published in the journal Aquatic Mammals, told Reuters.\"The potential exists, if animals get too close (to testing areas), for trauma and injury,\" he said, adding that to his knowledge no such cases have been documented.SPRING SEISMICThe IUCN said the guidelines called for thorough advance study of wildlife to help decide when it was best to carry out seismic tests, limiting noise levels, halting surveys if animals were seen in the area and follow-up monitoring.\"This is a comprehensive guidebook for how to do this with minimal impact,\" said Nowacek.Off Sakhalin, for instance, understanding whale migrations meant it was best to do seismic testing in spring, after ice had melted but before many whales had returned to the region.Whale sightings also varied a lot from year to year.\"A clear message is that it is not enough to send out a few people for a week or two in a boat and then decide how many whales there are,\" said Greg Donovan, who chairs an IUCN group looking into the problem of the whales and seismic surveys.More stringent guidelines would tend to push up costs of environmental monitoring, especially if it meant million-dollar delays to drilling. On the other hand, harming wildlife could damage companies' reputations.Whales are especially vulnerable to seismic testing.\"Whales rely on sound for communication, navigation and foraging,\" an IUCN statement said. \"Exposure to loud noise from seismic surveys can result in stress and behaviour changes, affect foraging and nursing, or cause direct physical damage.\""}, {"title": "New York State Hearing Shows Ivory Crisis Should Be Everyone's Concern", "text": "Elephants are well-known for their memories.

Inspired by the current poaching crisis, a new global awareness movement aimed at protecting wild elephant populations has arisen and is now making great strides in attracting attention and driving action at the highest levels of government.WCS Executive Vice President for Public Affairs John Calvelli joins WCS VP for Species Conservation Elizabeth Bennett, WCS President & CEO Cristian Samper and Jane Goodall at the Clinton Global Initiative's announcement of a 3-year, $80-million Commitment to Action to protect African elephants. Photo \u00a9 Julie Larsen Maher/WCS.In November of 2012 then Secretary of State Clinton helped to shine a spotlight on the crisis by bringing together NGOs, governments, and concerned citizens to discuss a strategy on how to stop the slaughter of Africa's elephants. An Executive Order by President Obama in July earmarked $10 million for training and technical assistance in Africa to combat wildlife trafficking and created the White House Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking.Last fall, 18 global conservation groups announced a three-year, $80 million Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Commitment to Action to stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand for ivory. The organizations were joined by seven African heads of state calling on consumer and transit countries to ban the sale of ivory until elephant populations rebound.In November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made waves by crushing close to six tons of confiscated ivory at its repository in Denver, CO. And our Congress has shown its support by appropriating $45 million in new funding to combat wildlife trafficking in its recent Fiscal Year 2014 budget, along with real interest in a bill that would place a moratorium on all domestic ivory sales.Such a bill would acknowledge that the U.S. is the 2nd largest market for ivory sales in the world after China. New York City is a major hub in this country for this trade. In 2012, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, seized more than $2 million worth of elephant ivory at just three jewelry shops in New York City.Some of $2 million in illegal elephant ivory seized by the in New York City in 2012 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. Photo: Manhattan District Attorney's OfficeTo better understand the connection of the poaching crisis to our state, the New York State Assembly held a hearing recently on the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking -- the first such hearing at the state level. Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney, Chair of the Assembly's Standing Committee on Environmental Conservation, pushed for the hearing after we met to discuss the issue at WCS's Bronx Zoo.Assemblyman Sweeney is disturbed that \"New York has become one of the main points of entry for the illegal ivory trade,\" and for that reason he wants to see a policy change on the local level. One outcome of the hearing may eventually be a push for a statewide ban on ivory sales. WCS will be supporting such action through its newly launched 96 Elephants campaign.That campaign, based on the number of African elephants killed daily in 2012 due to poaching, is aimed at educating the public about ivory trade and consumption. If we can galvanize public support through local events, city and state leaders will be more compelled to take action. So far more than 100,000 people have shared their support and sent a message to our government leaders that something needs to be done.As a part of WCS's 96 Elephants campaign, 96 fourth, fifth, and sixth-grade students at Brook Park Elementary in Indianapolis gather to raises awareness of the elephant poaching crisis.

Dolphins are capable of highly flexible behavior, and therefore are considered intelligent. Moreover, Bottlenose dolphins remember the signature whistle of each individual pod member even when separated for more than two decades, making them champions for the longest memory among non-human species according to scientists at the University of Chicago. Interestingly, just like human teenagers experiment with hallucinogenic drugs so, too, do juvenile Bottlenose. They carefully manipulate Pufferfish (rather aptly-named) to release its toxins, pass it amongst one another like a joint of marijuana and then drop into a trance. This deliberate behavior appears to carry some of the hallmarks of human drug use. Clearly, human and Bottlenose are very similar creatures.Bottlenose juveniles like to experience the high from Pufferfish poison not dissimilarly to juvenile Earthlings as they, too, experiment with mind altering plant drugs.

Last week the Chinese chief energy planning agency, the National Energy Administration (NEA) concluded its annual work session with a plan for  for a whopping 50 billion m\u00b3 coal-to-gas (CTG) output target for 2020. According to the NEA, if the target is carried out, CTG could supply one-eighth of China's gas consumption by the end of this decade. The problem is, in reality this just means more coal consumption -- which means more catastrophic air pollution.Throughout 2013, the Chinese government gave an unprecedented set of green lights to 15 CTG applications. To put that in context, a grand total of 4 approvals existed before last year. All these projects are expected to convert coal into synthetic natural gas (SNG) through various gasification processes. The reason? Coal industry advocates, want to solve the severe air pollution through the substitution of coal to gas. The problem of course is that this is the same old wine just in a new bottle.Under the guise of \"addressing air pollution\" these plans will do nothing more than increase the problem -- the consumption of coal. Ironically, it is exactly the same coal companies that contribute most to air pollution that are now selling the \"silver bullet\" of CTG as a solution to the problem they themselves create. As a matter of fact, CTG will neither stem China's growing air pollution crisis, nor upgrade its energy infrastructure. Instead it will further lock China to its coal addiction - with a whole set of new environmental risks.CTG entails significant carbon emissions, water consumption, as well as air and water pollution. If the 2020 CTG target is met, 12 billion tons of CO2 will be emitted over the 40 year timespan of these projects -- close to two years of China's total CO2 emissions.The water impacts are potentially more concerning. China is already facing a coal and water crisis given the enormous water withdrawals the coal industry requires. According to  one study, one cubic meter of SNG requires 6 to 10 liters of water to produce. The target will therefore exacerbate China's water conflict by adding 300-500 million tons of water consumption yearly. Considering 77 percent of the approved capacity will operate in water stressed regions, this huge pipeline of CTG projects are simply unaffordable to China's dry west.In the long run the NEA's plan could fundamentally re-shape the geographic layout of coal production and the growth trajectory of the whole sector. The target would imply coal consumption of about 160-180 million tonnes per year. This might not sound like a huge addition given China's enormous appetite for coal, but consider that half of the CTG projects approved are located in Xinjiang, China's far western autonomous region with abundant yet largely untouched coal reserves. The CTG target will certainly unleash a local coal development rush in an ecologically fragile place, where the current water consumption rate has already gone beyond the provincial water allocation cap. If left unchecked, the gradually declining consumption of coal in China's eastern economic powerhouse will rapidly turn west. China will miss its opportunity to truly optimize its energy and economic structure and diversify away from coal.The catastrophic air pollution China experienced in 2013 has proven China's decades-old coal obsession is simply unsustainable. The result was a set of ambitious air pollution control plans to slash coal consumption. The coal industry seems set on rebranding its toxic product in \"new bottles.\" Failing to recognize it as such will only undermine China's important steps to reign in this crisis."}, {"title": "3 Lies SeaWorld Wants You To Believe", "text": "Just three of the smaller lies SeaWorld instructs its employees to tell guests about the whales:Read more on www.upworthy.com"}, {"title": "Extreme Weather Photos Of The Week", "text": "This week brought several big headlines in extreme weather news:Check out photos of the week's extreme weather from around the world:"}, {"title": "Well, This Is One Way To Remove A Dead Whale From The Beach", "text": "A massive sperm whale was laid to rest in a landfill recently after being transported from its stranding site in the bed of a tractor-trailer -- an odd sight for any Scottish drivers on the road at the time.The whale stranded on Portobello Beach in Edingburgh, Scotland last weekend. Because this monstrous cetacean was so big -- weighing 28 tons and measuring 45 feet long -- it was logistically difficult to bury and necropsy on site, and had to be transported away.Original reports attributed this whale's death to boat strikes, but there was \"no evidence\" of this, Dr. Andrew Brownlow, the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme's Veterinary Investigation Officer, said in an email to The Huffington Post. \"The 'cuts' previously identified by others were in fact normal anatomical grooves which had abraded so they looked like traumatic lesions,\" he said. Toxicology, DNA and diet analysis samples taken at the necropsy lent no evidence of \"anthropogenic trauma\" or disease.Instead, the whale likely followed food into the North Sea and became disoriented in shallow waters, Brownlow told the Scottish Agricultural College. The North Sea is considered to be a \"whale trap\" for sperm whales, since it's too shallow for squid -- their main prey -- and hard to navigate out of, according to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme.Once in these shallow waters, the whale died from the pressure of its own weight crushing its organs and tissue. \"This usually, and for welfare reasons thankfully, causes the animal to die quite quickly,\" Brownlow told HuffPost. \"Even if animals this size are refloated on the following tide, crushed muscles groups begin a cascade of pathological processes which invariably lead to its death. It is similar to compartment syndrome in human trauma cases.\"Sperm whales are distributed throughout the world's oceans from tropical waters to the edge of pack ice at the poles, according to NOAA. They have the largest-known brain size of any animal, though it's considered small in relation to their massive body size.

Knowlton justifies the hunt in the name of 'conservation,' as his money will allegedly be spent to save other Namibian wildlife. However, his insensitivity and flawed logic, shared by the hunting clubs that give him cover, have earned him disdain from every circle.Fewer than 5,000 black rhinos remain in the wild. They need our urgent aid: not a hunter's bullet. This is not real conservation; this is rhino slaughter for sport.Knowlton continues to display his willful ignorance all over national media, twisting the facts to rationalize his hunt. In a desperate move to save his reputation, Knowlton has attempted to position himself as a well-intentioned proponent of conservation and, unbelievably, as this story's true victim. He laments the audacity of those who would criticize his bloodlust. To be clear, he has received some seriously aggressive threats -- and that's not the kind of compassion I advocate. But that does not change a thing about the denial he is in concerning the mythical benefits of the hunt.Born Free USA is appalled by Knowlton's brazen attitude, and even more bewildered by his guise of 'conservation.'As my colleague Adam Roberts, Executive Vice President of Born Free USA said today:A conservation plan cannot include the willful killing of a member of an endangered species. Real conservation involves securing protected areas, mobilizing wildlife law enforcement, and stopping illicit trade -- which can be achieved without resorting to sensationalized carnage. If Knowlton has $350,000 to spend on conservation, then he should spend it on true conservation. It's purely unnecessary, and simply counterproductive, to hunt an endangered animal in the process. For a species as imperiled as the rhino, every animal's life is significant.The only silver lining in this perverse story is that Knowlton's hunt has garnered massive publicity. Just this week, public awareness of rhino hunting has exploded -- and the overwhelming response seems to be vehement disapproval. In the brief moment that this story exists in the fleeting public consciousness, the global conservation community must seize the opportunity to educate the public about the rhino's serious plight.Hunting rhinos at a time when the world is lamenting their demise, when our children may see a day where no wild rhinos exist, is absurd.

That Would Be Good News for the Economy and for the Environment", "text": "The European Union is considering scrapping the use of binding renewable energy targets as part of its global climate change policy mix that will extend action from 2020 to 2030. The Financial Times reported that this move \u2014 presumably due to concerns over high European energy costs during the ongoing economic turndown \u2014 will \"please big utility companies but infuriate environmental groups.\" The International New York Times framed the story in similar ways.The press coverage has missed the very important reality that this potential decision by the European Commission will be good news both for the economy and for the environment. The fundamental reason is that in the presence of the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) \u2014 its pioneering, regional cap-and-trade system that covers electricity generators and large-scale manufacturing \u2014 the \"complementary\" renewables mandate conflicts with, rather than complements other policies. Without the renewables mandate, the cap being planned for the EU ETS will be achieved at lower cost and will foster greater incentives for climate-friendly technological change.Some BackgroundIn 2007, the European Union established three sets of targets and related policies: (1) a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 1990 by 2020, to be achieved by the cap-and-trade system; (2) a 20 percent target for 2020 for the share of Europe's electricity consumption coming from renewable resources; and (3) a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. These are the so-called \"20-20-20 targets\" for the year 2020. A wonderful slogan, but a flawed policy, because of perverse interactions among the three elements.Europe is well on its way to achieving the first goal, with emissions now reduced by about 18 percent, and it is now looking to establish targets for the subsequent decade. At the same time, Europe is continuing to experience its greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, while European electricity prices have risen by some 40 percent since 2005 (while the U.S. economy rebounds, with electricity prices actually having fallen \u2014 mainly because of low natural gas prices). Therefore, there is great concern in European capitals and at EU headquarters in Brussels about high energy prices damaging the international competitiveness of European industry.Plans for 2030Although the planned, new emissions targets for 2030 may increase stringency from the currently mandated 20 percent cut by 2020 to perhaps a 35 percent or even 40 percent cut by 2030, it now appears that the European Commission may drop specific binding constraints on the share of electricity generated from renewables. Why would this elimination of the renewables target be good news not only economically, but environmentally as well?Perverse Policy InteractionsUnder the umbrella of a cap-and-trade scheme, unless a complementary policy addresses some other market failure that is not addressed by the price signals of the cap-and-trade mechanism (such as the principal-agent problem thought to retard energy-efficiency adoption decisions in renter-occupied properties), these complementary policies that are under the cap will either be irrelevant or counter-productive. Here is the basic logic.That is the perverse trifecta of a complementary renewables policy under the umbrella of a cap-and-trade scheme, such as the EU ETS: no additional emissions reductions are achieved; but costs are driven up; and technological change is retarded.If the European Commission decides to eliminate its renewables targets as it proceeds with more stringent emissions targets for 2030 under the EU ETS, it will be good news both for the economy and the environment."}, {"title": "National Zoo's Panda, Bao Bao, Makes Her Debut To Visitors (VIDEO)", "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The nation's capital gained a new star on Saturday when the National Zoo's 4-month-old panda bear cub made her debut to long lines of visitors.The panda cub, Bao Bao, went on exhibit at the Giant Bear Habitat, accompanied by her mother, Mei Xiang, said zoo spokeswoman Annalisa Meyer.\"She's doing great.

Held at the gleaming Newseum, site of many such events, it was entitled, \"U.S. Energy Policy: The Road Ahead,\" and appeared to be a genuine policy discussion. It was, in fact, an infomercial.The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), a major trade organization for the U.S. coal industry, sponsored the event. ACCCE was paying to have an energy discussion before journalists and policymakers -- and for the opportunity to have ACCCE's CEO Mike Duncan lead off the program with remarks arguing that coal remains essential to the U.S. economy. Duncan, who is a former head of the Republican National Committee and cofounder of the Karl Rove super PAC American Crossroads, candidly called his opening remarks a \"paid commercial\" and asked the audience to respect his purchase by quieting down to listen carefully. But in fact the whole event, not just Duncan's remarks, was tilted by ACCCE money.The moderator, Real Clear Politics' Carl Cannon, admitted that the one panelist skeptical of the energy industry, Peter Ogden, was outnumbered. Ogden is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress (where I used to work) and a former Obama White House and State Department official. The other speakers were all enthusiastic backers of the energy industries -- Ross E. Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers; Dan Kish of the Institute for Energy Research and William Yeatman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, both think tanks backed by energy companies and conservative foundations; and Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from coal-dominated West Virginia.While Real Clear Politics itself clearly leans to the right, an almost identical event was sponsored over the summer by a publication that always claims that it is scrupulously fair and unbiased, but in fact sometimes seems to rent out its reputation to industries seeking to influence Washington -- Politico. (Recently, Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple has accused Politico reporter Mike Allen of giving favorable coverage in his Playbook column to corporate interests that advertise there.)On a day last July when Washington D.C. neighborhoods sweltered in oppressive, 96-degree heat, air conditioned vehicles pulled up to the well-cooled Newseum for a Politico-hosted, and ACCCE-sponsored, event entitled \"Future of Energy Briefing -- What's Next for 2013\" (video). The general public wasn't invited; the event location wasn't even included on the Politico website. The only people welcome were paying Politico customers and invited guests, most notably the event's real target audience: news reporters and other opinion-shapers.A top White House environment and energy official, Heather Zichal, appeared on the program, interviewed by a Politico reporter. After that, there was a panel discussion, featuring Congressman John Garamendi, Democrat of California, a supporter of efforts to combat climate change, and Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, one of the most aggressive advocates for the coal industry. Barrasso's state is more dependent on the industry than any other; it produces about 40 percent of all U.S. coal. Two weeks earlier, Barrasso had attacked President Obama's \"war on coal.... a war on American jobs, American manufacturing and on American families looking for affordable energy.\"The panel's third speaker appeared, on the surface, to be poised to balance the discussion -- Margot Anderson, Executive Director of the Energy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC). The BPC presents itself as a think tank offering sensible bipartisan positions. But the group receives contributions from a wide range of business interests, and quite often its policy prescriptions seem tilted toward those supporters. Anderson's energy project is chaired by two former Senators, Trent Lott and Byron Dorgan, who are both now lobbyists for energy companies, and its February 2013 report read like a wish list for the energy industry. With respect to coal, the BPC report did not warn of coal's heavy contribution to global warming, or call for new regulations on power plants; it only called for accelerated government efforts to develop so-called \"clean coal,\" or carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, a multi-billion dollar federal project that has produced very little over 15 years. Among the BPC's donors are coal-dependent energy companies like Entergy and Southern Company.As with the Real Clear Politics event, ACCCE's Mike Duncan opening the Politico discussion with keynote remarks extolling coal.Similarly, at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, energy conglomerate Southern Company, whose assets include coal plants, paid for an energy policy event hosted by The National Journal and Atlantic Magazine, another regular participant in the pay-to-play field.The coal industry's buying of these events is part of what the National Journal recently described as a \"new public-relations and lobbying blitz\" aimed at shoring up political support as it faces perhaps its greatest challenge. Over the summer President Obama gave a speech at Georgetown University, where he pledged to make progress in the fight against global warming. Obama proposed new rules to curb carbon emissions from existing power plants, rules that could imperil the coal industry. Coal, while supplying much of America's power for decades, has also caused immense environmental destruction and is a leading driver of global warming. The threat to coal's survival comes not only from government's seeking to curb toxic pollution but also from the rapid growth of natural gas and renewable energy sources.Coal's perennial strategy has been to deny the harms caused by the industry, a steady deception that is reflected in recent pronouncements by coal industry officials -- despite the overwhelming scientific evidence -- that the burning of coal and other fossil fuels is not causing global warming. Coal also spins fantasies about the promise of \"Clean Coal,\" and carbon sequestration, promises that they know cannot be kept, but that they believe will buy them time.In the last election cycle, ACCCE ran a $35 million ad and faux-grassroots campaign asserting that Obama was waging a job-destroying War on Coal. However, Coal's 2012 effort was mostly a failure. Obama crushed Mitt Romney and won the key coal belt swing states -- Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Coal's influence on congressional races appeared in decline.Still, the industry keeps fighting, with an eye on influencing key 2014 races, including through the practice, now common among wealthy industries, of buying, and slanting, policy events hosted by media companies, who are eager to rent their reputations for cash.This article also appears on Republic Report."}, {"title": "If You See Something, Say Something", "text": "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2014 THE overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that human-caused climate change is happening.Read more on The New York Times"}, {"title": "Honolulu's Sewage System Stinks..

The Bay draws thousands of tourists a day as a world-famous snorkeling destination, but the site was closed on Thursday for \"emergency maintenance.\" Apparently wastewater backup shut down the facility's restrooms and forced the beach's closure for about 90 minutes.Over on the other side of Honolulu, the residents of Kakaako felt Hanauma Bay's pain. As an up and coming neighborhood, Kakaako is undergoing serious growing pains -- mostly in the olfactory system.In response to numerous complaints and questions surrounding Kakaako's stench, the Honolulu City Council was recently forced to report about its causes and potential solutions. Pressure in the sewers, they concluded, was to blame, and they promised that remedies like new devices in manholes would alleviate the odor.But with as many as 30 new buildings being planned in the neighborhood, including several luxury high-rises, many in Honolulu worry that the existing sewer system just isn't up to the task.\"I thought about moving because of the smells,\" Deborah Whisnand, a Kakaako resident told Hawaii News Now back in September.\"You can tell it's sewage smell,\" Regina Torres told KHON2. \"It's very strong, it's hard to breathe at times.

They were on the path toward extinction until a few years ago, when they were protected under the Endangered Species Act.It took some prodding, but in 2006 the federal government protected 2,500 square miles of some of their most important summer habitat in the Puget Sound.Turns out, though, these restless Puget Sound orcas don't stick around in the winter and spring.New research shows that this whale population -- divvied up into three lively pods -- loves to travel, especially in the winter. Last year scientists found that, over the course of just a few months, they cruised from Cape Flattery, at the far northwestern tip of Washington, down along the Oregon Coast to Northern California's Point Reyes.Along the way, these close-knit family groups traveled through more than 9,000 square miles of marine habitat, often in search of migrating salmon at the base of coastal rivers. Now that we know, it only makes sense to protect those migratory areas too.That's why this week, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned to designate the whales' winter foraging areas along the West Coast as protected \"critical habitat.\"Critical habitat designations prevent the federal government from undertaking or approving activities that reduce an area's ability to support an endangered species. Studies show that species with designated critical habitat are more than twice as likely to show signs of improvement than those without.It's clear these killer whales need it.There were once an estimated 200 members of the \"southern population.\" The population has endured several significant declines since the 1960s, hitting a low of 67 in 1971.Although the population has shown signs of stabilizing, these whales still face a litany of threats. Human activities in and near coastal waters reduce salmon numbers, generate toxic pollution and increase ocean noise, which disrupts the orcas' ability to communicate and locate prey.All those threats will have to be addressed, but the immediate task should be safeguarding the last remaining places these rare whales need to survive, especially those foraging waters along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California.Photo: NOAA"}, {"title": "A Compromise We Can't Afford", "text": "Yesterday, the Sierra Club and 17 other environmental, environmental justice and public health advocacy groups sent a letter to President Obama in which we asked him to stop basing national energy policy on an \"all of the above\" strategy.

Some journalistic principles are enduring, however, and for good reason. The enterprise depends on a commitment to establishing and reporting facts, and to communicating them with accuracy and fairness. This is a foundational component of a civil and democratic society.This is one of the reasons for my disappointment in the tone of coverage given to The HSUS by more than a few members of the agricultural press over the last several years. Some writers with industry trade journals and other information outlets in the sector have settled into an unquestioning reliance upon false claims about The HSUS, including those being spun by the highly discredited and disreputable public-relations operative Rick Berman, who's fought the medical community on tanning beds and trans fats, Mothers Against Drunk Driving on alcohol use and automobiles, unions on minimum wage issues, and anti-smoking groups on behalf of major tobacco companies.At one level, it's a boon for an advocacy organization to have a Darth Vader-type adversary, since it reminds supporters of our effectiveness and the stakes. In the time that Berman has been conducting his brand attack, we've driven rather extraordinary changes in society and more than doubled in size. He's an extreme example of the third-party players in American politics who will say just about anything to sow division and polarization, mainly to line their own pockets.At The HSUS, we don't expect everyone to agree with all of our positions, and we understand we'll get push back on our attempts to stop extreme confinement of animals on industrialized farms, to stop tail-docking of cows, and to advance other limited reforms. We get it, and that's all part of the discourse and rough-and-tumble of debate about serious issues. It's also one of the reasons that we operate with such transparency, and are so active in communicating what we do and what we stand for. Here are some specific elements of our governance and our approach that I'd ask you to consider:The HSUS is highly scrutinized because it tackles tough, controversial issues. We talk about all the issues we focus on, we are the number one animal-care provider in the United States, and we campaign aggressively to advance our animal welfare agenda. Our adversaries would rather that we not focus on them, and we understand that. But this is who we are, and we're going to continue that work because we think that it's right and because that's what our members support. We are not troubled by critical questions, and we are always willing to answer them. And while we'll always deal with people who will try to define us in false ways, we'll continue to hope that serious-minded journalists - whether they work for an industry trade publication or a general news-gathering organization - will work to separate fact from fiction and treat the broad topic of animal welfare with the seriousness it deserves.Sincerely,Wayne PacelleMy end of year blogs that catalogue our work:"}, {"title": "Oil Train Safety Issues Were Known Before Recent Crashes, NBC Investigation Shows", "text": "Several recent deadly and destructive derailments have drawn greater attention to using railroads to ship crude oil, but a new NBC News investigation found that federal regulators have known about the risks for some time.Overloading trains and mislabeling tanks are among the problems that officials flagged months before the deadly crash at Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec in July 2013 according to U.S. government report obtained by NBC. It's unclear if the report was shared with Canadian railroad regulators.A team of hazardous materials inspectors with the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration visited dozens of rail facilities in North Dakota in the fall of 2011 and again in June 2012. The officials found overloaded tank cars to be a \"major problem,\" and noted that it was caused by the fact that many of the truckers who transport the crude from well sites to the trains lacked the ability to effectively measure the weight of the load entering the tank cars.Inspectors said there is a regional shortage of rail tank cars. Their reports even cited one company that transloads oil from trucks into trains that was found shipping the product in tank cars that weren't up to code. Pressure on the loading company to ship the oil, according to the report, \"was more than the risk of failure in transportation or discovery by FRA.\"During a second round of visits to facilities in North Dakota in 2012, inspectors discovered that some companies had also mislabeled the oil as less flammable than it really was. NBC explains:Companies handling relatively dangerous crude were shipping it under labels meant for more stable, less flammable crude, inspectors found. Paperwork at the facilities showed the companies were dealing with crude designated as Packing Group I or II, designations for high or moderate risk materials.The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued an alert on January 2 stating, \"recent derailments and resulting fires indicate that the type of crude oil being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil.\"North Dakota has seen a boom in oil and gas production from the Bakken formation, which underlies part of the state (along with portions of Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan). More than 10 percent of U.S. oil production now comes from this rock formation and the hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil produced every day in North Dakota exceed the capacity of existing pipeline infrastructure. Many oil producers have turned to rail to ship their crude to refineries. Most U.S. oil pipelines run north-south, but the Bakken producers' light crude usually fetches a higher price at markets on the east or west coast, InsideClimate News explains.Over 99.99 percent of hazardous material rail shipments reach their destinations safely, according to the railroad industry, but the oil-by-rail boom has brought several notable, and fiery, crashes in recent years.In July 2013, a 72-car oil train from North Dakota derailed and exploded in the small town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec killing 47 people and setting off a debate on railroad safety.Another train derailment in North Dakota last month spilled about 400,000 gallons of crude.There have also been numerous other incidents involving a class of rail tank car known as DOT-111. The DOT-111 -- a giant, black, pill-shaped tanker that can carry 34,500 gallons of oil, chemicals, fuel or other liquids -- represents 69 percent of all U.S. rail tank cars. Accidents are not unheard of for these cars, and the federal government has known about the DOT-111's \"inadequacy\" for transporting certain materials since at least 1991.In September, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration announced it was seeking public comments for a new set of rules to improve the safety of railroad tank cars.The Association of American Railroads -- an industry trade group representing major freight carriers, Amtrak and some commuter railroads -- announced in November that it supports efforts to improve the puncture resistance of new DOT-111s, make retrofits to older tank cars and phase-out those cars that cannot be retrofitted, among other changes.\"The industry, if they are motivated, can undertake preventative steps that will enhance the safety of the movement of these materials across the country,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said this week following a closed-door safety meeting with oil and railroad executives, according to the Associated Press."}, {"title": "You Will Never Look At Sweet Potatoes The Same Way After Seeing This Little Girl's Experiment", "text": "The results of a young girl called Elise's experiment have a lot to tell us about what goes into our vegetables.The experiment, which was filmed in 2011, has gone viral with over 1.2 million views. Elise explains how she tried to sprout vines from three different kinds of sweet potatoes -- a non-organic potato from the grocery store, an organic potato from the same store, and a potato from an organic food market -- by partially submerging them in mugs of water. The outcome is startling: The first potato failed to sprout entirely, the second finally grew \"wimpy little vines\" over a month, and the third had long green shoots after only a week.Elise and her grandmother were told that the reason for the different results is the application of the chemical chlorpropham, commercially known as '\"Bud Nip.\" According to the Pesticide Information Project, chlorpropham is a \"plant growth regulator used for pre-emergence control of grass weeds\" and is sprayed on a long list of produce items.\"Chlorpropham can kill animals that they've tested it on. It can even cause tumors. With all the chemicals, no wonder so many people are getting diagnosed with cancer. Which potato would you rather eat?\" Elise says at the end of the video.But Professor Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University's Office for Science & Society, takes a less alarming approach to the chemical's use. In a blog post in response to the video, Schwarcz admits chlorpropham can be toxic in large doses, but explains that \"a great deal of work goes into determining safe levels for humans. And the amounts found on sweet potatoes are way way below any level that would pose a danger.\"Still, little Elise's experiment gives us some food for thought.H/T Spirit Science and Metaphysics"}, {"title": "Congress Takes Landmark Decision for Rivers and Rights", "text": "Dams have turned freshwater into the ecosystem most threatened by species extinction, displaced 80 million people and impoverished many more. Even so, the World Bank is eager to re-engage in large dam projects around the world, and other financiers are following in its wake. The US Congress has now poured cold water on these plans. In a landmark decision, it has instructed the US government to oppose the construction of large dams in international financial institutions, and called for justice for the victims of human rights abuses in their projects.The new instructions were sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt), and are part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the budget compromise which was approved by the US Senate and House this week. In the section on multilateral financial institutions, the act says:\"The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director of each international financial institution that it is the policy of the United States to oppose any loan, grant, strategy or policy of such institution to support the construction of any large hydroelectric dam (as defined in ''Dams and Development: A New Framework for Decision-Making,'' World Commission on Dams (November 2000)).\"(Like the dam industry, the World Commission on Dams basically defines dams as large if they are at least 15 meters high. You can find the language on p. 1361 of the voluminous act.)At a time when better solutions are readily available, the Congressional decision supports a shift of public funding from large, often destructive hydropower projects to decentralized renewable energy solutions which are more effective at reducing energy poverty and protecting the environment. Under the new mandate, the US executive directors will have to object to dam projects such as Inga 3 on the Congo, Dasu on the Indus, Adjarala in Togo, Amaila Falls in the rainforest of Guyana, and the dams in the Nam Ngiep and Sekong river basins in Laos.The budget act also takes action to support the victims of human rights abuses in development projects. It instructs the US government to \"seek to ensure that each such institution responds to the findings and recommendations of its accountability mechanisms by providing just compensation and other appropriate redress to individuals and communities that suffer violations of human rights, including forced displacement, resulting from any loan, grant, strategy or policy of such institution.\" More specifically, Congress asks for regular updates about measures undertaken by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to ensure reparations for the survivors of the massacres carried out under the Chixoy dam project in Guatemala. (See p. 1240 for this provision.)More than 400 Maya Achi indigenous people were killed in a series of massacres to make way for the World Bank and IADB's Chixoy Dam on the Rio Negro in 1978. With support from International Rivers and other activists, the survivors of the massacre negotiated a reparations agreement with the Guatemalan government in 2010, but the government and financiers have dragged their feet on implementing it ever since. The new decision by the US Congress makes a big step towards finally bringing justice to the victims of the Chixoy massacres and other human rights abuses.The World Bank has close to 200 member countries. The Bank and other international financial institutions are free to ignore the position of the US executive directors. If this happens, Congress should redirect its financial contributions to institutions that are more willing and better equipped to support clean local energy solutions. Through the Power 4 People campaign, International Rivers and other organizations are calling on governments and national parliaments to shift $1.6 billion from the World Bank's International Development Association to the Green Climate Fund and other appropriate channels for decentralized renewable energy solutions.The language in the new congressional act is a breakthrough for healthy rivers and the rights of river-based communities, and we salute all the efforts that made it possible. At the same time, serious problems in the global energy policy of the US government and Congress continue to exist. First, the appropriations bill that was originally drafted by the Senate instructed the US government to oppose not just large dams, but also coal projects in international financial institutions. Under pressure from the fossil fuel lobby, coal projects were dropped from the final text in the negotiations with the House of Representatives. Policies to protect the climate in the operations of US export financiers were also rolled back.Secondly, the US government plans to increase its support for large hydropower dams in Africa such as the Inga 3 Dam through USAID and the new Power Africa initiative at the same time as Congress is asking it to oppose such projects in international financial institutions. The US should not fund projects bilaterally that it would reject on the multilateral level. We celebrate an important breakthrough for rivers and rights today. Making the new policy more consistent will be the task for tomorrow.Peter Bosshard is the Policy Director of International Rivers."}, {"title": "Freedom Industries, Company Behind West Virginia Chemical Spill, Files For Bankruptcy", "text": "The company behind the massive chemical spill that made tap water unsafe for more than 300,000 West Virginians has filed for bankruptcy, according to documents obtained by The Huffington Post.According to bankruptcy filings, Freedom Industries, wholly owned by Chemstream Holdings Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday.

And for good reason. DCist has a kill shot you might want to check out; here's a Twitter bite-by-bite of one observed incident:Roll Call's Heard on the Hill, which has been especially deft at covering the fox's goings-on, spoke with a former House staffer now enjoying life in Colorado about how get this animal to come closer.

Department of Health spokesperson Najma Roberts tells HuffPost that the DOH hadn't actually known about the fox before WTOP's report. She said that, once aware, animal control -- which falls under DOH's jurisdiction -- would be setting traps for the fox, then would examine it for signs that it could be a danger.Roberts said that capturing and testing the fox does not mean that the city will be killing the fox, and that the \"ultimate goal is not to harm the animal. Ultimately, we hope to release the animal.\"\"Residents should stay away from, never feed or engage with any wild animal,\" she said, advising that anyone in Washington who sees an animal behaving strangely in any way should call 311.Meantime, here is some evidence that this fox is hardly the first to grace the U.S. Capitol grounds:And here's some evidence that Godwin's law -- which posits that every internet conversation will eventually devolve into someone accusing someone else of being a Nazi -- needs to be expanded to say that every conversation about a fox will end with someone asking what, perchance, that animal says.Let's just settle this part of the record, OK?

The black rhino is considered \"critically endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the white rhino is classified as \"near threatened.\" Both subspecies live in South Africa.The drastic rise in rhino deaths has been tied to skyrocketing demand in Asia for the creatures' horns.

Scott famously described it as: \"An awful place,\" and their journey over the plateau as \"awful monotony,\" and while Tarka and I have had a pretty unique glimpse into the sort of deprivation, exhaustion and suffering they must have battled, we're also awestruck at their tenacity and spirit in the face of such profound isolation and risk; neither of which we have come anywhere near experiencing, with our daily satellite phone calls, emails, live satellite tracking and messages from loved ones, friends and supporters including our partners, Land Rover and Intel.Captain Scott and his men's incredible display of fortitude in battling the harshest elements on earth to reach the South Pole before embarking on their ill-fated return is a story that has inspired many, including myself, for generations. I've always known it's a journey that sits at the very limits of human endurance -- hence my fascination and ambition to retrace and celebrate it. But it's only now as I follow in their footsteps that I can appreciate quite how tough it must have been.Speaking of suffering and deprivation, we're both hungrier than ever, which I wasn't expecting after the amount we re-fuelled following our resupply, but I suspect our bodies have so little fat or superfluous muscle they can turn into fuel that we're almost totally reliant on what we eat to keep us going now. Tarka commented today that dragging a sledge full of food around, and yet being hungry all day, is a pretty effective form of torture.In other news Tarka snapped one of his crampons today, so we've stopped early to repair it. It was a real shock and an undeniable setback -- especially as the crampons were among the few bits of our gear that have seemed bombproof and performed flawlessly so far -- but the repair looks solid, and we should be able to put in another big day tomorrow.As Tarka put it this evening (I've omitted several swear words to make his feelings suitable for a family audience):This place never gives you an inch, it never cuts you any slack and it always has to have the upper hand.

Of course, there was never any doubt about which hypothetical mine the report was aimed at: the Pebble Mine.Pebble, for those unfamiliar, is a massive copper and gold deposit worth potentially hundreds of billions of dollars that sits at the headwaters of two of Bristol Bay's primary river systems. Those river systems, in turn, support the world's largest run of sockeye salmon and a robust fishing economy that contributes $480 million annually and upwards of 14,000 full- and part-time jobs. It has also been the backbone of the region's subsistence-based Native culture for thousands of years. It's not surprising that many Bristol Bay stakeholders aren't thrilled by the prospect of a massive open pit mine and its attendant tailings dams, road corridors and other development.All of which helps explains why the project has become such a lightning rod -- it's the most controversial resource issue in Alaska and has attracted attention and opposition from well beyond the state. (For one example: see Robert Redford's take here). This study was initiated by a request from a group of Native tribes from the region, who approached the EPA in 2010 to ask that they block the mine's development by invoking section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. Now, over three years later, after gathering data, holding public meetings, receiving over a million comments, and putting the study through two rounds of peer review by panel of independent scientists, the EPA has arrived at this final document.In a conference call with reporters yesterday, EPA Region 10 Administrator Dennis McLerran had no answer for questions as to what sort of regulatory action the study might precipitate, or on what timeline, but on the findings of the assessment, he didn't mince words: \"EPA has concluded that large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed poses significant near and long-term risks to salmon, wildlife and native Alaskan cultures.\"Jeff Frithsen, a senior scientist and special projects manager at the EPA's office of research and development in D.C, summarized the litany of potential effects -- ecological, economic, cultural -- resulting from each of the three hypothetical mine scenarios outlined in the study. In each case, he cataloged the risks posed both from a mine's routine operations and from potentially more catastrophic accidents or failures. The potential effects of even standard mining operations, as outlined by Frithsen, included the loss of dozens of miles of streams and thousands of acres of wetlands, as well as unforeseeable impacts on the 64 rivers and streams that the mine's transportation corridor would cross. (I encourage you to download the executive summary here for all the details).Those who have been fighting against the mine were quick to endorse the study's findings. \"We are pleased that the EPA has come to the conclusion that large scale mine development in the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve would endanger and put at risk the most valuable fishery in the world,\" said Anders Gustafson, Executive Director of the Renewable Resources Coalition, one of the primary groups fighting Pebble, adding that the study contained \"exactly the kind of data\" that will be needed in evaluating the project and others like it.Of course, not everyone saw it that way. Northern Dynasty, the Canadian mining company developing Pebble, quickly issued its own press release titled, subtly, \"Northern Dynasty Acknowledges Completion of EPA's Flawed Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment.\"\"Publication of the final watershed assessment is really the final chapter in a very sad story,\" said Northern Dynasty CEO Ron Thiessen in the release. \"We believe the EPA set out to do a flawed analysis of the Pebble Project, and they certainly succeeded with both their first and second drafts of the BBWA.\"John Shively, CEO of the Pebble Partnership, the Alaska-based face of Pebble's development, concurred with Thiessen. \"We have maintained all along that the Bristol Bay watershed assessment process has been rushed and thus has resulted in two very flawed documents,\" Shively said in a release, saying that the EPA did not commit enough time or resources to do a thorough job, and he criticized the hypothetical mine scenarios. \"It must be remembered that the report does not assess the effects of the Pebble Project as we have not finalized nor submitted a project for regulatory evaluation.\" In Shively's eyes, without a mine plan from Pebble, the EPA is evaluating a fiction.The mine's opponents dismissed such critiques. \"If you don't like the outcome of the review, you are going to say it's bad data,\" Bristol Bay Native Corporation President Jason Metrokin told local TV station KTVA, while praising the process.Flawed or not, the assessment is now final, which means people on both sides of the Pebble debate have the same question: What now? It's clear where this report comes down on the mine -- a bad thing -- but there's no inkling of whether those conclusions will lead to policy action and, if so, on what sort of a timeline.The EPA has gone to great lengths to separate this phase -- the compilation and examination of the underlying scientific, economic and historical data --f rom any discussion of policy. In fact, page one of the report's executive summary says as much: \"As a scientific assessment, it does not discuss or recommend policy, legal or regulatory decisions, nor does it outline or analyze options for future decisions.\" The EPA's position is, effectively: Now that we've gathered the information, we can begin thinking about what to do with it and how to respond to the tribes' request for regulatory action.As it turns out, the situation may not be as urgent as it once seemed. After years of insisting that they were nearly ready to file for their mining permits -- \"by the end of the year\" was an oft-heard refrain -- the path forward for Pebble looks somewhat murkier. In September, Northern Dynasty's partner in the project, mini-giant Anglo-American, walked away from its 50 percent stake, taking a $300 million loss for its efforts and citing a need to streamline its mine development pipeline by focusing on lower risk mines with a higher probability of near-term payout. A month later, layoffs at Pebble began. And in December, global mining company Rio Tinto announced that it was reevaluating its 19 percent stake in Northern Dynasty, which represents its de facto investment in Pebble, with a possible eye on divesting.All that being said, this story is far from over. Northern Dynasty has vowed to press forward with the mine's development, likely with a new partner to replace Anglo American.\"The report does not change our plans,\" Mike Heatwole, spokesman for the Pebble Partnership, told me in an email. \"Our immediate focus remains on working with Northern Dynasty in securing a partner to help advance the project.\"Or, as a fisherman friend of mine commented after I posted a link to the EPA report, \"Well, the deposit isn't going anywhere, so we'll see where it goes from here!\""}, {"title": "Recovery from WV Coal Chemical Spill Continues - What Next?", "text": "As a West Virginian, this has been a sad, frustrating, and infuriating time for me, though I do not live in the area affected by last week's coal chemical spill. More than 300,000 people in the WV capital of Charleston and downstream counties have been without water for eight days and counting.The chemical that spilled is used to process coal after it's mined, to separate the coal from other substances before it's carried away on trains or river barges. A tank of this chemical, located immediately above the largest drinking water intake in WV, leaked. Very little is known about the chemical and its health effects - and WV officials are saying they also don't know where else in the state this chemical is stored.Some residents have been told they can start flushing out their water systems while others are still using bottled water for drinking, cooking and bathing. Even where the water is back on, it's undrinkable, forcing residents to continue their reliance on bottled and shipped in water -- an especially heavy burden on the areas poorest residents. In fact, \"do not use\" orders are being reissued in some places.Now the CDC is saying the test it used to determine \"safe\" levels of the leaked chemical humans can drink focused on the wrong chemical!What's more, on Wednesday, six days post-spill and after the water had been deemed \"safe\" in some areas, officials issued an advisory urging pregnant women to drink only bottled water. As the mom of a three-year-old, I can only imagine what a scary time this must be for all the new and expecting moms in the middle of this crisis.Earlier this week, I appeared on NPR's Diane Rehm Show to talk about the spill, along with the head of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a Washington Post reporter, and a staffer from an anti-regulatory think tank. A few people have told me that they were shocked and even brought to tears by the program, which you can listen to here.  The Sierra Club has a long-time organizer in Charleston -- Bill Price -- and, in the immediate aftermath of the spill, he has been working closely with allies on relief efforts to provide people with water. In some rural communities, volunteer water distribution has been the only relief for residents, believe it or not. Earlier this week we profiled one West Virginian who is part of that effort, Dustin White, to underscore that this crisis is a long way from over, and frankly highlight the continuing failure of the state to safeguard the health of its people.If you want to make a donation to help support the volunteer water distribution efforts still under way, you can donate to the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, and make a note that your gift is for the WV water crisis.  As I described on the Diane Rehm Show, this tragedy is a direct product of a regulatory system held hostage by the coal industry for decades. The site where the tank leaked hadn't been inspected by the state since 1991! In the state of the state address just days before the accident, the governor vowed to \"never back down from the Environmental Protection Agency because of its misguided policies on coal.\" In the immediate wake of the disaster, the governor has repeatedly asserted that the coal industry had nothing to do with this spill - which is like saying the tobacco industry has nothing to do with lung cancer.This spill pulls the curtain back on water problems that people in the Appalachian coalfields have been pleading for decades to have addressed. Each year, after this chemical and others are used to \"wash\" coal, billions of gallons of leftover slurry - a witches brew of chemicals and water - are typically either injected into old underground mines (which leaches into groundwater) or stored behind earthen dams, some of which are larger than the Hoover Dam.You can read more about the coal industry's threat to water in this article and others in the Charleston Gazette, whose reporter Ken Ward Jr. has been doing Pulitzer-caliber reporting on the spill, in my estimation. And I urge you to support the West Virginia-based organizations fighting this battle for clean water -- Keeper of the Mountains, the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, Coal River Mountain Watch, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, and Sierra Club West Virginia.   It's time to hold these polluters and decision-makers accountable, and to work to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again. A candlelight vigil is being planned for next Tuesday in Charleston, and allies around the country are planning their own events in solidarity.   Finally, you can take action now to tell President Obama that West Virginia leaders cannot be trusted to regulate the coal industry.This spill only underscores the coal industry's widespread use of dangerous chemicals, and the cost to Appalachian communities and mountains. If the WV Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) continues to turn a blind eye to polluters, President Obama should direct federal agencies to do the job the DEP will not do.Tell President Obama to step in and stand up for the health of West Virginia communities."}, {"title": "California Drought Emergency Declared By Governor Jerry Brown", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- California Gov. Jerry Brown spoke to reporters on Friday morning to declare a drought emergency for the state, which had its driest year in recorded history in 2013.\"Today I'm declaring a drought in the state of California,\" said Brown. \"We're facing perhaps the worst drought California has ever seen since records began being kept about 100 years ago.\"Brown's declaration was mostly symbolic. The governor called for a 20 percent voluntary reduction in water use for all citizens \"in both rural areas and cities.\" However, \"we're certainly holding out for mandatory conservation,\" he said.\"There's not a government program that can totally compensate for the lack of rain,\" he said. \"Hopefully it will rain eventually, but in the meantime we all have to do our part.\"Brown's decision comes after months of pressure from lawmakers to declare a drought. The official announcement could affect how California's water is distributed and provide the basis for setting formal guidelines for farmers, businesses and residents to cut back.The governor presented a graph showing the year's dismal precipitation, as well as photos comparing the Sierra Nevada snowpack today versus one year ago.The culprit of the drought is a massive high-pressure zone off the West Coast that has been blocking Pacific storms for over a year. Eleven states including Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Kansas, Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Oklahoma and California have already been designated primary natural disaster areas by federal inspectors due to the drought.At a press conference earlier this week, Brown signaled the announcement would be coming.\"It's coming within the next few days,\" he said. \"But don't think that a letter from the governor's office is going to affect the rain.\""}, {"title": "Climate, Civil Rights and Dr. King", "text": "I participated in the \"Poor People's March\" organized by Dr. Martin Luther King and held in Washington D.C. in June 1968 in the aftermath of his assassination. I also participated in the \"Pray in for Climate\" organized by the Interfaith Moral Action on Climate (IMAC) to honor the 85th birthday of Dr. King in Washington D.C. on January 15, 2014. Extreme weather events associated with climate change affect poor communities the most, although their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is much less than those of the richest communities. In the spirit of Dr. King, activists are increasingly calling for \"climate justice\" and \"freedom from fossil fuels.'\" It is likely that if Dr. King were alive, he would be a leader of the growing climate and environmental justice movement today.Dr. King was not simply a leader of the African-American or the Christian communities. He struggled for freedom from oppression for all communities. His definition of civil liberties was not limited to due process of law, equal protection, and freedom from discrimination. It encompassed economic justice. Identifying the interconnected problems of \"racism, poverty, militarism, and materialism,\" he called for the \"reconstruction of society itself\" as the foundation for civil rights.If he were alive today, Dr. King would recognize that in the absence of governmental leadership, time for effective action on climate is running out. He would emphasize the \"fierce urgency\" of environmental protection and the right to clean air, water, and soil as civil and human rights of all. He would remind us that \"evil flourishes when good people do nothing.\" He would exhort us to non-violent action to protect the environment to support life on Earth. Dr. King would approach the climate and the environment from a fundamentally moral and spiritual standpoint, as he did civil liberties and economic justice.Inspired by the words and activism of Dr. King, IMAC has called upon leaders of all religious and faith organizations in the U.S. to provide moral leadership to address the climate emergency. Along with other climate protection movements around the country, IMAC demands a number of urgent actions from the U.S. government. These include calls on President Obama to use his executive powers to regulate carbon emissions and to ensure that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement (which consists of 12 countries including the U.S., Japan, Australia, Mexico, and Canada) does not undermine the environment and efforts to address the climate crisis. Another call is for the U.S. to provide serious financial support to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate disruption on the poorest and most vulnerable nations. Climate activists also want President Obama to deny outright all construction permits for the Keystone Tar Sands Pipeline, tar-oil being among the most dangerous of the planet-heating forms of carbon.Unfortunately, the Obama administration is not heeding to these demands. Unlike some northern European countries, the United States is yet to place a price on carbon or introduce a carbon tax. A leaked draft of the TPP Agreement reveals that it lacks fully enforceable safeguards to protect the environment including wildlife and natural resources. The recent COP 19 (Conference of the Parties) held in Warsaw on the climate fell far short of the detailed funding commitment expected by poor countries from the developed nations including the United States. Notwithstanding growing environmental concerns, the Obama administration has not backed off from the Keystone XL Pipeline either. The TransCanada oil and gas corporation expects to start the Southern Leg of the Keystone Pipeline on January 22, 2014.Although the U.S. government has failed to heed environmental and moral injunctions, the non-governmental civil society sector is making rapid and important strides in addressing climate change. One important initiative in this regard is the emerging divestment movement. Two hundred publicly-traded companies hold the vast majority of listed coal, oil, and gas reserves in the U.S. Divestment activists want these companies to stop exploring for new hydrocarbons, stop lobbying for special advantages in Washington and state capitols across the country and pledge to keep 80 percent of their current reserves underground. The activists see unmitigated use of fossil fuels as a moral issue: \"It is wrong to wreck the climate... it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.\"Following the precedent set by the anti-apartheid divestment movement to support civil and human rights in South Africa, today's climate activists are seeking to shift financial investments away from fossil fuel companies and reinvest in institutions that support clean, renewable energy technologies. The successes of this new divestment movement is hardly ever reported in the mainstream news media. Yet, as a young activist from Greenfaith read a long list of colleges and universities, cities, counties, religious institutions, and other organizations around the country that have divested money from fossil fuel companies, the power of citizen organizing became apparent to those present at the \"Pray in for Climate.\" A few activists there engaged in non-violent civil disobedience to protest the southern wing of the Keystone Pipeline while others sang songs of inspiration, bringing to memory earlier marches on Washington for freedom and justice. Dr. Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" remains alive guiding the struggle for freedom and survival of humanity and Mother Earth of which we are all a part:\"And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire."}, {"title": "Finding the Promise in Promise Zones, Part 2", "text": "If a region's strategy for economic renewal was turned over to its people rather than controlled by its traditional power brokers, what would be the result?One example grew from a project that Oberlin College Prof. David Orr and I participated in several years ago in Central Appalachia. Supported by philanthropist Adam Lewis, we worked with individuals and organizations committed to diversifying the economy of coal country and to finding alternatives to mountain top removal coal mining. We called it the Central Appalachia Prosperity Project.Getting large numbers of people to agree on anything falls somewhere between challenging and impossible, but over the course of 12 months the project produced 50 pages of ideas for greening and diversifying the mountain economy. It also produced 10 principles that were endorsed by many of the region's citizen leaders and civic organizations. Among them were Appalachian Voices, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, the Mountain Area Association for Community Economic Development, Downstream Strategies, Berea College, the Center for Rural Strategies, the Appalachian Community Fund, the Brushy Fork Institute, the Kentucky Foundation for Women, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises, the Center for Rural Entrepreneurship, the JOBS Project and the West Virginia Economic Justice Project, along with individuals whose defense of the region's mountains and culture is nothing short of heroic.The principles, reproduced here verbatim, are worth the attention of Obama Administration's Promise Zone initiative:1. The principal goal of economic development in Central Appalachia is to build, secure and sustain the genuine prosperity of its people. Economic development in Central Appalachia must achieve prosperity in the fullest sense of that term, including a strong economy; a rich cultural heritage; a vibrant entrepreneurial sprit; a skilled, healthy and educated populace; robust social and natural resources; and communities that serve the spirit and the aspirations of their people.2. Economic development must meet the needs of the region's people today while preserving the capacity of future Appalachians to meet their needs. This principle embodies the definition of sustainable development created by the United Nation's Brundtland Commission in 1987. It expresses an ethic critical to human progress at the local as well as global level: striving for true prosperity today in ways that protect the resources and conditions future generations will need to achieve an equal or better quality of life.3. The people of Central Appalachia will seek to protect, sustain and enrich their human, natural and cultural capital. The capital necessary for genuine prosperity takes many forms - financial, social, cultural, physical, natural and ecological. Appalachian workers who have dedicated their lives to the nation's energy needs. Farmers, forest workers, producers of wood products, artists and musicians - these are just a few examples of the region's rich human capital. Other vital capital includes a modern education system; clean energy, water and air; a safe, sound and modern built environment; and abundant natural resources. All of these are critical to a robust and sustainable economy.4. Economic development policies and programs should promote a diverse mix of business, industry and job opportunities appropriate to the conditions, markets, culture and needs of the 21st century. Economic strength will be found in diversity. Central Appalachia will build a stronger economy when it nurtures diverse economic opportunities that respond to and thrive in the new realities of this century - among them, an unprecedented market for clean energy technologies in the United States and worldwide, an urgent need for environmental technologies and services, and the imperative for businesses and jobs that optimize economy, environment and equity. The first great challenge America faces in this new century is to make economic development compatible with healthy families, communities and natural systems. Appalachia should be a pioneer in demonstrating how that goal can be achieved.At the same time, farming, forestry, wood production and other land-based enterprises should remain a vital part of the Appalachian economy, providing food, fiber and the materials used in housing and the build environment. These enterprises are grounded in generations of practice that now can be improved with our new understandings of sustainable agriculture and forest-management practices. They represent an immediate place to begin the transition to a carbon-sequestering, community-building economy that uses familiar skills, reduces transaction distances and costs, and enhances self-reliance.5. Regional development should create educational, recreational, cultural and career opportunities for young people. Economic development plans and programs should involve the young people who represent the future of Central Appalachia. Building educational, cultural, recreational and career opportunities for young people is essential to the region's prosperity, encouraging new generations to build their families and lives in the region.6. Political and economic power should be shared in Central Appalachia to strengthen diversity. Economic development strategies must be created in collaboration with the diverse array of people, industries and communities they are meant to serve. Community planners and economic development agencies in Central Appalachia should adhere to the principles of open government and create ample opportunities for civic engagement in planning. Public officials should clearly show how public input is used. In addition, residents of the region should increase their political and economic power to guide Appalachia's future by incorporating their communities, increasing their ownership of land and resources, and recreating locally owned lending and investment institutions.7. Economic development should increase the self-sufficiency, health, well-being, safety and dignity of the people of Central Appalachia. Locally owned enterprises are key to the region's sustainable prosperity. While attracting industries from outside the region can be important, creating local enterprises is a jobs and economic development strategy over which communities have much greater control.8. The region should optimize the sustainable use of its natural resources. Appalachia is one of the most beautiful regions of the world. Its natural environment offers an array of ecosystem services and economic benefits ranging from medicinal herbs and non-timber forest products to opportunities for residents and visitors to hike, camp, hunt, fish, raft and experience the power of nature to restore body, mind and spirit. These resources are one of the region's richest assets. Those who manage them must be careful not to confuse \"optimize\" with \"maximize\". Wise stewardship of Appalachia's rich natural resources is vital to the region's prosperity.9. Economic equity, environmental justice and equal opportunity must be pillars of economic development in the region. Appalachia's history of social struggle - for example, the struggle of mine workers and unions to improve working conditions within the coal industry - underscores the importance of equity, equality and justice in a sustainable society. All ethnic groups, income levels, workers and geographic areas in Central Appalachia should enjoy equal opportunity for prosperity and should become active stakeholders in the region's well being. No community, profession or group should be expected to bear disproportionate costs of economic activity.10. While the people of Central Appalachia create new markets and income, the value of \"non-market\" production should not be underestimated or lost. A rich part of the region's tradition is the work of homesteaders, homemakers and neighbors who provide goods and services for one another without pay. Local production, self-sufficiency and the willingness of neighbor to help neighbor add strength and resilience to the economy. Appalachia's non-market goods and services, beyond the usual metrics of employment, wages and gross regional product, should be among the factors used to measure its economic success and its wealth.A region's native intelligence, spirit, cultural memory and deep commitment to the future exist in people and organizations like these. They are the real promise in Promise Zones. That's why the Obama Administration should make transparency, vision, broad and ongoing citizen participation. and the democratic disposition of resources conditions of the assistance it offers to America's impoverished places."}, {"title": "Game Over? Obama Gifts Big Coal $1 Billion for FutureGen in Illinois", "text": "In the same days an entrepreneur went on federal trial for fraud over an unproven \"clean coal\" scheme, President Obama's Department of Energy gave a game-changing approval for a $1 billion gift to continue the unproven FutureGen \"clean coal\" boondoggle in Illinois.Kind of ironic, ain't it -- if it weren't so tragic.On the heels of the West Virginia coal-cleaning chemical disaster, with Illinois residents already besieged by a toxic coal rush that has seen production increase by an estimated 70 percent in the last few years, amid record climate disruptions and drought and flooding, this billion dollar bonus to Big Coal might signal \"game over\" for clean energy and climate initiatives in the heartland -- or at least Illinois.According to the DOE \"record of decision,\" the project \"would support the ongoing and future use of the nation's abundant coal reserves in a manner that addresses both aging power plants and environmental challenges.\"  \"Clean coal is an essential component of the President's \"All of the Above\" energy strategy and the proposed project would help DOE meet its congressionally-mandated mission to support advanced clean-coal technologies,\" the DOE added.According to the Energy Information Administration, coal production -- and its disastrous fallout of coal slurry, black lung disease and clean water contamination -- in the Illinois Basin should surpass the central Appalachian coal fields by the end of the decade.Too bad neighboring Iowa can't take over Illinois -- yes Iowa, a state that has taken the lead in the multi-billion-dollar wind industry, making it as competitive in the market as dirty coal.Illinois, meanwhile, continues to lose nearly $20 million annually to maintain the state coal industry, according to a study last year.And hardly a single green job designated for southern Illinois' struggling economy.Last spring, the Congressional Research Service issued their own concerns about the viability of FutureGen's carbon capture and storage plans:Nearly ten years and two restructuring efforts since FutureGen's inception, the project is still in its early development stages. Although the Alliance completed drilling a characterization well at the storage site in Morgan County, IL, and installed a service rig over the well for further geologic analysis, issues with the power plant itself have not yet been resolved.Other countries, like Norway, have abandoned the CCS boondoggles after years of planning.In Illinois, instead, residents in coal mining areas -- not unproven CCS technologies -- have been abandoned. Check out a few recent examples of \"clean energy\" champion Gov. Pat Quinn's defining coal legacy in the last year:--Quinn appointees granted a pollution waiver to five aging and toxin-spewing coal-fired plants last fall--Federal authorities were called in last week, in order to force state officials to stop turning a blind eye on illegal logging and controversial strip mining operations in Saline County  --Despite 600-plus Clean Water Act violations, the state renewed the permit for a strip mining operation in central Illinois--Despite farmer and town resident petitions over possible safety violations, the state has allowed high hazard coal slurry dams to be built inside the limits of Hillsboro--Despite record drought, flooding and climate disruptions, Quinn has championed the five-fold increase of dirty coal exports down the impacted Mississippi River--Abandoned mines continue to threaten and leach toxic discharges into unprotected communities, farms and forestsA Saline County resident said it best this week, with a strip mining threatening his community's future and clean water: \"Our problem is we've got tornadoes and floods, but this is a man-made disaster,\" he said. \"We are trying to protect our homes and neighbors.\""}, {"title": "Finding the Promise in Promise Zones, Part 1", "text": "President Obama's designation of five localities as Promise Zones is the latest in a long history of efforts by his predecessors to wage the war on poverty in communities where the war is needed most.It's a good idea, if it is done well. It would make little sense to put new financial resources into the same strategies and power structures that have created and perpetuated the poverty that exists in parts of the United States today.The Promise Zone initiative is starting small. Federal resources permitting, it has the potential to be a productive new campaign in the war on poverty that President Lyndon Johnson declared a half-century ago. It is reminiscent of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Zone programs under the Clinton Administration. Then as now, the idea was to give special tax breaks and treatment in grant competitions to neighborhoods, communities and regions that are struggling economically and socially.Today, however, there are new factors in the mix. One is global warming. Its impacts often stress the communities and people least able to cope because they lack resources. The resources in insufficient supply are not only money, but also \"natural capital\" including important ecosystem services that have disappeared because of environmental degradation. Those services range from flood control to water purification. One way to address poverty is to help communities restore their natural capital.If the Promise Zone program continues, it could also address economic stress in those communities whose prosperity now depends on the production of carbon-rich energy and whose boom will become bust as the United States makes the transition to clean and renewable energy resources.The program will need to redefine what constitutes a good business climate. A community that lacks adequate fresh water supplies, or whose energy supplies are unreliable, or whose public health is threatened by bad air quality, or that's highly vulnerable to extreme weather events probably is not a good prospect for new businesses and jobs.For those reasons, the Obama Administration's program should help struggling communities achieve not just economic development, but rather sustainable development. That means development strategies that recognize how ample supplies of clean locally produced energy, fresh water resources, healthy ecosystem services, and resilience against extreme weather events are as vital to a local economy as educated workers, affordable taxes and good transportation systems.One useful formula for economic revitalization was devised years ago by Michael Kinsley at the Rocky Mountain Institute. It consists of four simple sequential strategies for restoring the health of struggling communities.First, jettison the idea that the best way to create jobs is to recruit outside companies. This is the lottery approach to development because relatively few new industrial plants are built in the United States each year and few communities succeed in the competition to host them. The first objective should be to plug leaks in the local economy.One such leak is the loss of energy dollars because of poorly insulated buildings, car-dependent and poorly planned transportation systems, inefficient municipal services or excessive dependence on energy from other places. By one estimate, about 75 cents of every energy dollar immediately leaves a leaky locality. Every retained dollar, on the other hand, produces a multiplier effect. In other words, it creates several times its value as people spend it on local goods and services.Second, create the conditions that help existing businesses thrive. For example, aggressive energy efficiency efforts by local governments can lower or slow the growth of property taxes.Third, identify value-added opportunities in the community - opportunities to make things from local resources rather than exporting raw materials. It's better for timber to leave a community as furniture than as logs, for example.Fourth, go ahead and enter the national lottery for recruiting new companies to town. The first three steps will make the community more competitive.There is a fifth important strategy beyond the RMI formula: Involve local people in deciding what prosperity means, how it would be best achieved and how incoming resources should be targeted and managed. In some communities, powerful special interests control resources to serve their own ends. They are vested in and work to perpetuate the patterns that created poverty in the first place.Appalachia comes to mind. The coal industry largely controls the political system there. The region's poverty has deep roots, including the fact that much of the land and its minerals are owned by outsiders - absentee landowners who bought land and mineral rights for pennies generations ago. Mountain top removal mining is causing cultural poverty because the region's hills and biodiversity are a large part of its soul.In many American communities, poverty is not simply a matter of money and the solution to poverty isn't either. Well-intentioned federal programs, which have yet to succeed in places such as Appalachia, need to identify and focus on poverty's deep roots, and they need to democratize the planning and control of economic, social, cultural, human and environmental development.

He noted that after the environmental analysis is completed there will be a process to determine whether building the pipeline is in the U.S. national interest.Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird bluntly told the United States on Thursday to end the \"limbo\" on the approval process for the pipeline, conceding that Washington might veto the project. On Friday, a spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he still believed the United States would ultimately approve the project, which would transport crude from the Alberta oil sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.The U.S. State Department has yet to finalize a controversial environmental review of more than 2,000 pages that it issued on March 1. It had been expected to complete the review by midsummer.Instead, it is reviewing and publishing in batches the more than 1.5 million public comments it received on the review.Many of the comments focus on one of the draft review's main conclusions: that TransCanada Corp's 830,000 barrel per day project would not result in higher levels of emissions linked to global warming because the oil would find its way to market whether or not the pipeline gets built.\"There were a lot of questions that were raised in all of the public comment period and those comments have necessitated appropriate answers,\" Kerry said. \"I can promise our friends in Canada that, you know, all the appropriate effort is being put in to trying to get this done effectively and rapidly.\"After the environmental review is completed, eight federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy and Homeland Security, will have 90 days to comment on whether they believe the pipeline is in the national interest. Then the State Department will make a National Interest Determination (NID), which the agencies will have 15 days to appeal.Baird, standing at Kerry's side after a three-way meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade, suggested he and the U.S. secretary of state would discuss the issue during a bilateral meeting later on Friday.\"Obviously, this is a tremendously important project for the future prosperity of the Canadian economy,\" he told reporters at the news conference. \"We hope the final State Department report is out in short order and that the administration will be in a position to make a positive decision.\""}, {"title": "Python Swallows Antelope Whole (VIDEO)", "text": "No chewing is required for this dangerous snake.As a film crew trekking through Botswana's Moremi Game Reserve recently saw firsthand, the African rock python is able to swallow its prey whole.

Last fall, California passed the first statewide energy storage directive in the United States. Issued by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the mandate requires all investor-owned utilities in the state including Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric, to jointly purchase \"1325 megawatts of energy storage\" by 2020.\"The proposed targets increase between 30 percent and 55 percent every two years, creating economic incentives for multiple players with various technologies to enter the market reports Energy Storage North America in a press release:   -- \"Utilities will be allowed to employ energy storage for a variety of functions, such as capacity, ancillary services, and peak shaving, which in turn will provide real-world data for further market expansion.\"-- \"Utilities may own some energy storage systems, and will procure at least 50% from independent developers across all segments of the grid via existing procurement processes or \"all-source\" solicitations starting in 2014.\"California's PUC is clearly progressive and groundbreaking and sets the stage for other states to emulate. Next up at the plate as a hot, receptive market for energy storage in North America is New York. Bill Acker, Executive Director of the New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology Consortium, www.ny-best.org, is positioning New York State as a global leader in energy storage technology, including applications in grid storage, transportation and power electronics.Last summer, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced a $23 million public-private investment in the creation of a battery storage test and commercialization center in partnership with NY-BEST which moved state-of-the-art energy storage testing capabilities from Pennsylvania to a facility at the Eastman Business Park in Rochester, New York. A few months later, the Governor's office announced that the NOHMs Technologies is locating its pilot nanoscale battery materials manufacturing facility in Rochester and received $1.5 million in funding from the Governor's Regional Economic Development Councils initiative.\"The key to powering our economic growth is expanding our energy infrastructure,\" said Governor Cuomo at his 2012 State of the State Address. \"We can build a new energy system across our entire State.\" Cuomo spearheaded the New York Energy Highway Blueprint which includes initiatives to modernize New York's statewide energy system.In his State of the State speech in Albany this month, the Governor and Vice President Biden championed community based microgrid solutions as part of his \"Reimagining New York for a New Reality\" initiative which is a $17 billion strategy that will transform the state's energy supply, infrastructure, emergency management, etc., to protect people from future extreme weather. \"Our plan completely transforms the way we build and protect our infrastructure, safeguard our energy supply, prepare our citizens and first responders, and provide fuel and electricity,\" said Governor Cuomo. Cuomo's mandate to launch new projects across the state that both create green jobs and protect New York's natural environment is a critical economic reform in this year's budget.\"Community grids protect people, businesses and infrastructure from the devastation of extreme weather and from extended power outages, as were experienced following Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee,\" said Jim Gallagher, Executive Director, New York State Smart Grid Consortium.In December 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy released a Grid Energy Storage report which examined the challenges and solutions for energy storage technology development and widespread installation. Ensuring safety and cost sensitive pricing were key issues addressed in this report. This report clearly signals to me that the U.S. government clearly wants to create a substantial energy storage marketplace and is laying the groundwork to make this a reality."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Study Says United States Tops List of Global Warming Offenders", "text": "A new study by Canadian researchers finds the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, and developing nations Brazil and India were responsible for more than 60 percent of global temperature changes between 1906 and 2005. The U.S. alone was responsible for 22 percent of the warning; China followed at 9 percent and Russia at 8 percent. Brazil and India each contributed 7 percent; the U.K. and Germany were each responsible for 5 percent. The findings, authors said, are particularly important for diplomats working toward a deal in 2015 to limit emissions.\"A clear understanding of national contributions to climate warming provides important information with which to determine national responsibility for global warming, and can therefore be used as a framework to allocate future emissions,\" researchers said in their paper, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.To restrict warming to U.N. targets of 2 degrees Celsius, rising world emissions would need to drop 40 to 70 percent by 2050, Reuters reports. U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said number two historic emitter China is taking the right steps to address global warming with its energy-efficiency standards for buildings and other renewable energy commitments. In the U.S. carbon emissions from energy fell 12 percent between 2005 and 2012, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates a 2 percent increase in these emissions in 2013.Global Energy Demand Growth, Renewable Investment SlowingGlobal energy consumption continues to grow, but slowly. The fourth annual edition of the BP Energy Outlook 2035 pegged growth at 41 percent compared with 55 percent the last 23 years. Although demand from emerging economies is predicted to rise steadily, energy demand elsewhere will slow through 2035.The U.S., the report said, will be able to provide for its own energy needs in the next two decades with the acceleration of shale oil and gas production. Natural gas, in particular, will overtake oil as the country's most used fuel as early as 2027--accounting for 35 percent of U.S. consumption by 2035. Oil, however, will be the slowest growing of the major fuels with demand rising on average 0.8 percent annually. Still, U.S. oil imports are expected to drop 75 percent through 2035.In Europe, the energy market is predicted to rise just 5 percent by 2030 and to become more dependent on imports of gas. China's energy production will rise 61 percent with consumption growing 71 percent by 2035.The release of BP's Energy Outlook comes the same day Bloomberg New Energy Finance revealed that global investment in clean energy fell 12 percent last year.\"Global investment in clean energy was USD 254 billion last year, down from a revised USD 288.9 billion in 2012 and the record USD 317.9 billion of 2011,\" a release from Bloomberg stated. In Japan, clean energy investment spiked as a result of small-scale solar installations.RGGI States Reduce Emission Cap in 2014States participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) dropped their carbon dioxide emissions cap for power plants 45 percent for 2014 to 91 million tons. The initiative, which partners New York, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, aims to reduce these states' power plant pollution by half of 2005 levels.\"RGGI has once again proven that state leadership provides the laboratory for innovation,\" said Kenneth Kimmell, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and RGGI chair. \"RGGI is a cost-effective and flexible program that can serve as a national model for dramatically reducing carbon pollution for other states throughout the nation.\"Within the program, each power plant is assigned an amount of carbon dioxide it can release, but the plants can buy and sell allowances to increase or decrease their emissions. At the first allowance auction under the new limits March 5, states will offer up 18.6 million carbon dioxide allowances.Appellate court arguments surrounding New Jersey's 2011 exit from the trading program began this week.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

Union local President James Slevin huddled with mediators from the U.S. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service after angrily leaving the contract discussions.\"The company doesn't seem like it's ready to get serious about negotiating a fair contract,\" said UWU spokesman John Melia. \"They haven't put anything on the table except takeaways and a regressive offer. It doesn't seem like they are ready to negotiate in good faith. It seems as if Entergy is trying to provoke a labor dispute.\"They have a pattern of doing this. They are very anti-labor and have a mindset that every shareholder should get rich and no one else.\"Melia referred to the five-week lockout by Entergy of UWU members at its Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Massachusetts in June, 2012. The lockout occurred during negotiations and after union leaders had agreed to two contract extensions so the talks could continue without a plant interruption. At the time of the lockout, Entergy was demanding concessions in pay, benefits, health care, and work rules. The final contract included 3 percent raises for the unionized workers.Entergy representatives declined to comment Thursday. Neither of the parties nor the mediators are publicly discussing contract specifics. However, Entergy is believed to be seeking -- at least in its initial stage of discussions -- wage cuts and increased employee contributions to health care.\"That was a calculated risk at Pilgrim outside of Boston,\" said Melia, \"and a bigger risk outside New York City. If you think these guys out of the Louisiana swamps want to roll the dice in the biggest metropolitan area of the United States, then they just brought Duck Dynasty to Buchanan, New York. It feels like they are saying 'those Yankees, you know how they are.'\"They talk about how they do things down there in the South as if the country is still as divided as it was 160 years ago.\"If there is a strike or lockout, Entergy has prepared a work plan using primarily non-union management. That sort of replacement is easier at the twin Indian Point plants than at Entergy's smaller, single reactor Pilgrim plant. There were some 1,500 union workers at Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 when Entergy bought the power plants from the New York Power Authority and Con Edison in 2001. Entergy shed union positions in its consolidation of the two separate facilities, and now there are just 395 UWU employees.-- Continue reading at Energy Matters."}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: Congressional Climateers, Weather on the Mind, and More!", "text": "Today the Earth got a little hotter.Via The Climate Reanalyzer here How unusual has the weather been? Looking above at recent temperature anomalies around the globe, we still have that unusually warm, high pressure ridge that's been sitting for months now off the west US coast, blocking cloud formation and keeping the west in drought, and extending unusually warm conditions thru Canada into Alaska. Another unusually warm area extends along much of the US eastern seaboard, into the Atlantic, and all the way up to the north pole. Unusually cold conditions surround the pole over Eurasia, with patches of slightly unusual cold through the mid US. Daily updates can be seen here.Record Cold Arctic Outbreak Tied to Global Warming say scientists reports Terrell Johnson at The Weather Channel. Basically, as global warming melts the Arctic faster than elsewhere (called Arctic Amplification), the temperature difference between Arctic and equator decreases, weakening the jetstream, which then slows and dips much further south. Thus, it delivered a persistent Arctic dose of record cold recently to the US; imagine what further warming might do....As the Arctic warms faster than elsewhere, the jet stream weakens, slows, and gets much wavier, deliviering more extreme weather to the US and elsewhere.

Lose yourself in the 11 facts below that are just as mesmerizing as the ethereal creatures themselves.1. Jellyfish have been around for more than 500 million years, making them possibly one of the oldest species on Earth.2. Different species of jellyfish can be found in every ocean in the world.Jellyfish have adapted to all types of waters from warm shallow waters, all the way to the bottomless depths of the sea.3. Not all jellyfish sting.Jellyfish Lake in Palau is filled with millions of nontoxic golden jellyfish that spend their days migrating with the movement of the sun.4. The ones that do sting use very small, toxic stinging cells called nematocysts.Some jellyfish have millions of nematocysts in their tentacles, which they use to capture their prey. When humans are stung, the toxins are painfully absorbed through the skin.5. Box jellyfish's venom is considered the most deadly in the world.Its toxins attack the heart, nervous system and skin cells. A box jellyfish sting is so painful that humans have been known to go into shock and drown or die of heart failure after being stung.6. Jellyfish have no brain, bones or heart.They are actually not really a fish at all. Jellyfish are relatives of anemones and corals, and are considered invertebrate animals because they do not have a spine or backbone.7. The Lion's mane jellyfish is the world's largest species of jellyfish.It can reach up to 8 feet in diameter. The largest recorded Lion's mane jellyfish had tentacles reaching up to 120 feet long.8. This is the world's smallest jellyfish. It's also the most deadly.The Irukandji jellyfish, or Common Kingslayer, can deliver a sting that is 100 times as potent as a cobra's and 1,000 times as strong as a tarantula.9. Carnivorous anemones eat jellyfish by trapping it in its tentacles and devouring it slowly.At :55 in the video above, watch as a Lion's mane jellyfish is \"reeled in and eaten alive by \"a hundred hungry mouths.\"10. The box jellyfish has 24 eyes, grouped in clusters of six across its bell.11. There is a type of \"immortal\" jellyfish that ages backwards.When the Turritopsis dohrnii is near death due to crises such as starvation or physical damage, it transforms itself into a younger state, \u00e0 la Benjamin Button."}, {"title": "House Republicans Pick Climate Skeptic To Head Environment Subcommittee", "text": "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans selected Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), who is on the record questioning whether humans are causing climate change, to head of the Science Committee's environment subcommittee.Schweikert will replace Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), who moved to the House Appropriations Committee. He said he plans to use his new post to target the Obama administration's regulatory agenda.\"Too often, this Administration has tried to bypass Congress and impose its will on the American people through regulatory fiat,\u201d Schweikert said Thursday in a statement, The Hill reported. \u201cWe have a responsibility to provide a check-and-balance to ensure there is fairness and openness in the process and that taxpayers are not being subjected to onerous and unnecessarily burdensome rules and regulations.\"A main component of the Obama administration's environmental work is new limits on power plants' greenhouse gas pollution. Schweikert has argued that the idea of man-made global warming may be \"folklore.\"\"Understanding what part of climate change is part of a natural cycle and what part has human components is the first step,\" he said as a candidate in 2008. \"Our elected officials must be careful to react to facts and not folklore.\" In a Facebook post last year, however, Schweikert seemed to indicate that reducing carbon dioxide emissions might be a good thing -- while bashing President Barack Obama's efforts to do so. He wrote on June 25:In light of Obama's 'climate change' speech today, I would like to REMIND him that at the time of its expiration, the Kyoto Protocol mandated that developed nations reduce their CO2 output by an average of 5.2%. Though we never ratified the Kyoto protocol, our country was able to REDUCE CO2 through new technology in the private sector, NOT top-down, economic crushing government mandates.The Kyoto Protocol is the international treaty on climate change that took effect in 2004, which the United States declined to join. A significant portion of the reduction in emissions that the U.S. has achieved since then is due to rising consumption of natural gas, which is noted in a blog post that Schweikert linked to in his post. That, and the recession.Schweikert will have good company in Science Committee leadership. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) is also a climate change denier.Democrats criticized the appointment.\"Every time we think congressional Republicans have proven they\u2019re completely out of touch with reality, they go and outdo themselves,\" said Josh Schwerin, press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"By putting a climate change denier in charge of a subcommittee on the environment, congressional Republicans are further cementing the fact that their only real priority is protecting special interests and their big oil backers.\""}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - January 16, 2014", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport FACEBOOK: Green News Report The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Unprecedented drought & wildfires in California; Unprecedented heat shuts down Australian Open; EPA smacks down Alaska's proposed Pebble Mine; Putting all the sh*t in Washington DC to good use!; PLUS: The impacts of the toxic chemical spill in West Virginia still flowing ...

They are able to do this without public accountability because, currently, trade associations aren't required to disclose their funders and corporations are not required to disclose their political spending. The report's author makes clear that in the crucial arena of climate change policy, \"the public is still in the dark when it comes to how companies and their trade associations influence government decisions.\"There is a simple way to start to fix this lack of transparency and accountability. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) should proceed with its rule making that would require companies to disclose their political activities. While 650,000 Americans of all stripes, including leading investors, have filed a record breaking number of comments supporting this common sense rule, 29 trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber and National Association of Manufacturers, wrote to the agency opposing the proposed rule. Last month, the SEC removed consideration of the rule from its 2014 agenda.The UCS study recommends that the SEC take action on the rule, and demonstrates why such a rule is so necessary to combat climate change. The study examines major corporations' responses to an annual survey about their political activities and compares them to the stances of trade associations they support. The study finds that these organizations often hold extreme positions on climate change that are not consistent with the expressed preferences of the companies that fund them. It also finds that many companies did not disclose their positions on a trade association, even when publicly available information shows they are on the association's board. Ninety-five companies reported that one or more of the trade groups they supported had a climate policy that was not consistent with their own.As SEC Commissioner Aguilar has explained, \"shareholders require uniform disclosures regarding corporate political expenditures for many reasons, including that it is impossible to have any corporate accountability or oversight without it.\" A Drexel University study released last December finds that the climate denial movement consists of 91 organizations supported by 140 primarily conservative foundations but that 75% of the funds for the climate denial movement is completely untraceable. These two studies both point to the importance of a U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) rule to require that companies disclose their political activities.Of the 9,136 peer-reviewed authors who published a paper about climate change between Nov. 12, 2012 through December 31, 2013 only one rejected anthropogenic global warming. The one dissenting author, Russian scientist S.V. Avakyan, appears to be motivated by a desire to maintain Russia's dominance as an oil and gas exporter. At this point, denying climate change is like denying the harmful effects of smoking -- only someone with a commercial interest would even question the data.Given the drastic costs to companies that could occur if the carbon bubble is popped through government action, it's unsurprising that trade associations are lobbying heavily against regulation. It's important to bring these trade associations out of the dark so that the public can know what companies are funding spurious climate research and policy. Without transparency there can be no accountability, and the SEC should move forward with the rule-making to require disclosure of corporate political activities."}, {"title": "It's So Hot In Australia Right Now That Lions Are Being Fed Frozen Blood (PHOTO)", "text": "As a record-breaking heat wave roasted Australia this week, a lion at the Melbourne Zoo kept cool by licking a bloody treat:According to the caption that accompanied this Rex USA photograph, which has gone viral this week, Harari the lion was given the special popsicle, made from eight gallons of blood, to beat the 115-degree heat on Tuesday.Staff at the Melbourne Zoo also fed frozen treats to the facility's other animals to help keep them cool, Australia's Newcastle Herald reports.

The situation is too dire -- extreme weather from a changing climate, toxins in our food, endangered species dying off -- for this to be a laughing matter. At least, that's our reputation: Serious, earnest, humorless.The reputation is partly deserved. Most environmental activists take their work very seriously. We see huge problems facing our world, and know that human lives are at stake. Take a look at this new study from the National Academy of Science, about the abrupt impacts of climate change, and you'll know why. When you focus on issues that are so serious, it's easy to slip into taking yourself too seriously.It's a condition you find with activists across the ideological spectrum, many of whom feel like they're in an uphill struggle to do what they think is right. Tea Partiers, Wall Street Occupiers, and proponents on both sides of the abortion debate often come off as stern and unamused. Or they're happy to laugh, as long as the joke is on their ideological opponents.If you believe what you're doing is important, it's certainly good to take your work seriously. But it becomes a problem when you imply that your mission is more important than what's going on in other people's lives. And even worse, when you get the reputation for being irritating, it becomes harder to get support for your cause or grow your movement.The good news is that this reputation is far from a full picture of people who work on conservation issues. If you spend time with environmental activists, you'll find that most of us don't fit the stereotype. We won't scold you for driving the wrong car* or turning up the heat on a cold day, and we probably tell more jokes about ourselves than any else. (Q: How do electric car owners drive? A: One hand on the wheel, the other patting themselves on the back.)Sure, some of this perception problem is the result of unfair caricature, but it is a real problem. The reality is that environmentalists often have a difficult time reaching the people with whom we most need to build trust in order to accomplish our goals: Americans who don't feel a natural kinship with the traditional environmental movement. We need to accept that other people's priorities -- economic or cultural -- are valid and important.Many of the people I know who work to protect our air, land and water do take this more constructive attitude. My colleagues who are trying to keep our oceans sustainable care as much about the fisherman as the fish. The activists working to reduce toxins in products on our supermarket shelves are trying to make life safer for regular families like their own. But sometimes it is hard to build alliances because potential partners assume environmentalists will be inflexible -- and see their work as more important than anyone else's. We need to fix that perception.A good place to start would be showing that we can take a joke. That's a small thing, but it's amazing how taking yourself less seriously can open up conversations.*We'll certainly advocate for EPA rules to promote more efficient cars, but the environmentalists I know aren't going to start lecturing you in the supermarket parking lot.This post originally appeared on EDF Voices."}, {"title": "Seventy Years Is Enough: It's Time to Put the Draize Test Out of Its Misery", "text": "2014 marks a morbid 70th anniversary. It was in 1944 that U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologist Dr. John Henry Draize invented the now-infamous \"Draize test\" to evaluate the safety of cosmetics and other personal care products using live animals.In the eye version of the test, rabbits are placed in restraining stocks so that they cannot struggle or wipe their eyes. Their eyelids are pulled apart, and the substance is dripped, sprayed or rubbed onto the eye. The eyelids are then held together for a moment to ensure that the substance is all over the eye. The rabbits are then observed in order to determine whether or not irritation occurs over the next three days. They are usually monitored for a further three weeks before being either killed or, if there is no permanent damage to the eye, reused after a \"wash-out\" period that removes traces of the previously tested product. It's hard to say which fate is better.In the similarly horrific skin test, test substances are typically rubbed onto the shaved backs of rabbits to check for the severity of the reaction over a period of two weeks, before they are killed or \"washed out\" and reused.It's worth noting that if someone were to do such things to an animal outside a laboratory, it would be considered cruelty to animals -- a felony offense in many states. But these tests are still perfectly legal the United States when conducted by testing facilities in order to bring a new eye shadow or cologne to market.When the tests were first concocted by Draize in 1944, product testing was in its infancy. One would think that if these draconian tests are still legal to use today, then they must be the only tests available, or that they must be extremely accurate.But they are neither.The FDA's own investigators have concluded that that the Draize test is \"plagued\" by a lack of reproducibility, and that there lacks a clear relationship between rabbit and human eye responses. Furthermore, studies comparing hundreds of instances of accidental human eye exposure to assorted household products with Draize rabbit eye test data for the same products have found little or no predictive value for the rabbit test.Likely reasons for the lack of correlation is that the structures of human and rabbit eyes are quite different. For example, the cornea accounts for 25 percent of the surface area of a rabbit's eye, in contrast to 7 percent of the human eye. The human cornea is also thicker.The Draize skin test doesn't fare much better. This is because the anatomy and cellular makeup of skin varies among different species; therefore, responses to products vary between the species. Indeed, the rabbit is now considered a notoriously poor predictor of human irritation potential.In short, humans are not rabbits.Science advances rapidly, and, as one would expect, since 1944 there have been many improvements in determining product safety. The information that has historically been gained from animal tests has increasingly been replaced with quicker, cheaper and more reliable non-animal methods.Research to replace the Draize tests started in the 1980s, and in 2009 two alternative methods for assessing eye irritation were accepted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the international body responsible for producing and validating international test guidelines. Replacements for the skin irritation test using small discs of human skin cells grown in laboratories have also been accepted and validated by the OECD. When developing a new product, companies can use these validated and scientifically proven alternatives in lieu of the now-antiquated Draize tests. In addition, manufacturers can use established ingredients for which safety data is already available.Hundreds of \"Leaping Bunny\"-certified cruelty-free companies have proven that it is possible to make safe and quality cosmetic products without testing on animals. Moreover, governments around the world are increasingly prohibiting the use of animals for cosmetics testing. In March 2013 the European Union not only completely banned animal testing for cosmetics but also banned the sale of any new cosmetics tested on animals anywhere in the world. Other countries are also modernizing. India and Israel have banned all animal testing for cosmetics and Korea, and ASEAN are also moving toward a ban.It's high time that the United States -- the country that birthed the infamous Draize tests -- catch up with the rest of the world and put the misery out of these tests once and for all.Seventy years is enough!"}, {"title": "'Slingshot Spider' Launches Itself At Prey With Impressive Web (VIDEO)", "text": "You know the fear that accompanies unexpectedly walking into a spider web? How much more frightening would it be if the web were actually getting launched at you instead?Well, that's the tactic employed by a group of spiders of the Theridiosomatidae family.The arachnids were recently documented weaving webs in the Peruvian Amazon and using their creations as \"slingshots.\" The spiders sit in the middle of the webs as they launch themselves -- and their webs -- forward.Should a spider miss its target, it can retract an anchor line spun from the middle of the web to a solid surface nearby. The line draws the entire \"slingshot\" apparatus taught, preparing it to be launched at prey once more.Jeff Cremer, one of the brains behind Peru Nature, a rainforest expedition company, recorded the astounding phenomenon and uploaded the video to YouTube earlier this month.Despite having been filmed at 60 frames per second, the spider in the clip above launches its web fast enough to be almost imperceptible. In an email to The Huffington Post, Cremer acknowledged the shot was no easy feat.\"We were in the middle of the Amazon jungle, in the middle of the night and standing in about 50 cm. of water with mosquitos flying,\" he wrote, adding they used only a flashlight to illuminate the spider.Although this unique behavior has been documented as far back as 1932, Wired reports the spiders have \"remained basically unknown\" to all but a small cadre of experts.Fortunately, the spiders are less than 1 cm in size and pose no threat to humans.

A Cautionary Tale", "text": "It took a few days after a state of emergency was declared across nine West Virginia counties and one-sixth of the state's population was told not to drink or bathe using their tap water for the national news media to discover a story of national importance occurring in the political backwaters of Appalachia.But most haven't yet picked up on what may be the most interesting and important detail: why so many people in this water-rich state depend on a single, privately-owned treatment system and distribution network that sprawls across nine counties for their supply of drinking water.In many communities, the tale of coal industry activities polluting people's drinking water supply is anything but new. Places like Prenter in Boone County have seen a lot worse.The topic of waste from coal preparation plants polluting well water in Prenter was the centerpiece of a blockbuster piece published by The New York Times in 2009 that described the systemic failures of states like West Virginia to enforce the federal Clean Water Act. Here's the lead from that story:\"Jennifer Hall-Massey knows not to drink the tap water in her home near Charleston, W.Va.Reporter Charles Duhigg goes on to say that residents and scientists believe the pollution got into their water from injections of coal slurry -- the waste byproduct of washing coal -- into abandoned mine shafts, where it could flow through cracks in the earth into groundwater and, ultimately, the wells of local residents. According to the Times, coal companies had injected nearly two billion gallons of coal slurry into the ground within an eight-mile radius of Prenter between 2004 and 2009. For context, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster spilled only one-tenth that much oil into the Gulf of Mexico.The article also describes the roots of the latest crisis in West Virginia in appalling detail: how even well-intentioned and ambitious state regulators proved no match for the politically sophisticated and powerful coal industry, how local politicians punish regulators who do their job effectively, and how the coal industry has perfected the art of dodging accountability for the damage it causes. But picking up where the Times left off, the story of how Prenter finally got drinking water restored provides even more useful insight into the roots of last week's water crisis.In late 2009, the state gave final approval [PDF] for a public-private partnership between Boone County and West Virginia American Water Company -- the utility that owns the treatment facility and water distribution network shut down since last Thursday -- for a multi-million dollar project to run water lines out to Prenter and nearby communities. The project was mostly paid for by a federal Housing and Urban Development grant, with Boone County and West Virginia American Water Company making up the difference. Not a penny was paid by the coal companies that polluted the water in the first place.The paper trail of the state's Public Service Commission filings that document the dramatic expansion of WVAWC's water network over the past two decades (see map below) reveals similar stories happening again and again, as the company gobbled up one municipal utility after another, as well as individual homes whose wells were polluted by coal mining activities.In one example, in 2004 the state gave approval for WVAWC to develop the Sharples Water Line Extension project in Logan County, which, according to PSC documents [PDF], was necessary because a coal company's mining plans were likely to destroy wells that had provided a reliable supply of clean drinking water to nearby residents for generations. According to the documents:\"Arch Coal's proposed Mountain Laurel Mine will use longwall mining techniques. This will potentially de-water the aquifer that is the source for the Logan County [Public Service Department's] Sharples system. Private wells in the community of Mifflin could potentially be compromised by longwall mining practices from the Mountain Laurel Mine.\"The cost of the project, which was ultimately approved, was shared between Arch Coal, WVAWC and a Community Development Block Grant. While the documents sought to justify the expense on the grounds that the extension would \"eliminate the use of local groundwater and provide a more than adequate supply of drinking water that will sustain the expected growth in the project area,\" nobody seriously believed there would be any \"expected growth\" near a massive mining complex in Logan County, where the population has been declining for decades.The real motivation for the project is found further down in the engineering report, which details the expected economic development benefits: \"The extension Project will help satisfy mine permitting requirements for Arch Coal's proposed Mountain Laurel mine.\"Similar evidence of how public money has been used to directly benefit the coal industry -- while simultaneously expanding the customer base of a private, multinational water company -- runs throughout West Virginia PSC documents. In many cases, public funds were not used quite so directly to subsidize coal companies, but rather to restore water service to homes where wells or community water systems dried up or were destroyed by coal industry activities (see here [PDF] and here [PDF]).Unsurprising to anyone familiar with West Virginia politics, Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was quick to absolve the coal industry of culpability for the current disaster, blaming it on the chemical industry -- and a particularly bad actor at that. But any attempt to decouple the coal industry from this disaster fails the laugh test, given that the spilled chemical was not only used by mining companies to wash coal, but that it had already been oozing into West Virginians' water supply long before last Thursday through underground injections of coal slurry near communities such as Prenter. What's more, as the Times and other observers make clear, the lackadaisical attitude of state regulators toward inspections is itself a result of the coal industry's longstanding and overwhelming influence over state government at all levels.But would a better system of permitting and inspecting chemical facilities have prevented this disaster from occurring? Would it prevent a different type of accident, say if an out-of-control barge or tractor-trailer runs into a chemical storage tank? What about intentional sabotage or, God forbid, a terrorist attack?The fact that 16 percent of the state's population depends on WVAWC's Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Facility for drinking water is a central factor in the scale of the disaster and, as the PSC paper trail demonstrates, the coal industry has a lot of culpability in that situation as well. But still other factors have led to the expansion and consolidation of WVAWC's service territory, which is why the moral of this story applies beyond coal country.The West Virginia chemical spill is a cautionary tale for communities all over the country where multinational companies are coming in and buying up municipal water utilities to manage people's drinking water supply for profit. And factors beyond groundwater pollution by the coal industry are driving those trends, such as systemic under-investment in public water systems by federal, state and local governments, and the rapaciousness with which private companies, aided by political favoritism and lobbying, are pursuing expansion of their influence, customer base and profit margins.There is much more that can be said about the risks and drivers of water privatization, and people should read the many excellent reports published by Food and Water Watch on the subject.But there are also immediate things people can do to help West Virginians and people across Appalachia reduce the risk of this type of accident from happening again. There is currently an effort afoot by West Virginians to protect their homes and water supply by taking away the authority of the demonstrably ineffective West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to oversee coal mine permitting in the state and instead turning the program over to federal authorities. You can support that effort here.There is also a coalition of groups across Appalachia working to ensure the Obama administration fulfills its much-delayed promise to replace a Bush-era rule that weakened regulations on mining near streams.

Why? Because they believed their feline companions carried the spirit of deities.Well, I feel the same about my three dogs, Rory, Paris, and Tia. To me they represent unconditional love and companionship. A constant companion, a dog bears witness to your life and history without judgement. So when our middle dog, 13-year-old dog Tia passed away suddenly, last week of an apparent stroke due to a blood clot, it caught us by surprise.Tia arrived at our doorstep six years ago, when her family moved into the house next door. At first she came to simply browse through our garbage can or to search out carelessly abandoned spiral notebooks, or mail that arrived in editable envelopes. Once she even got the munchies for two 20s and a 10 dollar bill snagged from my wallet.Said differently, Tia preferred to hang out with our two wild boy dogs and live a western lifestyle. She was happiest chasing anything that strolled, crawled or slithered across \"their territory,\" than live the more domesticated life of a typical housedog.While she was also happy to tree the occasional cat that dared venture up the dirt road to our home, she got more than she bargained for when she sent one over sized \"kitty\"up a tree. It turned out to be a mountain lion.With uncommon courage I ignored making direct eye contact with the lion, and I ignored its warning hiss as I slowly bent down into a crouching position close to the ground and grabbed my own dog Rory by the tail. When he sharply swung his head around to look my way, I grabbed his collar and pulled him to safety. Feeling abandoned, Tia reluctantly followed.Over the years, she bravely treed various bear, raccoons, and numerous harmless squirrels. Her last fearless act, however, was a heroic one. Even the police agreed.A few months ago, when a would-be robber entered our unlocked kitchen door in the middle of the night, he made an abrupt U-turn. Just in front of him, sleeping with \"one eye open,\" lay Tia-the-Terrorist. Armed with sharp teeth and a bellowing bark, she chased him down our long dirt driveway barking at him continuously until he disappeared around the corner, out of sight.In family circles, she was known by two names. Found abandoned at 6-weeks-old along the side of a road in New Mexico in a box with her tiny litter-mates, TIA led a dog's life fully and with gusto.Now, Mother Nature has stepped in to remind us that in the end, even a dog must have its day. All things that live, must someday die.In the end, Tia-the-Terrorist will also be remembered by her second name: \"Tia Mi Amour.\" She will live with love in our hearts and memory forever.Alexia Parks, a science journalist and impact entrepreneur, has an uncommon love for the well-lived life, lived off leash."}, {"title": "2013 a Year for Green Accomplishments: Looking Ahead as New Mayors Take the Helm", "text": "At the end of every calendar year, publications are filled with surveys of the past year's news and accomplishments, trends and surprises. And along with the reviews, there are often predictions of events or trends which might happen in the next 12 months.So in that spirit, I want to review some of last year's events, particularly related to urban green issues, preview the administrations of new mayors in some of the nation's largest cities, and make my predictions for 2014. And I want to hear your ideas.For the most used, perhaps overused, word in the green world last year, \"sustainable\" is a narrow winner over \"resilient\" and its close relative \"resilience.\" These words left the world of the environment and urban design for the more general vocabulary and were used so often they have become devalued. Type the word \"sustainable\" in the Google search box and you come up with more than 62 million entries, primary among them a news report about McDonald's pursuit of \"sustainable beef.\" If the source of the beef loses its life, is that sustainable?\"Resilience\" gets a mere 9.3 million results, and one of the most highly-ranked is a link to www.resilience.org, a pretty terrific website that also contains a solid, brief definition of the word.Looking back, several 'green' mayors of large cities left office left office after long and distinguished tenures which included significant accomplishments in making their cities more livable, especially though the revitalization of defunct waterfronts and the transformation of brownfields into spectacular new parks.The honor list includes New York and Michael Bloomberg, whose expansion and improvement  of the city's park system was the most remarkable since the great public works of the Franklin Roosevelt years, and whose administration made solid progress across the board in their ambitious \"PlaNYC 2030\" sustainable development agenda (including adding 800,000 new trees). Ditto for Thomas Menino, who made Boston a cleaner, greener and, economically vibrant city. Across the country, Antonio Villaraigosa left the Los Angeles mayor's office, leaving behind new efforts to revive the Los Angeles River, a nascent bike share system, and a big new green space, Grand Park (see page 90) in the center of the city.Far Rockaway Park, New York City, part of PlaNYC regional parks initiative. Image by Albert Vecerka/ESTO (original here)Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak also left office, only months after his city was honored as having the nation's best city park system, according to The Trust for Public Land's ParkScore index. Minneapolis was also selected as the nation's fittest city, with several major park projects about to get started. In New Jersey, Newark Mayor Cory Booker was elected to the U.S. Senate, leaving behind a suite of new parks and playgrounds, including the new Newark Riverfront Park, built in partnership with the Trust for Public Land and Essex County.Also moving toward a conclusion to his tenure is Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, who has presided over one of the nation's most ambitious plans to make a city \"green.\" It includes a major commitment to utilize green infrastructure to clean the city's storm water runoff, by using existing parks and new green spaces to capture and clean storm water -- allowing it to infiltrate the ground rather than run into the sewer system, which can cause it to overflow.So who will be the next \"Green Mayor\" of a major US city? There are several compelling candidates, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. In 2012, he unveiled \"Sustainable Chicago 2015\" to make the city greener and more environmentally sustainable, with new parks and cleaner air and water. Last summer Emanuel broke ground for a major project to turn an abandoned elevated freight rail line into a linear park and greenway called \"The 606\", and Chicago's bike share system is now one of the largest in the nation.Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel leads groundbreaking for the 606 greenway project.In San Francisco, Mayor Edwin Lee, and his and his creative parks general manager Phil Ginsburg are busy building parks and converting waterfront brownfields into major new developments with significant parks and open space amenities. Further south, in Los Angeles, new mayor Eric Garcetti has already announced ambitious goals with \"some very specific metrics -- 20,000 green jobs and a program to do that by cleaning the water, by installing solar power, and by making buildings more energy efficient.\" Garcetti has also been named to President Obama's Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, along with 15 other mayors and eight governors.Both Garcetti and Bill de Blasio, the new mayor of New York, need to appoint parks directors. De Blasio has yet to spell out his \"green agenda,\" though he has pledged to banish horse-drawn carriages from Central Park, and during his campaign he endorsed an idea to take away and redistribute 20 percent of the charitable income from the more successful non-profit park conservancies.Other new mayors to watch are Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who reappointed environment and energy chief Kevin Swett and environment commissioner Nancy Girard. New Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, like de Blasio, has pledged to focus on trying to eliminate income inequality, particularly between white and black residents. In her inaugural speech, she called for continued development of mass transit and \"green, walkable neighborhoods.\"Aside from city halls, there are other urban green trends to keep an eye on. If 2013 was the \"year of the bike share,\" will 2014 see continued growth in both the number of bikes and riders? Or will the novelty wear off and costs go up?Green infrastructure will likely continue to be a major trend, as the 770+ cities with combined sewer systems (10 percent of which must comply with consent decrees by the Environmental Protection Agency to clean their water) find new ways to channel and mitigate storm water runoff, often by using renovated or new parks and green spaces. Finally, 2014 may be the \"year of the urban greenway,\" as Chicago opens the first phase of The 606, and New Orleans, the greater Seattle area, Los Angeles and New York all explore plans to convert abandoned rail lines into linear parks and trails.Let's hear from the readers about green urban accomplishments of last year, mayors I may not have mentioned, and trends that you see developing for green cities this year."}, {"title": "Public Water Systems Can Help the War on Poverty", "text": "No army can win a war without good quality water. Dysentery took more lives in the U.S. Civil War than battle wounds. Likewise, the War on Poverty won't be won without healthy and affordable water.The conversation this week about the War on Poverty is long overdue, especially welcome is the noisy clamor to raise the minimum wage. At the same time, families' budgets swell with multiple expenses. The War on Poverty will be won when some of those can be shrunk, especially those that can be more equitably shared. Let's take a look at water.An account might start with the nearly $500 average that a U.S. households spends on water. On top of that, figure in their share of the $14 billion that U.S. households spend on bottled water -- to some degree motivated by a lack of trust in public water. Then there are important savings to take stock of: reduced health care costs due to good quality water. Those savings can be significant.So upon first glance, the news released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors spelling out increased municipal spending for water and sanitation seems highly favorable.\"The historical spending record clearly establishes local government as the dominant investor in public water, and by virtue of the investment, also establishes local government as a critical water environment steward. Combined public water and wastewater investment is estimated to be $1.77 trillion from 1972 to 2010: $981.4 billion for water supply; and, $796.4 billion for wastewater systems.\"The mayors' study begins in 1972, when not long after the War on Poverty began, the Clean Water Act was passed during the Nixon administration. It triggered massive public spending in public water.While government investment in the water commons is terrific news, according to the U.S. Mayors report, \"A serious concern for local government is the disproportionate financial impact on families at or below the poverty level ... because user fees command a greater percentage of their annual incomes. This disparate financial impact is regressive.\"Not only is it regressive, but the investment is inadequate. The Conference of Mayors estimates that, \"investment needs over the 20 year horizon (2008-2028) is likely in the range of $2.8 to $4.8 trillion.\" Many municipalities have already issued all the bonds they can without ruining their credit ratings. Local taxes and water rates have been rising to pay the costs.The mayors support \"the widely held view by Americans that water is a common good owned by everyone, and government should retain the authority to deliver it locally/regionally.\" Yet they raise concerns that water is becoming unaffordable, hampered by current rate structures, which can restrict differential pricing for varied users. They call for \"a fresh look at local affordability and national water policy.\"How can we improve the state of our water commons and guarantee the right to water and sanitation without driving families deeper into poverty? A Forbes article raises the possibility of a clean water trust fund as a solution for how to raise the money more equitably.\"In a 2009 study, the U.S. Government Accountability Office considered how to raise $10 billion annually for the fund and suggested that payment come from industries that profit from water or damage its quality, including those that make beverages, fertilizers and pesticides, flushable products, pharmaceuticals, water appliances and plumbing fixtures.\"Such creative cross-subsidies offer an alternative to socking low-income users with \"full cost recovery\" -- covering all water operator costs with spiraling user charges. Behind such progressive financing is an affirmation that water is a public good, not dissimilar from public education. We all benefit from an educated population and so spread the expense across society. Likewise with water, the public health benefits are enormous. A clean water trust has the benefit of providing disincentives to polluters and is supported by consumer advocacy groups like Food and Water Watch.At the same time, there are large savings in the water sector through innovation with green or natural infrastructure -- permeable surfaces instead of channeling all storm water into waste water treatment, water recycling, using one grade of water for showers and another for drinking and more. Upstream watershed management -- especially with water utilities at the helm -- also delivers savings, as New York City has proven in its partnership with upstate farmers. These are not simple transition for utilities to make, but there is a new hopeful current emerging.Worldwide, the links between poverty reduction, public health and access to clean and affordable water are even more dramatic. For the billions of people without clean water and sanitation, climbing out of poverty while carrying a child sick with diarrhea is impossibly unfair.Fifty years ago, it wasn't uncommon for water hoses to be used against anti-poverty and civil rights campaigners. Following in their footsteps, and taking a cue from Isaiah, we might try bending those hoses into clean, affordable water for all.--Daniel Moss is Coordinator of Our Water Commons and active in the Reclaiming Public Water Network.

The sound, unique to individual dolphins, is used to announce their presence to others or communicate with their young.\"We all noticed it right away; Bella was alone in the pool, floating peacefully, making her baby whistle, and it caught our attention because we all know each and every sound every one of the dolphins make,\" head dolphin trainer Dianne Cameron said.Bella continued using her baby whistle on her calf after delivery, confirming the likelihood that she was communicating with her calf in utero -- something the Six Flags staff members say they\u2019ve never encountered before.Holley Muraco, the park\u2019s marine mammal reproductive physiologist in charge of all births, told The Huffington Post that Bella\u2019s friendly nature provided a new glimpse into pregnant dolphin behavior.\u201cBella was doing it at the surface of the water,\u201d she said, noting how comfortable she is with humans. \u201cPotentially this is taking place more often than we\u2019re aware of, more often under water.\u201dMuraco said that in the future, they will use hydrophones in the tanks to record other late-term pregnant dolphins.Bella\u2019s pre-delivery baby whistle caught the attention of researchers at the Marine Mammal Behavior and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Southern Mississippi, one of the top dolphin research centers in the U.S. The lab immediately put together a plan to observe and record all data on Bella.Muraco believes the pre-birth baby whistle may be an important way for mothers to teach their calves how to recognize them in a group as soon as they\u2019re born -- furthering the case for keeping oceans quiet and unaffected by noise from shipping and fishing.\u201cWe are going to have to accept that animals are trying to survive in everything we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Muraco said, noting that the species often live as \u201curban dolphins\u201d residing in marinas. \u201cHumans have to live their lives, but maybe we can be a little more mindful of certain areas as were researching. We\u2019re learning more and more that there are predictable places these animals are frequenting, which places they go during the pregnancy.\u201dShe hopes research sparked by Bella\u2019s baby whistle may lead to ocean quieting in important areas for pregnant dolphins -- something that can be achieved by slowing boats in high-traffic areas."}, {"title": "Well This Is Rather Alarming: Nearly 6,000 Gas Leaks Discovered In Washington, D.C.", "text": "You've never wanted a city-wide smoking ban more than this.An alarming new report put out in the journal Environmental Science & Technology finds nearly 6,000 natural gas leaks around Washington, D.C.

Earlier this week, more than 300,000 West Virginians were without access to clean water after a chemical used to wash coal spilled into a nearby river. This is a chemical we know little about, and it's shining a bright light on the need to reform our nation's outdated toxic chemical laws.This obscure chemical, 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, or MCHM, was causing real health problems as the spill unfolded. Hundreds of residents reported health concerns such as nausea, and at least 10 people have been hospitalized. And it became clear just how little we know about the health risks this chemical poses -- there's not even a single publicly available health study on it.West Virginia has a poor track record of enforcing the Clean Water Act, and federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Freedom Industries, the company responsible for the spill, violated the landmark water pollution law. This is on top of the fact that neither federal nor state officials have inspected this chemical storage facility since 1991. As respondents continue the clean up, the short-term and long-term ecological impacts this chemical spill may have on the surrounding area remain unknown.There are a lot of questions surrounding this spill, but one thing is clear: our chemical regulatory system is broken. Our nation's primary chemical law -- the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)  -- was passed in 1976. Over the years, it's become outdated and is now so flawed that many chemicals, including the one involved in this spill, go virtually unregulated.Many of these chemicals could pose a major risk to public health. There's a growing body of research linking some toxic chemicals to alarming health problems, including childhood cancers, infertility, and learning disabilities.It's time our laws catch up to the science. While there have been some recent efforts in Congress to update the Toxic Substances Control Act, this issue has taken on new urgency following the chemical spill in West Virginia.Given what the American people are seeing play out on their TV screens, you may think it would be difficult for anyone in Congress not to act. But corporate polluters and their allies in Washington have fought tooth and nail over the years to prevent any additional federal oversight and environmental safeguards. There's no reason to think they'd stop now.Times have changed a lot since President Ford was in office, but our nation's primary toxic chemicals law has not. Republicans and Democrats in Washington should redouble their efforts to finally reform the Toxic Substances Control Act in a way that truly protects public health.

Almost a week later, thousands are still without drinking water, and many of those who've been given the \"all clear\" have been hospitalized shortly after drinking or bathing in water they were told is clean. And yet this disaster is just a single, impossible-to-ignore, example of the constant toll that fossil fuels exact upon us every day.If you're like me, each new disaster leaves you angry and frustrated. That's normal. But here's the one thing we can't afford to forget:It doesn't have to be this way.Humanity has been given a wonderful gift: We know how to get all of the energy we need without using dirty or dangerous fuel sources. It's no longer a question of whether we can -- but of whether we will.The amount of accessible energy from the sun and wind is far greater than what the entire world is projected to need in coming decades. The key word there is accessible. We already know how to reap that energy bounty -- worldwide -- with technology that already exists (and will only get even better).This isn't speculation. Scientists and engineers have crunched the numbers and shown that it's doable: a 100 percent clean-energy economy.Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi, professors at Stanford and U.C. Davis, respectively, published an article in Scientific American five years ago that showed how the world could be powered by clean energy within decades. Last year, they published an even more detailed plan, in Energy Journal, for how the state of New York could switch to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. They've since produced draft plans for California and Washington, as well.Read these plans, and you'll know right away that they aren't fanciful. Resources, technology, and economics are all taken into account: We can do this. Exactly how hard -- or easy -- will it be? My hunch is that it will be challenging but perhaps easier than most people think -- but the important point is that this should be our goal. If we know we can achieve 100 percent clean energy, why would we settle for less? Even if we set aside their many drawbacks, is there a single good reason to rely on coal, oil, or natural gas if we don't have to?Every week, I read about new clean energy successes, whether it's yet another utility deciding to add more renewable generation (because it's the cheapest option), an innovative plan for financing community solar, or the news that the new Popemobile is an electric bicycle. Yesterday it was the news that both Spain and Denmark got more power from wind than any other source last year. I can't get enough of these stories. But I also know that each of them is only one more step toward the ultimate goal: 100 percent clean energy.That's why every time I hear President Obama or someone in his administration talk about an \"all of the above\" energy policy, it's like fingernails on a solar panel. If someone asked you which way leads to the top of a mountain, would you tell them \"all of the above\"? Of course not. The route to the summit might not be direct or easy. But if you ever want to get there, you need to know which way is up and which way is down.We all know the adage about the forest and the trees. People in general aren't always good at seeing the big picture or taking the long view. Politicians are usually worse than most. Leaders, though -- true leaders -- have the ability to show us the mountaintop and inspire us upward.That's the kind of leadership we need to see from President Obama, and he can start by making it official that 100 percent clean energy is our goal."}, {"title": "The Image of Urban Vitality: Is It Really Just Skyscrapers?", "text": "By Mike Powe and Jeana Wiser, Preservation Green LabView of Manhattan from Brooklyn.When you picture the heart of a thriving city, what image comes to mind? You might picture a New York avenue, lined with spectacular, towering skyscrapers. The image of a successful city seems inextricably tied to images of buildings stretching into the air.It turns out, however, that the skyscraper may not deserve such a tight link to our idea of urban vitality. A better image? Look to the neighborhoods just beyond the shadows of downtown's corporate and condo towers, in the modest (yet bustling!) blocks of older, smaller buildings.Millennium Park in Chicago, with the Willis and Legacy Towers beyond.Just as skyscrapers have their advocates, they also have their critics. Just last week, Treehugger's Lloyd Alter presented a strong counterargument against growing cities into the clouds, suggesting that new towers often serve as inefficient, expensive homes that often succumb to issues of vacancy.Richard Florida has also suggested that skyscrapers often mute the \"spontaneous encounters that provide cities with so much of their social, intellectual, and commercial energy.\" Meanwhile, Tim Halbur, communications director for the Congress for the New Urbanism, points out that while skyscrapers may boost a city's supply of rentable space, they also pull life away from the street.H Street in Washington, D.C.Human-scaled neighborhoods reward walkers with interesting window displays and a variety of small businesses to consider (see the work of Jan Gehl for more information). A tower downtown may offer high-density housing, but on the flip side, small-scale blocks have diverse spaces that see incredible intensity of use throughout the workday and into weeknights and weekends.The Alps Hotel in Seattle, Wash. This building has more units of housing and more storefronts than the majority of block-sized bread-loaf projects in the city.This spring, the National Trust's Preservation Green Lab will release a report that builds upon extensive city mapping and analysis to demonstrate the important role that older, smaller buildings and mixed-vintage commercial corridors play in fostering vibrant communities. We will show, with data, just how right Jane Jacobs was: Older, smaller buildings and diverse urban fabric play a critical role in supporting robust local economies, distinctive local businesses, and unforgettable places where people connect and unwind.So, the next time you conjure up an image of a vibrant urban place, make sure you don't overlook cities' older, character-rich neighborhoods!"}, {"title": "Real Conservatives Don't Burn Coal", "text": "I am a political conservative and an environmentalist -- a position, it seems, that is increasingly irreconcilable. Australia's conservative-minded Coalition government is busy dismantling a carbon tax. Canada's Conservative government has withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol. And in the U.S., the tea party is purging Republicans who agree with the 97 percent of climate scientists who say human activity is causing global warming.As a politician and the former president of the Maldives -- one of the world's most climate-vulnerable nations -- this places me in a quandary. A believer in free markets, small government and globalization, I feel a natural kinship with the school of thought that brought us Thatcherism and Reaganomics. But the Maldives lies just 1.5 meters above the rising seas. To deny the dangers of climate change is to ignore my country's greatest national security threat.I suspect I am not alone in this predicament. As climate change bites, more and more world leaders are forced to grapple with its consequences: fiercer droughts, wildfires, storms and floods. A denialist conservative movement has no solutions to offer these countries and therefore risks irrelevancy.It also leaves conservatives on the wrong side of history. During the past few weeks, as the world commemorated Nelson Mandela, an uncomfortable spotlight has been shone on conservatives who branded the African National Congress a terrorist body in the 1980s. How will today's conservative climate refuseniks explain themselves to future generations in a world made hotter, nasty and poor by global warming?Strong action today to curb emissions should prevent catastrophic climate change. But if we ignore the issue for another decade, we face a world of soaring temperatures, ferocious storms and a climate out of control. Future generations will hold conservatives responsible for wrecking the planet.My party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), owes much to the conservative movement. It has provided us with ideological inspiration and practical know-how. Britain's Conservative Party taught the MDP how to campaign, providing invaluable support in a young democracy. We are also grateful to conservative-run governments such as Canada's, which pressured the Maldives to hold last year's elections when the country looked as if it might slip back into dictatorship.The actions of politicians such as David Cameron, William Hague and John Baird in support of democracy in a far-off land demonstrate the very best in enlightened leadership. When our movement is capable of exemplary governance, why do so many conservatives let us down on climate change?It was not always this way. Teddy Roosevelt expanded the U.S. national park system. Richard Nixon introduced the Clean Air Act and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol to limit CFCs. And George H. W. Bush introduced a cap-and-trade system to curb acid rain.But contemporary politicians fail to uphold one of the founding principles of conservatism: the duty to conserve. There is nothing conservative about advocating the destruction of the climate and thus all we hold dear. This is not a credible conservative standpoint; it is reckless and extreme.The conservative movement's pro-fossil fuel advocacy also flies in the face of the free-market economics we espouse. The oil, gas and coal industries have benefited from a century of subsidies and tax breaks. So why are we continuing to subsidize highly profitable and polluting fossil fuel firms while choking off support for clean energy? We are not supposed to be the fossil fuel industry's trade union.Capitalism, free trade and globalization have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and helped countries such as the Maldives graduate from developing to middle-income status. We owe a lot to neoclassical economics. But as any economist will tell you, sometimes markets fail. The modern economy allows companies to dump dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at no cost. The responsible, conservative approach to this problem is to price and/or regulate these emissions.Fortunately, this position is starting to find acceptance even in the unlikeliest quarters. ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell are already planning their future growth on the expectation that governments will impose a price on carbon emissions. If oil companies can accept the inevitability of climate action, why can't conservative politicians?Enough of this antediluvian denialism; it is time for climate-conscious conservatives to speak out. We should ask ourselves what Winston Churchill, Thatcher or Reagan would do.Even in the face of vested interests or powerful opponents, they would not shirk their responsibilities.

But that's still a lot of people. More than 25 million, in fact. And, as you may have guessed, the typical resolutions are personal. The top five for 2014 include losing weight, saving money, and staying fit and healthy.But there's a way to accomplish all those things and protect the planet, too. Eat less beef. That's right. If we all ate less beef, we would not only lose weight, save money and improve our health, we also would significantly cut the pollution that causes global warming.Resolution: Lose WeightLosing weight was the No. 1 resolution in 2014. Given that 69 percent of Americans over 19 are either overweight or obese, that shouldn't be a shocker. What may come as a surprise, though, is that red meat -- beef, pork and lamb -- may be a key culprit making us fat.A June 2005 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, for example, followed some 55,000 healthy, middle-aged Swedish women. The researchers found that vegans, vegetarians who ate dairy products, and study participants who ate poultry but avoided red meat had a lower risk of being overweight or obese than their more carnivorous counterparts. \"The take-home message,\" lead study author P.K. Newby, a scientist at Tufts University, told the Washington Post, \"is that individuals who have the lowest risk of being overweight or obese are consuming a mostly plant-based diet.\"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published an even bigger study in June 2010 involving roughly 100,000 men and 270,000 women between the ages of 25 and 70 in 10 European countries. The study, which analyzed the connection between weight gain and total meat, red meat, poultry and processed meat consumption, found that a subject increasing his or her meat intake by 9 ounces a day -- the equivalent of one steak at 450 calories -- would lead to a weight gain of nearly 4\u00bd pounds over a five-year period.So if you want to shed some pounds, you should cut back on beef, as well as pork and lamb.Resolution: Spend Less, Save MoreEating less meat -- especially the more expensive grades of beef -- will fatten your wallet. The most recent available government data peg the average cost of a pound of ground beef at $3.88, roast beef at $4.88, and steak at $6.33. If you want to splurge, the top of the line sirloin -- USDA Choice boneless -- will set you back $6.80 a pound. Meanwhile, ham -- excluding canned and luncheon slices -- costs only $2.80 a pound, and a whole chicken, $1.52 a pound. Even boneless chicken breasts are only $3.45 a pound, still less than ground beef.Eating pasta or beans at least once a week instead of meat would stretch your dollars further. For example, if a family of four substituted a meatless spaghetti dinner ($1.29 a pound) for roast beef ($7.32 for 1\u00bd pounds), they would save around $6. That's an annual savings of $312.Resolution: Stay Fit and HealthyIf you want to stay fit, exercise regularly. If you want to stay healthy and live longer, eat less red meat, which has been linked to cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.In March 2009, a 10-year National Cancer Institute review of studies that followed half a million Americans found that those who ate 4 ounces of red meat or more daily increased their overall risk of premature death 30 percent compared with those who consumed less. Sausage, luncheon meats and other processed meats also increased the risk. Those who ate mostly poultry or fish had a lower risk of premature death.A March 2012 Harvard School of Public Health review, meanwhile, looked at studies that collectively followed 120,000 Americans' eating habits over a 28-year period. It found that people who ate a serving of beef, pork or lamb every day had a 13 percent increased risk of premature death compared with those who ate little or no red meat. Daily helpings of processed meat, such as two slices of bacon or one hot dog, increased the risk of premature death 20 percent.The Harvard review also found that replacing one serving of red meat with fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, low-fat diary or grains was associated with a 7 percent to 19 percent lower mortality risk. The researchers estimated that 9.3 percent of male deaths and 7.6 percent of female deaths could have been prevented if study participants had consumed less than half a serving of red meat per day.\"This study provides clear evidence that regular consumption of red meat, especially processed meat, contributes substantially to premature death,\" said review co-author Dr. Frank Hu in a press release issued by the Harvard School of Public Health. \"On the other hand, choosing more healthful sources of protein in place of red meat can confer significant health benefits by reducing chronic disease morbidity and mortality.\"Resolution: Shrink Your Carbon FootprintWhen it comes to global warming, not all meat is created equal. The ruminants Americans eat -- mainly cows -- pose the biggest threat to the climate, according to an article in this month's edition of the journal Nature Climate Change.As you may remember from your high school biology class, ruminants have a multi-chambered stomach. They swallow their food, regurgitate it as cud, chew it again, and then swallow it again. During that process, they silently belch and fart methane, an odorless gas that is about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its ability to trap radiant heat in the atmosphere. And although there are a number of human activity-related, or anthropogenic, sources of methane -- rice production, landfills and burning fossil fuels, for example -- domesticated ruminants are the largest source worldwide.\"Reducing the emissions from ruminants, which are mostly associated with beef production, could make a big contribution to preventing the worst impacts of global warming,\" said Doug Boucher, director of climate research and analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a co-author of the Nature Climate Change article. \"Globally, ruminants contribute 12 percent of all anthropogenic carbon emissions, and 80 percent of those emissions are from cattle.\"The alternative? Boucher and his co-authors point out that methane emissions from pigs and poultry, which have a single-chambered stomach, are negligible by comparison. \"If you want to reduce the emissions associated with the food you eat, the most important step is to reduce your consumption of beef,\" Boucher wrote in a recent blog. \"The question of what you replace it with -- pork, poultry or plants only -- is much less important.\"If you don't have the stomach to cut out meat entirely, switching to poultry or pork would still go a long way to shrink your carbon footprint. Boucher, a biologist, pointed out that although the biggest emissions reduction would obviously come from becoming a vegan, replacing beef with poultry would get you more than 90 percent of the way there, while switching to pork would achieve at least 80 percent of the methane abatement you would get from only eating plants.The good news is Americans have been eating less meat, including beef, over the last decade. Annual U.S. beef consumption dropped from its high point of 97 pounds per person in 2002 to 81 pounds in 2011, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. But that is still more than consumers in every other country besides Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, translating into 1,850 to 2,600 pounds of annual carbon emissions per person.\"The fact that Americans are now eating more chicken than beef for the first time in 100 years demonstrates that change is possible,\" said Boucher. \"We're heading in the right direction when it comes to addressing climate change, at least on the diet front, but we have a long way to go.\"Elliott Negin is the director of news and commentary at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The progressive media watchdog group Media Matters totaled the time broadcasters devoted to climate change for a new report released Thursday.The Media Matters report deemed overall coverage of climate change \"tepid,\" and noted there were many news events in 2013 that created opportunities for coverage, including carbon dioxide levels that exceeded 400 parts per million in May, President Barack Obama's major climate policy address in June, and the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment in September.Coverage peaked in 2009, the year of the Copenhagen climate summit and the release of hundreds emails stolen from climate scientists. It was much lower for the three years that followed.CBS won the gold medal for Sunday morning coverage, devoting 16 minutes of \"Face the Nation\" to climate throughout the year. NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" meanwhile, was cited as \"failing to offer a single substantial mention of climate change in all of 2013.\" Even \"Fox News Sunday\" gave the subject more air time, at four minutes.The analysis notes that \"Face the Nation\" was the first Sunday show in five years to feature scientists discussing climate change, in a May 28 segment with climatologist Heidi Cullen. More often, the report noted, the news programs will feature politicians or media figures discussing climate.Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) announced earlier this week that they are launching an effort to pressure television networks to devote more time to covering climate change, citing Media Matters' 2012 report."}, {"title": "California Has Driest Year Ever -- And It May Get Worse", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The shore of California\u2019s Lake Oroville hasn\u2019t looked this way in modern history. Cracked dry mud shatters the canyon floor, and buoys rest 10 feet up the side of a shale hill. The remains of two vehicles -- crashed long ago -- rise from the mud like shipwrecks at low tide. The lake is only 36 percent full.To the north, Lake Shasta also is only 36 percent full. Farther south in the heart of Central Valley, San Luis Reservoir is at a dismal 30 percent capacity. The story is the same at Bass Lake, Lake Tahoe and Folsom Lake, where Muslims recently held a prayer service for rain.For California, 2013 was the driest year since the state started measuring rainfall in 1849, before it was a state, according to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, or UCAR, a consortium of 75 schools. Low rainfall has shattered records in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shasta and on up to Eugene, Ore.And if rain doesn't fall soon, the worst may be yet to come.\"As impressive as the 2013 rainfall records are, those who watch California weather will be even more focused on what happens over the next several months,\" UCAR wrote this week in an analysis. \"[And] the 2013\u201314 water year is off to a rotten start.\"The Sierra snow pack, where the state gets about a third of its water, was 84 percent below average as of Jan. 10.Meteorologists say the reason behind the low precipitation is a massive zone of high pressure nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long that has been blocking storms for more than a year. Meteorologist Daniel Swain has dubbed it \"The Ridiculously Resilient Ridge.\"\"It's like the Sierra -- a mountain range just sitting off the West Coast -- only bigger,\" Bob Benjamin, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, told the San Jose Mercury News. \"This ridge is sort of a mountain in the atmosphere. In most years, it comes and goes. This year it came and didn't go.\"The consequences may be grave.\"Each day that passes without meaningful precipitation is another day when our long-term deficits grow measurably larger,\" wrote Swain.Though lawmakers have been pushing, California Gov. Jerry Brown has not yet officially declared a drought. At a press conference on Monday, Brown indicated he would soon.\"It's coming within the next few days,\" said Brown at the press conference. \"But don't think that a letter from the governor's office is going to affect the rain.\""}, {"title": "Tigers or Coal? India Makes a Choice", "text": "\"You need to choose if you want tigers or you want electricity -- you can't have both,\" said a senior member of India's coal establishment to Ashish Fernandes of Greenpeace India. The retort appears to be the Indian government's stock response to concerns that its planned expansion of coal mining is so immense that it could render extinct the tiger population of central India. Absent significant investment in renewable energy sources, the country's use of coal for electricity production is projected to double or triple by 2030 Greenpeace estimates that mining all this coal will entail the loss of 10,000 square kilometers of surviving forests, close to 40 percent of which is tiger habitat.The Royal Bengal Tiger is India's national animal, and the country spends 1.2 billion rupees (currently $20 million) each year on Project Tiger, its flagship effort to protect the magnificent predator. Despite this expenditure, however, a census counted only 1,706 tigers in 2011, partly because of poaching and trafficking of tiger body parts used in Chinese medicine, but primarily because of declining habitat. Tigers and elephants require vast, unbroken expanses of jungle across which they can roam. As India develops, its forests are becoming fragmented into precarious islands surrounded by mines, roads, towns, power plants and other accoutrements of industrial civilization. Tigers are easily located and poisoned by poachers or they run out of prey; while elephants die in train accidents or, finding their usual migration routes blocked, wander into villages and trample on fields and huts.The acceleration of coal mining is making a bad situation critical. Ninety percent of the new extraction will come from open-cast mines, which are cheaper and simpler to operate than underground mines but more destructive of forest cover and therefore of wildlife. Although none of the planned mines are in the core areas of designated tiger reserves or other protected areas, several cut into the 10-kilometer buffer zone that India's Supreme Court has mandated around each reserve. Any commercial activity in the buffer zone requires special licenses; but illegal mining, even by government-owned companies, is common. Just as worrisome, the new coal mines will cut off vital corridors connecting the reserves -- which tigers use to find mates and elephants use in their seasonal migrations. If tigers can no longer travel long distances, their gene pools will become isolated and ultimately unviable, causing extinction. As if that were not enough, these forests also serve as watersheds that feed major rivers and supply vital resources such as tubers, fruits, fish, medicinal plants, and firewood to villagers, tens of thousands of whom will be displaced. Coal-fired power plants, which the new mines will feed, also pollute the air, water, and soil, and are the world's leading driver of climate change -- all of which raises the question of why the Government of India is relying so heavily on this damaging form of energy. The Planning Commission, the country's official think-tank, projects that almost four-fifths of India's electricity will continue to come from coal even in the 2030s, by which time the country will be needing two to three times more coal-fired electricity than it can now produce. All of India's coal will be finished by then -- a fact that does not appear to worry India's decision-makers. Coal India, the government-owned company that is one of the world's two largest coal miners (a Chinese company, the Shenhua Group, is the other one) is under immense pressure to accelerate mining to supply the country's burgeoning power sector. Recently Coal India announced that it would expand its domestic production from 435 million tons in 2011 to 615 million tons in 2017. Almost all remaining forests in central India will have to be opened up -- spelling the tiger's doom.Although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has publicly reiterated the government's support for tiger conservation, Fernandes describes his office as \"the root of all evil\" when it comes to coal mining. In March 2010 the Ministry of Environment and Forests had released a list of \"no-go\" areas -- densely forested regions, rich in wildlife, where no coal mining would be permitted -- but the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) subsequently forced it to abandon the concept. \"Every time the ministry of environment shows even a little bit of spine, they get browbeaten by the PMO and basically told to clear the project,\" alleges Fernandes. (Manmohan Singh has also come under fire for giving away publicly owned coal blocks to industrial houses so that they can cheaply supply their power plants, at an estimated loss to the exchequer of $200 billion.)The initial public offering of Coal India's shares in late 2010 may have triggered the demise of the \"no-go\" concept, which right away improved the accessibility of the company's reserves. Four global banks, all of which advertise their commitment to sustainability -- Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley -- handled the sale of 10 percent of the company's shares for 150 billion rupees (now about $2.5 billion). Coal India is raising further funds for its ambitious expansion by offering another sale of 5 to 10 percent of its shares. The combined efforts of development experts, politicians, and bankers will ensure that in a couple of decades the Royal Bengal Tiger may survive only in cages."}, {"title": "Q&A with Andy Revkin: Dialogues on the Environment", "text": "In this ongoing series, I talk with thought leaders about ideas and trends in the environmental movement.Next in the series is my conversation with environmental journalist Andy Revkin. Also a performing songwriter and accompanist for Pete Seeger, Revkin recently released his first album of original songs, hailed by Relix Magazine as \"a tasty mix of roots goulash.\"Mark Tercek: What inspired an acclaimed environmental journalist to release an album?Andy Revkin: I'm a storyteller by nature and have been using every possible medium to convey stories for more than 30 years now to as many audiences as I can reach - from book readers to TV watchers, children to elders, Twitter followers to lecture audiences. For me songwriting is simply another medium and some subjects, situations or, particularly, feelings just cry out to be sung instead of typed. Music is also a great counterpoint to journalism, which can be dispiriting and contentious.I'd been writing songs and performing in acoustic bands and as an accompanist to Pete Seeger since the early 1990's, but got serious about recording after a close call with an out-of-the-blue stroke that deprived me of the use of my right hand for a few weeks. As both a writer and guitarist, that kind of midlife jolt really gets your attention!Mark Tercek: The album's title track, \"A Very Fine Line,\" is about life's close calls. Is there any metaphor here for environmental issues?Andy Revkin: One thing I've learned, both in exploring issues like conservation biology and in family life, is that success is often a result of having strategies or capacities for surviving pinch points or critical turning points. In a person's life, it can indeed be \"a very fine line between loving and leaving.\" In covering the negotiations between New York City and upstate communities over how to keep reservoirs clean, a couple of individuals, with beer as a lubricant, found ways to sustain fractious negotiations that could easily have broken down.Mark Tercek: What's your message in the track, \"Liberated Carbon\"? Why put it into song?Andy Revkin: Even though the song is about fossil fuels, I don't see it as having a message so much as compressing into three raucous minutes the human history of fuel use that the anthropologist and science essayist Loren Eiseley called our climb up the \"heat ladder.\" I was a huge fan of Eiseley in college and his 1954 essay, \"Man the Firemaker,\" stuck with me. I wrote about this aspect of my song on Dot Earth as BP's wrecked oil well soiled the Gulf.Mark Tercek: In 2009, you left your role in print journalism at The New York Times to explore \"new ways to make information matter\" at Pace University. What advice do you have for environmentalists for getting our message heard amidst today's flood of information (and misinformation)?Andy Revkin: I think environmentalists too long have relied on framing issues in two ways: \"woe is me\" and \"shame on you.\" It's all terrible and it's all someone else's fault (usually a big company). There are plenty of bad actors, mind you (I've done my share of revealing them), and environmental losses and risks can be unnerving. But there's plenty to be energized about, and it's also vital for us -- as consumers of oil and coal and metals and plastics and all the rest - to confront both our indirect role in despoliation and to acknowledge how these resources have improved lives.I actually wrote a relevant piece awhile back about the need for a new kind of message (and song) for environmental movements, moving beyond those finger-pointing messages of decades past. Here's an excerpt:I see declining utility for the framing notions of those days -- \"woe is me\" and \"shame on you\" -- whether in songs or environmental campaigns. There are still plenty of bad actors, and there is a vital role for activists and journalists calling attention to willful malfeasance. But the biggest issues require that we turn the spotlight on ourselves. Exxon pumps the oil. We use it. Madison Avenue sells consumption, as T-Bone Burnett so artfully sang, but we do the consuming.Mark Tercek: You wrote your first long article on climate change a quarter century ago. How do you evaluate the progress we've made on the issue since then?Andy Revkin: It does sometimes haunt me to re-read that piece, and the book I wrote on global warming  in 1992. Just looking at emissions rates, of course, there's little evidence of progress. But when you look more carefully, there's room for optimism. The lack of progress is mainly due to inertia in developed countries - a transportation analyst once told me it took a century to invent suburbia and will take a similar span to un-invent it - and eagerness for cheap energy as a path out of poverty in developing countries. But both willingness and capacity to transition from a wasteful fossil fuel diet to a thriftier and more sustainable one are rapidly rising, to my eye. The climate scientist Jerry Mahlman warned in 2000 that scientific progress clarifying the picture of a human-heated world was going to be \"incremental forever.\" At the same time, solutions will be incremental and diverse, what Bill McKibben calls \"silver buckshot.\" That can be frustrating, but somehow we need to have a simultaneous sense of urgency and patience, to my eye.Mark Tercek: You've given a series of talks framed around the question \"9 Billion People + 1 Planet = ?\" What have been your takeaways about the question mark in that equation?Andy Revkin: That phrase has also the focal point of my Dot Earth blog since its launch in 2007, and what's so fascinating - and both encouraging and unnerving in some ways - is that it remains an open question. Nine billion people living like vegan monks will not have the same environmental impact as the same number living large in Las Vegas. Obviously, reality midcentury will mostly be somewhere between those two visions. My most valued guide on this question has been Joel Cohen, the Rockefeller and Columbia University population scholar whose keystone book, \"How Many People Can the Earth Support?\", essentially concludes with, \"It depends.\" Overall, that's good news.Mark Tercek: You've obviously been paying very close attention to the environmental scene for a long time. Are you optimistic about humankind's ability to manage the challenges we face?Andy Revkin: My daily rhythm is to be optimistic and energetic each morning and pretty drained and cynical by the time I get ready for bed. But somehow I wake up again most mornings ready to roll once again. I've seen so many examples of people, particularly young people, pursuing technological, scientific, social or financial innovations that can make a difference that it's hard not to be upbeat.Mark Tercek: In your view, what are environmentalists doing well? What could we do better?Andy Revkin: Environmentalists come in all shapes and flavors, which is appropriate for a \"silver buckshot\" world. There's a role for everyone, from edge pushers to centrists. I've criticized some Greenpeace actions, like the destruction of a government-funded test of a genetically modified wheat variety in Australia in 2011. But I lauded Greenpeace's \"Pulping the Planet\" push on big companies wrecking rain forests in Southeast Asia. The group's work showed how, in this century, transparency can be imposed on destructive activities, creating pressure that can to more responsible behavior.Other groups and campaigners have been effective at making President Obama's decision over the Keystone pipeline a hot political issue, but I've worried that this takes attention away from the importance of blunting oil demand if the goal is to slow extraction in marginal places - whether Alberta's tar sands or the Niger Delta.Mark Tercek: Have you read any good environmental books recently?Andy Revkin: I'm always years behind on books, sadly, but here are a few that I thought stood out in the last few years. On energy, Under the Surface: Fracking, Fortunes, and the Fate of the Marcellus Shale, by Tom Wilber, is the best up-close look at the issues attending the shale gas boom. On the unsettling and wondrous ecology of the Anthropocene, I recommend Emma Marris's Rambunctious Garden: Saving Nature in a Post-Wild World. As a guide to the complexity underlying environmental stories that seem simple at first, try Hannah Nordhaus's exploration of honeybees' troubles, The Beekeeper's Lament: How One Man and Half a Billion Honey Bees Help Feed America. Finally, Carl Safina's The View from Lazy Point: A Natural Year in an Unnatural World, is a spell-binding meditation on humanity's place in nature in a complicated, consequential century.Mark Tercek: Any good music recommendations for a fellow music fan?  Andy Revkin: I really like the young talented band Dawes, which combines infectious guitar riffs and drum patterns with carefully crafted (and thankfully audible) lyrics. (Too often, words these days are lost in overproduced layers of sound.)Sarah Jarosz is an incredibly talented multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who forges superbly understated tradition-tinged compositions with her partners on cello and fiddle.I'd also be remiss not to recommend some of the amazing musicians who contributed time and talent to my album - including the songwriter Dar Williams, the fiddler Bruce Molsky and mandolinist Mike Marshall, whose collaborations with the Brazilian virtuoso Hamilton De Holanda are particularly stunning.I set up a YouTube playlist of some of my favorite songwriters.There's much more on my music in an essay I wrote for the new website Medium.com titled \"Why Singing, Not Typing.\"Andy Revkin has covered science and the environment for 30 years in newspapers, magazines, books, documentaries and his New York Times blog, Dot Earth, winning the country's top science journalism awards multiple times.

Palm trees, cocktails, white sandy beaches, and hammocks? For many people, that is exactly how they see the Pacific, as nothing more than a holiday destination, a tropical getaway and the perfect place to escape to.  But there's more to the Pacific than that.  The harsh reality is that many of the islands in the Pacific are facing the extreme effects of climate change. Our agriculture, coastal systems, ecosystems, water resources and economy, are all at risk.Places like the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Solomon Islands and Kiribati are already being adversely affected by the climate crisis and scientists have warned that if the world does not change track now and reduce its dependency on fossil fuels, the people of the Pacific face losing much, much more.  For many years, the story told about Pacific Islanders is one that portrayed us as mere victims, a far away people who cannot do anything about the causes or realities of climate change. The media has portrayed Pacific Islanders as helpless victims ready to drown with their islands or become refugees.  We are as much helpless victims of climate change, as the Pacific Islands are ONLY holiday destinations. The truth is, we are not drowning, we are fighting.The thing you have to understand about us Pacific Islanders is that we don't see ourselves as separate of our islands and oceans. My island is part of me. The ocean is part of me. Therefore if we lose our land, it is like losing a part of us.  This connectedness with our land and oceans mean at times we must rise to protect it, as if we were protecting ourselves.Changing the Narrative  While I work for an organization (350.org Pacific) -- who I really serve is a movement of thousands of Pacific Islanders -- across 22 nations and territories -- that this year will be rising to protect ourselves in the face of climate change.  Already more than 600 of us have taken a pledge, to make 2014 the year that the Pacific Islands stand up for ourselves in the face of climate change, and in the face of the fossil fuel industry. Together we will change the narrative from that of \"we are drowning victims\" to we're powerful, peaceful warriors, drawing on our cultural strength to confront the fossil fuel industry that threatens our very existence.  As we get further into 2014, we'll be turning the pledges into action, pressuring multinational corporations that operate in the Pacific Islands to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Let's just say that if they don't they will be confronted by peaceful, warrior action.  This year is the twentieth meeting of the United Nations climate talks. Yet we are still so far away from the global commitment to protect the Pacific Islands from climate change. Instead, many nations are moving in the wrong direction. Last November, countries like Japan, Canada and Australia, used the United Nations meeting as a chance to declare that they are going to do less rather than more to reduce their emissions. We can no longer wait for these countries to take action: It is time for us to rise and protect ourselves.  When we talk about rising up as warriors, do not fear violence, mayhem or savagery. We are dignified warriors, who stand by these principles:A warrior is resilient. A warrior is not aggressive or violent, but is assertive. A warrior serves to protect their community, culture, land and ocean. A warrior is always learning. A warrior responds to the needs of those around them and of the greater good. A warrior non-violently stands their ground against an adversary, against injustice and against oppression. A warrior respectfully embodies their local culture and traditions. A warrior is accountable for their actions and words. A warrior serves those who cannot fight for themselves -- future generations, animals and plants, environments.2014 will be remembered as the year we rose together to protect our Islands, and wove a story so powerful, that it will be retold for generations to come.  It will provide us with an opportunity to stand firm in our beliefs, teachings, values and principles, to demand recognition and justice for our land, ocean, culture and peoples.  Join us -- take the pledge to stand up for the Pacific Islands here.Additional photos can be seen here."}, {"title": "Your Cat Probably Thinks You're A Cat Too, Says Scientist", "text": "Your cat probably thinks that you are a cat yourself -- albeit a much larger one.That's according to British biologist John Bradshaw, who says the way furry felines greet us (with their tails up) and rub on our legs is similar to how the animals communicate affection to other cats.\"In cat society, this sequence is usually performed by a smaller cat towards a larger one -- a kitten or young cat towards its mother or an older relative, a female towards a male,\" Bradshaw, who is foundation director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol, told The Huffington Post via email this week.\"[I]t seems to be a way that smaller cats have of indicating to larger ones that they want to remain friends. When cats started becoming friendly towards us, maybe 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, they just adapted this piece of behavior to show that they like us, too,\" he continued.Author of the 2013 book Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet (which has been attracting a resurgence of interest on social media this week), Bradshaw has been studying the history and behavior of cats for decades. He argues that to live happily with our cats, we must first come to understand their behavior and their eccentricities.For instance, knowing that cats carry out this tail-up/rub ritual as a form of friendly greeting should influence the way cat owners interact with their pets, Bradshaw says.\"Research has shown that when people interact with their cats, the interactions tend to go on for longer if they're started by the cat -- many cats seem to need to go through the tail-up/rub ritual in order to feel comfortable, and may not have time to do it if it's the person who makes the first move. So the advice would be, take your time when approaching your cat, and wait for it to at least put its tail up before making actual contact,\" he told HuffPost.Bradshaw has also advised cat lovers to keep their ears peeled for purring. Purring, he says, isn't just a way that cats express contentment, but -- as he explained to NPR's Terry Gross last year -- it can also be a sort of signal for help.\"What we think cats are doing here is just trying to reassure their person \u2014 or [another] cat \u2014 who is hearing the purr that they are no threat, and ideally they'd like them to stand still and help them do something,\" Bradshaw told Gross. \"So it starts off with kittens purring to get their mother to lie still while they're suckling, and it goes on into adulthood... It's a signal to the animals, [and] the people around them to pay attention and try to help them.\"As for whether or not your cat likes you, Bradshaw says there are a handful of tell-tale signs of a cat's affection.\"Cats show they're fond of other cats in three ways,\" he told HuffPost. \"The tail-up/rub ritual; by resting in contact; and by grooming one another. So if your cat is doing any one of these, then it likes you! It doesn't have to be all three -- for example, some cats (in my experience, especially the long-haired) don't much like sitting on people's laps, but if they're reliably doing the tail-up/rub, then everything's okay.\"To find out more about John Bradshaw's book, visit the publication's website."}, {"title": "'BeetleCopter' Soars Over Serengeti And Delivers Amazing Views (VIDEO)", "text": "It took wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas a full five months to build and learn to fly his incredible \"BeetleCopter,\" but the work was well worth it.As evidenced by the fate of his previous creation, the ground-based \"BeetleCam\" that was dissected by a curious pride of lions, wildlife photography is not without risks.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Wednesday that he plans to introduce legislation that would require inspections for chemical storage tanks located along waterways, following a disastrous spill in his home state that left 300,000 without access to clean tap water.Manchin, speaking at an event sponsored by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said he will introduce his bill on Friday. \"Anything stored along waterways or along intakes for water sources, there should be inspections done,\" Manchin said. His spokesman added that details of the measure are still being worked out.\"I just think we can all do better,\" said Manchin. \"I'm not sitting here blaming. For 25 years that storage tank farm had not been inspected in any way, shape, or form. Over 25 years. I can't fix it by condemning someone for not doing it. I can fix it by making sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\"Manchin said that while the bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to establish guidelines for storage facilities, states should be responsible for implementing and enforcing standards. He was critical of federal government overreach on regulations, more broadly, but did indicate there will be a federal role in his bill. \"We're taking away so much of the liberties and freedoms so we've got to set certain guidelines that are attainable, and let states [handle implementation],\" he said.Manchin has also been trying to revive a chemical safety reform bill that he is co-sponsoring in light of the West Virginia spill. The bill, which would make changes to the country's chemical safety laws for the first time in 38 years, has been stalled out for months, in part because of disputes among Democrats over the bill. Critics say the bill is too weak and would undermine the work of states that already have stronger chemical safety rules.Manchin said Wednesday that he has spoken with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the main critics of the legislation as it is currently written, and is hopeful that disagreements on it can be resolved.\"There's a need, a definite need, for this. What we experiencing and we just experienced in West Virginia, sure, this could happen anywhere,\" said Manchin. \"I know they want to say, 'Well, it was because of the coal industry,' but really [it applies] if you're storing anything that doesn\u2019t fall within the guidelines of what's already being tested.\"Manchin also lashed out at regulations from the EPA limiting greenhouse gas emissions from new coal-fired power plants.

Only a handful of bald eagles have collided with commercial wind turbines in the history of the industry. Moreover, the Fish and Wildlife Service rule he opposes applies to many other industries and activities beyond wind.   If he truly believes his recent statement that \"climate change is the single greatest threat to both birds and people,\" Mr. Yarnold would not single out a technology that brings great net positive benefits for wildlife, and would work with regulators on practical solutions.Photo credit: Juhl EnergyThis long-awaited program will provide more eagle conservation than currently exists today, which leaves many in the wind industry and others who share our concern for saving eagles scratching our heads over his hyperbolic response.   As stated by the preamble to the rule and the Department of Justice, \"Permits may be available to companies in all types of industries,\" such as oil and gas development, electric utilities, or transportation, which take eagles in the course of otherwise lawful activities, but these industries can work with the Service to develop and implement additional, exceptionally comprehensive measures to reduce risk to eagles to the level where it is essentially unavoidable.   Extending the permits will allow permit-holders, including wind farm operators, to provide conservation benefits for eagles while granting them a degree of legal and financial certainty critical to any business.   And this program is expressly designed to protect eagle populations by providing much-needed conservation benefits in exchange for very limited \"take\" authorization, after all steps have been taken to first avoid and minimize risk to eagles, and then fully offsetting that risk so the net effect on eagles is neutral or positive.This concept is not new. Congress authorized the permitting of the non-purposeful take of eagles that was incidental to otherwise lawful activities decades ago under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The current permit program was initiated under President George W. Bush and the rule finalized in 2009. The most recent change to the rule, extending the permit duration, makes it more consistent with the Endangered Species Act's permit program, widely considered to be the gold standard for wildlife protection, which already provides for life-of-activity authorization -- in some instances lasting 40-60 years -- for species that by their very definition are more imperiled than eagles. Those permits have allowed economic development while protecting wildlife.   With all of the above in mind, while eagles do unfortunately collide with turbines at some wind farms, it is not a common occurrence. Based on a review of all publicly available data, fatalities at modern wind facilities represent at most 2 percent of all documented sources of human-caused fatalities of golden eagles, and as noted, only a handful of bald eagles in over 30 years.  Yet the wind industry is committed to, and strives for, further reducing these impacts and does more to address risks to eagles than any of the other, far greater human sources of eagle fatalities that exist in the landscape today. For example, the Exxon Valdez oil spill immediately killed 247 bald eagles.   To obtain a permit, wind farm developers and operators need to engage in years of pre- and post-construction monitoring for wildlife impacts. They then make changes to the project design at the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, accept lost revenue from changes to facility layout and operations, and provide upfront mitigation for losses that may or may not occur (based on a highly conservative model that presently overestimates the risk). Through the permit mitigation permittees will help reduce the present impacts of other threats. And there are no guarantees that more will not be required of permit holders in the future, regardless of what is negotiated during the permit process. All this poses a business risk.   The administrative change allowing for permits of up to 30 years, with check-ins required at least every five years, will encourage these much-needed, long-term eagle conservation efforts, while allowing wind companies to increase the affordable and renewable energy they supply to American consumers. These permits will be difficult to qualify for and keep -- the result of much hard work with Audubon and other wildlife conservation groups to make sure they will work to the eagles' benefit -- no matter what Mr. Yarnold likes to claim.  Wind energy already reduces U.S. carbon dioxide pollution by nearly 100 million tons a year, and it's one of the most affordable and readily scalable ways to address climate change -- the single greatest threat to eagles and wildlife, say leading wildlife experts.   While reasonable people can disagree over what to do first, the latest revisions to the permit program are a major step forward for eagle protection and should be allowed to proceed without unreasonable attacks."}, {"title": "Baby Elephant Learns To Use Her Trunk.

Because elephant habitat is declining, wild elephants have increasingly been approaching villages and raiding crops. The Flying Squad gets deployed to both protect humans and herd wild elephants back into the forest before they get poisoned or killed.

For some, it's all about safe bike commutes and short trips; for others it's about the variety of recreational riding options. Many parents are concerned about finding even one appealing place to bike near home with their kids, while others can't access decent mountain biking trails without driving for hours. There are so many perspectives....PeopleForBikes focuses on improving the bicycling experience for everyone. But our work goes way beyond this general goal. We have developed key measures of progress: We call them 5X.By 2025, we want the total number of annual bike rides that Americans make to grow from 4 billion (the current figure) to 20 billion. That's 5X. Better bike infrastructure and safer, more appealing riding conditions will make this happen.By 2025, we want the number of protected bike lanes in U.S. cities to total 1,000 or more. As of today, about 200 of these lanes have been built, and most are well used and appreciated by riders of all ages and levels of experience.We envision five times the mileage of single track riding to be available and a 5X leap in the number of bike parks that provide dirt riding options for kids and kids-at-heart.We are focused on getting 5X the number of Americans to stand tall on behalf of bicycling. PeopleForBikes is about to pass 800,000 supporters, so we're talking about 4 million. That's a major movement with major political clout!Our work is guided by these (and other) 5X goals. All of them are based on what's working in the U.S. towns, cities, and states that are doing the best job of promoting bicycling. These are real numbers that are attainable -- if we all band together, get our friends and families involved, and think big.To achieve our 5X goals, we focus on four things here at PeopleForBikes:1. Building a grassroots army of support for better bicycling; 2. Developing a new group of leaders (elected officials, business CEOs, media movers, celebrities, and pro athletes) to endorse our goals and boost the grassroots effort; 3. Improving bike infrastructure through political work, sharing best practices, and cash grants that support actual projects and the best organizations that are working to make them happen. 4. Telling the story -- loud and clear -- about all the great things that happen when people ride bikes.5X. Four things. However you count it, we believe this is important work that benefits all Americans. We hope you agree.

And on December 26, President Obama signed the bill into law.Days later, on December 30, a Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) freight train owned by Warren Buffett carrying Bakken fracked oil exploded in Casselton, North Dakota. Locals breathed a smoky sigh of relief that the disaster happened outside the town center. In July 2013, a \"bomb train\" carrying Bakken oil exploded in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, killing 47 people.Dubbed the \"Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Streamlining Act,\" the bill passed unanimously in the Senate as S.244 and 415-1 in the House as H.R. 767, with Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) serving as the sole \"nay\" vote and 16 representatives abstaining. Among the abstentions were representatives Keith Defazio (D-OR), Henry Waxman (D-CA) and John Campbell (R-CA).H.R. 767's sponsor is North Dakota Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who received $213,150 from the oil and gas industry prior to the 2012 election, and an additional $29,000 for the forthcoming 2014 elections.Cosponsors include Wyoming Republican Rep.

It creates offices in North Dakota and Montana to rubber stamp fracking permits on public lands in those states.Section 365 created a \"Pilot Project to Improve Federal Permit Coordination\" on public lands \"to improve coordination of oil and gas permitting...as a means of meeting the Nation's need for dependable, affordable, environmentally responsible energy,\" explains the BLM website.This compelled BLM to set up field offices to more efficiently fast track oil and gas drilling permits in Rawlins and Buffalo, Wyoming; Miles City, Montana; Farmington and Carlsbad, New Mexico; Grand Junction/Glenwood Springs, Colorado; and Vernal, Utah.Left out of the original Section 365: North Dakota, the new darling of the U.S. domestic oil fracking scene.

The loophole also made the chemicals contained in \"fracking fluid\" a trade secret, meaning the industry doesn't have to disclose the recipe of chemicals injected into the ground in fracking operations.In March 2012, President Obama issued Executive Order 13604, lending an explanation to his signing off on the BLM Streamlining Act.Obama announced the Order while standing in front of the sections of pipe that would soon become the southern half of TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline (now rebranded the \"Gulf Coast Pipeline\") in Cushing, Oklahoma (the \"pipeline crossroads of the world\") -- a pipeline that will be fast-tracked by the Order.President Obama in Cushing; Photo Credit: White HouseBut it did much more than that, calling on the federal government to \"significantly reduce the aggregate time required to make decisions in the permitting and review of infrastructure projects.\"\"The quality of our Nation's infrastructure depends...on Federal permitting and review processes, including planning, aproval and consultation processes,\" explains the Obama Order. \"[I]t is critical that executive departments and agencies take all steps within their authority...to execute Federal permitting and review processes with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.\"Another key piece of that Order: creation of the Bakken Federal Executive Group.The Group was created to find \"ways to facilitate the development of oil and gas resources in the booming Bakken Formation,\" according to Petroleum News Bakken.\"Interior continues to be a leader in implementing President Obama's vision for a federal permitting process that is smarter [and] more efficient,\" David Hayes, Department of Interior Deputy Secretary said in a June press release on the Bakken Federal Executive Group. \"By coordinating across the many federal agencies involved in the Bakken region...we are able to offer a better process for industry.\"Just over a year later in May 2013, Obama issued a related follow-up memorandum to the Executive Order, calling for permitting time of major infrastructure projects to be cut in half.Speaking on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in May 2013, Cramer -- sponsor of the House version of the bill -- referred to the BLM Streamlining Act as a \"rather benign bill with rather major ramifications.\"Cramer also referred to North Dakota as the \"perfect laboratory\" for streamlining of permits on public lands, saying \"the North Dakota experiment will be one people look back on and say 'That's the way to do it, that's the right way to do it.'\"Remarking on the bill's passage, investor press outlet Motley Fool boasted, \"North Dakota's oil future just got brighter.\"Yet, not everyone's happy about the bill.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes 12 countries \u2013- the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei \u2013- and would govern a number of international environmental and trade issues.The draft indicates the pact will include a number of promises on the environment, but will lack strong enforcement tools. \"When compared against other TPP chapters, the Environment Chapter is noteworthy for its absence of mandated clauses or meaningful enforcement measures,\" wrote WikiLeaks in its release. The chapter is intended to deal with issues like overfishing, trade of wood products, wildlife crime, and illegal logging. But most of the measures in the chapter are voluntary, rather than binding, and do not include penalties or criminal sanctions for violations. Compliance is largely left to the respective countries.Enviros offered similar criticism. \"The lack of fully-enforceable environmental safeguards means negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers,\u201d said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, in a statement.The leaked document from November is only a draft, but if the trade pact's final environmental chapter looks like it, it would make the Obama administration's environmental trade record \"worse than George W. Bush\u2019s,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cThis draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues -- oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections -- and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts.\u201dAccording to a report from the chairs of the TPP Environmental Working Group drafting the chapter, also released by WikiLeaks, there remains significant disagreement among the parties on many of the pact's provisions. The chairs wrote that Vietnam, Peru and Malaysia object to a provision calling for countries to \"rationalize and phase out\" fossil fuel subsidies \"that encourage wasteful consumption.\" They also noted that the United States and Australia object to the climate change portion of the pact as it is written.Negotiation of the pact has been underway since 2010, but all discussions take place entirely outside of public view. The Obama administration has already received backlash for leaked portions of the pact that indicate it would grant greater rights to corporations to challenge national laws in private courts.Efforts to fast-track the trade deal met resistance from Democrats in Congress this week.UPDATE: 5:15 p.m. -- The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued a response to the release on Wednesday afternoon.From the statement:The United States' position on the environment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations is this: environmental stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or we will not come to agreement.Read the full statement here."}, {"title": "Montezuma, Costa Rica: Volunteering to Save Solitary Nesting Olive Ridley Sea Turtles", "text": "I have taken up residence in Costa Rica for a few weeks to do some exploring and research. Currently, I am tramping about sunny beaches near the funky seaside village of Montezuma on the southeastern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula where eco-tourists and beach buffs mingle among dreadlocked vendors. One of my present interests is the Olive Ridley Turtle.This morning I rose early and set out from the village for some morning exercise. Just as I started my hike along the beach I noticed two individuals on Montezuma Beach hunched over something of interest. I strolled over to investigate the investigators' find. To my good fortune, a crop of Olive Ridley Turtle hatchlings had excavated their way to the surface during the nighttime hours. They were emerging naturally just outside the fenced area of a protected hatchery.These turtles were unknown to me during my initial visits here more than a decade ago. But, in January 2009, I noticed for the first time a small turtle hatchery on the far end of an expansive beach called \"Playa Grande\" which is a good 35 minute hike from town over rugged volcanic outcroppings. I searched out the manager of the turtle project, Lenin Flores (Lenny), who was living along with a half-dozen international volunteers nearby in the Romelia Refuge.Lenny explained, \"I had been camping here In Montezuma for 32 years, but I didn't even know that the turtles nested here. Last year [early 2008], I came to supervise a project in the elementary school. People told me about the turtles. So, I contacted officials who were already looking for people to help.\" He subsequently took over responsibility for the turtle project on Playa Grande, hence the new hatchery.As well, the volunteers patrolled against poachers. Lenny explained, \"Tico's gather the eggs for food. Men think the eggs increase sexual virility. Although it is illegal, some are still sold on the black-market in San Jose.\"Adult Olive Ridley Turtles weigh about 100 pounds and measure anywhere from 22 to 31 inches in length. The tiny hatchlings by contrast weigh less than an ounce and are 1.5 inches long shell. Only about 1 in 1,000 hatchlings will survive to adulthood.During the first week of January, I witnessed first-hand their survival risk on the Osa Peninsula in southern Costa Rica near the border with Panama. The Osa is a primordial Eden of primary rainforest, rich in biodiversity from roots to treetop canopy. It is estimated that 2.5 percent of the world's biodiversity can be found on the Osa. In the pre-dawn hours, we were hiking along a beach on route to a sunrise kayaking outing in a brackish lagoon when our guide suddenly stopped. He followed a sculpted path landward. There as well, we found a half dozen Olive Ridley Turtle hatchlings that had just clawed their way to the surface after having spent 45 days in their subterranean incubator.This delayed our outing as the hatchlings waited for morning warmth before beginning their risky struggle across the open beach to begin their life at sea. A hawk standing nearby on the beach was annoyed by our presence since the hatchlings were its intended breakfast.Our guide carried the hatchlings a portion of the way, but then had to release them so that they \"could set their internal GPS for their return to this beach.\" We waited and watched. It was such a long, arduous journey. Eventually, two morning walkers came along and agreed to take up posts as turtle-sentries. As we were departed, a crab snatched one of the little ones, dragging it into its hole. Looking back, we observed a hawk snatch another one in spite of the sentries. At max, only 4 of those 6 made it to sea.Olive-shelled turtles are distributed in tropical regions around the globe. They often come ashore to nest in what is called an \"arribada\" meaning, they rest off-shore and then typically arrive in vast numbers all at once.Here in Montezuma, the numbers are not as large. Jennifer Adams -- the current Romelia Refuge Field Coordinator -- explained that the turtles here do \"solitary nesting\". During primary nesting season -- June/July to October/November -- there will be a maximum of 7 or 8 turtles per night. Each turtle lays about 80-100 eggs ping pong ball-sized eggs.Jennifer explained, \"Romelia is a privately funded and privately managed mixed wildlife refuge.\" It is an intimate affair between the solitary nesting turtles and volunteers who patrol the beach at night, gather the eggs, transfer them to the hatchery, and wait for the hatchlings to arrive.In 2011, the turtle project on Playa Grande and volunteer housing moved in-town. A new hatchery was set up on the contiguous Montezuma Beach. A maximum of 3 or 4 turtles arrive during primary nesting season on this beach. This fledgling project subsequently became affiliated with Costa Rica's Association of Volunteers for Service in Protected Areas (ASVO) which is a self-managed NGO. In addition to the turtle projects, ASVO volunteers also work with the local community in recycling, cleaning the beaches, and environmental education.Since it was logistically challenging to monitor turtle nesting on both beaches, the turtle project reopened on the more remote Playa Grande in 2012. Hence, Olive Ridley Turtles are now under the conservation eyes of two different organizations.Several days ago, I trekked out to Playa Grande and was taken back to see a dozen vultures crowded around two dead adult Ridley Turtles, gorging on their fetid carcasses. They likely fell victim to a fisherman's hook and line, or perhaps were drowned when trapped in a trawler's net. At a survival rate of 1 adult per 1000 hatchlings, the two carcasses visually represented what remained of 2,000 hatchlings from years past.It's a tough life for an Olive Ridley Turtle. We can thank the conservationists and volunteers at Montezuma for making life just a bit easier."}, {"title": "The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction", "text": "The first step in recovering from any addiction is to tell the truth -- admit the addiction, acknowledge its consequences. Yet this is something we still seem unwilling to do with our addiction to oil. Addicts would rather stay high than confront their addiction and commit to recovery.The truth about oil is that while there are benefits -- jobs, energy, government revenue -- there are also enormous long-term risks, impacts, and costs. While government and industry extoll the benefits of oil, they remain unwilling to tell the truth about its costs.Some costs are obvious. Oil spills, such as the 1989 Exxon Valdez in Alaska and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, are easily recognizable disasters that attract widespread public condemnation. Twenty-five years after the Alaska spill, the coastal ecosystem is still not fully recovered, and toxic oil remains in shoreline sediments. Many oil-producing areas of the world, such as the Niger Delta, the Caspian, and Siberia, have suffered decades of oil spills.But the true cost of oil goes far beyond the obvious damage from spills. More gradual, less visible costs of oil include ecological habitat degradation from exploration, production, and pipelines; health costs from breathing air polluted with fossil fuel emissions; urban sprawl and traffic congestion around all major cities of the world; and seemingly endless wars fought to secure oil supplies, like Iraq and Sudan, costing thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.Climate change from carbon emissions is incurring enormous present and future costs -- storm damage, drought, wildfires, lost agricultural productivity, infrastructure damage, climate refugees, disease, forest decline, marine ecosystem collapse, species extinctions, and lost ecosystem services. Global climate change costs already exceed $1 trillion a year, and will continue to rise.  And wherever it is produced, there is a \"socio-political toxicity\" of oil, a significant distortion of economic, social, and political systems. Rather than the prosperity promised, oil discoveries around the world often become more curse than blessing, causing social dysfunction, assimilation of indigenous cultures, runaway inflation, a decline in traditional exports, overconsumption, abuse of power, overextended government spending, and unsustainable growth. Former Venezuelan oil minister Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, a founder of OPEC and once a true believer in the promise of oil, thought differently after he saw the corruption, greed, waste, and debt it caused, then calling oil \"the devil's excrement.\"World oil use continues to rise, last year hitting a historic high of 91 million barrels a day, and still climbing. To date, the world has pumped and burned about 1 trillion barrels of oil, and there may be another trillion barrels of recoverable \"conventional\" oil left, with several trillion barrels in unconventional reserves such as tar sands and oil shale, like the huge Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.But if we want anything resembling a sustainable future, we'll have to leave most of this oil buried right where it is, as the global climate cannot handle this much additional carbon. The carbon-pushers see billions of dollars just waiting to be produced, and are anxious to get to it. As with any addiction, when the easy stuff is gone and supplies tighten, addicts become desperate and willing to take more risk to secure the next fix, such as drilling in the Arctic and deep ocean basin.While president George W. Bush stunned the world in his 2006 State of Union speech, stating that: \"we have a serious problem, America is addicted to oil,\" his administration did little to wean us from the addiction. And despite candidate Obama's promise to end \"the tyranny of oil,\" and that, if elected, \"the rise of the oceans will begin to slow,\" as president, Obama sounds more of an oil enthusiast, recently boasting: \"We're opening up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources offshore. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the Earth, and then some.\" He is poised to approve the contentious Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta tar sands, what climate scientists say may be be \"game over\" in efforts to stabilize climate. The tyranny of oil continues, and seas continue to rise.Oil-producing governments the world over -- including the U.S. and states of Alaska, Louisiana, Texas, and North Dakota -- are 'captured' and controlled by oil interests that dictate policies to limit regulation, lower taxation, and to favor production and demand for oil over development of low-carbon alternatives. The 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United ruling now allows oil companies to pour unlimited funds into oil-friendly candidates and issues, without public disclosure. Media is awash in ads keeping us hooked on the stuff. U.S. oil production has steadily increased since 2008, largely from oil shale, prompting calls from some to lift the export ban. Clearly, the drug pushers are running the show.The International Monetary Fund reports that governments encourage our fossil fuel addiction with annual subsidies of some $1.9 trillion, including $480 billion per year in direct subsidies. Such subsidies artificially depress prices and encourage overconsumption; detract from government spending on health care, education, and social services; and keep alternative energy \"uncompetitive.\" A 1998 study estimated that for every gallon of gasoline we bought at the pump, we were actually paying as much as $14 a gallon in additional \"hidden\" costs. Yet, we continue to ignore these hidden costs, paying for some indirectly through income taxes, and deferring most to future generations. We are tricking ourselves into using cheap and easy oil as fast as we can pump it out of the ground.And perhaps the most pernicious cost of oil is that it has fueled an unprecedented degradation of the global biosphere. With access to artificially \"cheap and easy\" oil over the past century, human population has quadrupled and resource consumption has increased many times more, now significantly exceeding Earth's carrying capacity. Without access to fossil carbon, humanity would almost certainly have evolved on a more sustainable trajectory. But by not accounting for its true cost, oil has allowed us to dig ourselves deeper into an unsustainable hole. The environmental debt we are accruing is far larger and more consequential than our national financial debt.It's high time we kicked the habit, with better regulation and full costing of carbon. The full \"social cost of carbon\" has been estimated by the federal government at $50 - $100 per ton of CO2, and with global emissions now exceeding 39 billion tons per year, this amounts to $2 trillion - $4 trillion annually. When we account for these very real costs, sustainable alternatives become competitive, and we make more rational choices.In the U.S., oil consumption has declined slightly in recent years, due in large part to the high price of oil, increased availability of natural gas, and government-mandated increases in vehicle fuel efficiency. Governments need to accelerate this trend by shifting fossil fuel subsidies to sustainable low-carbon alternatives, reducing emissions through regulation, and instituting a carbon tax to help capture the long-term cost of carbon.Sooner or later, we will get to the far side of our troubled oil addiction, as we will run out of the stuff. But the sooner we get there, the better chance we have at a sustainable future.

It will be the third in a series by the IPCC, updating science from 2007.It says the world is doing too little to achieve a goal agreed in 2010 of limiting warming to below 2 degrees (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, seen as a threshold for dangerous floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.To get on track, governments may have to turn ever more to technologies for \"carbon dioxide removal\" (CDR) from the air, ranging from capturing and burying emissions from coal-fired power plants to planting more forests that use carbon to grow.Most projects for capturing carbon dioxide from power plants are experimental. Among big projects, Saskatchewan Power in Canada is overhauling its Boundary Dam power plant to capture a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.And, if the world overshoots concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere consistent with the 2C goal, most scenarios for getting back on track \"deploy CDR technologies to an extent that net global carbon dioxide emissions become negative\" before 2100, it says.Temperatures have already risen by 0.8C (1.4F) since the Industrial Revolution.BIOENERGYTo limit warming, the report estimates the world would have to invest an extra $147 billion a year in low-carbon energies, such as wind, solar or nuclear power from 2010 to 2029.At the same time, investments in fossil fuel energy would have to be reduced by $30 billion annually. And several hundred billion dollars a year would have to go on energy efficiency in major sectors such as transport, buildings and industry.By contrast, it said that global annual investments in the energy system are now about $1.2 trillion.And it says there are huge opportunities for cleaning up, for instance by building cities that use less energy for a rising world population. \"Most of the world's urban areas have yet to be constructed,\" it says.Overall, the report estimates that the costs of combating global warming would reduce global consumption of goods and services by between 1 and 4 percent in 2030, 2-6 percent in 2050 and 2-12 percent in 2100, compared to no action.The IPCC said in September that it is at least 95 percent probable that human activities, led by the burning of fossil fuels, are the dominant cause of global warming since the 1950s, up from 90 percent in a 2007 assessment.The world has agreed to work out a global U.N. deal by the end of 2015, entering into force from 2020, to fight climate change. But progress has been sluggish.\"Global greenhouse gases have risen more rapidly between 2000 and 2010,\" the draft says, with greater reliance on coal than in previous decades. China, the United States and the European Union are the top emitters.The IPCC cautioned that the findings in the draft, dated Dec. 17, were subject to change. \"This is a work in progress which will be discussed and revised in April,\" said Jonathan Lynn, spokesman for the IPCC in Geneva.The report adds many details to earlier drafts. The IPCC's credibility suffered in 2007 after one of its reports wrongly said that Himalayan glaciers could all melt by 2035, centuries earlier than experts reckon.The draft says that only the most radical curbs outlined in an IPCC report in September would give a better than 66 percent chance of keeping temperature rises below 2C. The scenario corresponds to greenhouse gas concentrations of 430 to 480 parts per million in the atmosphere - up from about 400 now.

And Thursday, some 50 workers marched on practice picket lines in front of the Buchanan plants as a final step in preparation for a strike.\"They had signs and union paraphernalia,\" said Melia. \"It was an exercise showing that the unionized workers are serious about obtaining a fair contract. We authorize strikes because that is one of the few tools left to us, and we use it to show that we are serious.\"That said, no one ever wants a strike. No one wins in a strike.\"The negotiating teams of the Utility Workers and Entergy will be joined by Commissioners Peter Donatello and Martin Callaghan of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) who seek to facilitate discussions and avert a strike. The Service is an independent government agency which provides mediating service when requested.Agency spokesman John Arnold said \"we are responding to a joint request from the parties involved.\" The actual mediation process is secret, he added, and the commissioners will not be providing status reports to the public. Entergy declined to comment.Melia said there were no particular sticking points, but the company and union differed on wages and benefits, particularly the level of employee contributions to health care.\"It's been a pattern in collective bargaining the last few years,\" Melia said, \"that big corporations like to throw their weight around. They seek an increase in member contributions to health care spending. They seem to think that the costs are going through the roof and it's another thing that employers seize upon to nickel and dime the workers.\"But a strike would be hard on the workers. There were some 1,500 union workers in 2001 when Entergy bought Indian Point 2 from Consolidated Edison, and Indian Point 3 from the New York Power Authority. As the plants were consolidated Entergy eliminated many positions and others were converted over time to non-union positions.With membership at about 375 - just 25% of what it was before Entergy bought the plants - Local 1-2 does not have the numbers and income to maintain a strike fund. In 1978, when Melia was a reporter at the New York Daily News, the strike fund of the New York Newspaper Guild paid each member a small stipend for the duration of the four-month strike.But with the utility union's diminished numbers, Melia said, \"We are not in a position to provide benefits to our members. We have funds to carry out our day to day functions as a union, but we do not have a strike fund to service the members.\"It is also a tough economic period for Entergy. The talks with its unionized workers take place at a time when the nuclear industry is facing severe financial challenges due to competition from low-priced natural gas. The huge amounts of gas produced in recent years by hydraulic fracturing have altered the dynamics of the electricity marketplace. Entergy Nuclear Northeast is closing its Vermont Yankee plant - which received a 20-year license extension in 2011 - because it is no longer profitable.Neither is Entergy's James A. FitzPatrick nuclear plant in upstate New York.-- Continue reading at Energy Matters."}, {"title": "West Virginia Spill Exposes Disturbing Lack Of Data About Hazardous Chemicals", "text": "The 300,000 residents of nine West Virginia counties affected by last Thursday's chemical spill are slowly starting to get notice that they can turn on their taps again. But many are still wondering why they didn't have more information about the potential dangers in their own backyard.As much as 7,500 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (also known as crude MCHM) spilled into the Elk River about a mile and a half upstream from where the West Virginia American Water utility draws its supply. The coal-cleaning chemical came from a storage facility owned by Freedom Industries and located in Charleston, the state capital.Angie Rosser, executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, lives along the Elk River upstream from the spill. Even though she works on environmental issues and drives by the storage facility regularly, she said she had no idea that the tanks held chemicals. \"They just look old and rusty,\" Rosser told The Huffington Post. \"I just couldn't have imagined. If I knew, our organization certainly would have raised questions about this.\"\"But we are in the same boat as the rest of the public, the water company and apparently our governor,\" Rosser said. \"No one seemed to be aware or care that this dangerous chemical was upstream from our largest drinking water intake in the state. It was a recipe for disaster.\"That seems to be the resounding complaint in West Virginia: No one knew. The chemicals were disclosed in a filing to the state last year, reporting that the facility could hold anywhere between 11.4 million and 63.5 million pounds of 10 different chemicals on a given day, including up to 1 million pounds of MCHM. The forms were filed in compliance with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, a 1986 federal law designed to make sure plans are in place in case of an accident. MCHM was listed on the Tier II reporting form as a \"hazardous\" material under the Environmental Protection Agency's classification system. But there doesn't seem to have been a plan in place in case of an accident, as the Charleston Gazette has reported, and the public didn't know the chemicals were there.West Virginia lies in the heart of coal country, which means MCHM is likely kept in not insignificant quantities at storage and preparation facilities across the state. Moreover, after the chemical is used to wash the coal, the tainted wastewater is often injected into old mines or stored in above-ground impoundments.Yet finding out where else such chemicals are stored in the state is difficult, environmental advocates say. The forms disclosing the chemicals are filed with the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Communications director Lawrence Messina said the department keeps the past five years of filings, but most of them are on paper -- because most of the roughly 9,500 facilities in the state that file these reports still turn them in that way. Electronic filing has only recently become an option, and the department itself does not offer a publicly available online database. Individuals can request a filing for a particular facility, presuming they know of its existence, and county emergency planners keep copies of the filings for their local sites. So some information exists, but there's no easy way to search it by location or chemical.Coal field activists warn that while the spill in Charleston is a big deal, many in the state could potentially be exposed to the chemical on a daily basis. \"It's a big emergency here based on the fact that 300,000 people's water source was polluted, but the story here is that coal companies use this chemical and other chemicals in West Virginia every day,\" said Bill Price, a West Virginia-based organizer with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign.West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin (D) tried to put some distance between the coal industry and the spill. \u201cThis was not a coal company incident,\" Tomblin said. \"This was a chemical company incident.\"But Price said that's not much of a distinction. \"Let's be honest, the reason it was stored in Charleston is its proximity to coal-producing areas,\" said Price. And he added, \"We don\u2019t know where else this chemical may be stored.\"Safety concerns related to MCHM and other chemicals used by the coal industry have been raised before. Residents in several parts of the state have filed lawsuits regarding the underground disposal of coal slurry, which can contain MCHM and a number of other chemicals. Plaintiffs from Mingo County reached a settlement with Massey Energy in July 2011 after alleging that 1.4 billion gallons of coal slurry had contaminated their groundwater. More than 350 residents of Boone County reached a settlement over coal slurry contamination claims in June 2012.Jack Spadaro, a former superintendent of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy (a program of the U.S. Department of Labor), testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in both those cases. He said that the use of MCHM is fairly common in the state. \"It's used in virtually every coal preparation plant in the coal fields, this chemical or something like it,\" he said.Concerns about potentially tainted groundwater prompted the state to put a moratorium on new underground slurry injection sites in 2009, though underground injection is still allowed at sites that already had permits.And the problem is not confined to MCHM. Finding out how many major chemical facilities there are and the quantities of any chemicals they store is hard, said Maya Nye, spokesperson for the citizen group People Concerned About Chemical Safety.Nye has advocated for tougher chemical oversight and transparency rules in the state for years, following two previous incidents: an August 2008 explosion at a Bayer CropScience plant that killed two workers and a January 2010 toxic release at a DuPont facility that killed one person. But the state failed to put in place tougher rules, even after the U.S. Chemical Safety Board recommended them, the Gazette reported.To find out how many chemical facilities with \"extremely hazardous\" substances -- that is, those deemed more dangerous than the merely \"hazardous\" MCHM -- were located in her area, Nye had to go to the EPA's reading room in Washington, D.C., and take handwritten notes on all the risk management plans filed for the region. Photocopying and photographs were not allowed.Many of the area facilities that reported extremely hazardous chemicals \"were not on my radar,\" said Nye. Even for the ones that were, she was surprised by the volumes stored on site. \"I was not aware of the amount of danger we were in,\" she said.The two previous chemical incidents did not, however, lead to changes in state laws regarding chemical safety and public reporting. \"I don\u2019t think there's any major political interest in trying to more heavily regulate the coal or the chemical industry in our state, because they are huge economic engines,\" said Nye.Maybe the latest MCHM spill will prompt reforms.\"The fact that 300,000 people are exposed means that someone is probably going to be willing to champion it now,\" said Nye. \"I don\u2019t want to have to wait for disaster to occur to get on top of things, but that seems like that's the only way we deal with things in this state or this country.\""}, {"title": "Tokyo Electric Power Co's Revival Plan To Be Approved, Officials Announce", "text": "TOKYO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry said it would approve on Wednesday a revival plan for the utility responsible for the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Tokyo Electric Power Co, its second attempt at restoring battered finances.The plan hinges on Tokyo Electric (Tepco) restarting its Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant to cut fossil fuel costs, a contentious issue staunchly opposed by the local governor.An earlier plan by Tepco outlining a revival after its Fukushima plant was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011, triggering triple meltdowns at the site, had to be torn up because it could not restart Kashiwazaki.Japan's trade minister Toshimitsu Motegi is scheduled to meet Tepco president at 1700 JST on Wednesday to officially approve the plan.Tepco is also pledging to cut costs by reducing fuel spending and forming partnerships with other utilities, as well as upgrading fossil fuel plants, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Wednesday. The company is majority owned by the government after an earlier bailout.Tepco's previous revival plan revolved around a Kashiwazaki restart in early 2013. The new plan envisages a restart of two reactors at the station in July and the utility hopes all seven reactors will go online by fiscal 2016.The disaster at Fukushima, the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 eventually brought about the halt of all nuclear power plants in Japan so they could be vetted under tougher new standards.Opposition to atomic power remains strong in the country and is set to become a major issue in an election next month for governorship of metropolitan Tokyo, which owns a stake in Tepco.Most candidates are opposed to restarting nuclear power plants and one, former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa has received the strong backing from Junichiro Koizumi, one of Japan's most popular leaders, who ruled between 2001 and 2006.In the nearly three years since the disaster, the utility has been plagued by a string of setbacks at the Fukushima station north of Tokyo, including leaks of highly radioactive water last year, prompting the government to step in with more support.The local governor in Niigata, where Kashiwazaki is located, has been a vocal opponent of Tepco's management and has questioned whether the company has the ability to operate a nuclear station, following the failings in its preparation and response to the disaster. He has publicly called for the Tepco's liquidation.Tepco is aiming to have all seven reactors at the Niigata plant, the world's biggest atomic station, operating by fiscal year 2016."}, {"title": "Bee-Killing Poisons Contaminate Water: More Evidence", "text": "My recent passionate broadcast across Australia on the 'War Against Nature' elicited many emails especially from children. They all wanted to know: \"Why are adults killing nature?\"What kind of a world are we leaving for our children?Since 2009 I've been writing about the plight of beleaguered honeybees due to toxic chemicals; over five billion pounds of insecticides -- one third of them are lethal neonicotiniods (neonics) thrust into our biosphere each year.More and more people are becoming vegetarians and choosing not to eat food doused in chemicals. What safe choices are you making for your family?Neonics are a neuro-active insecticide fashioned after nicotine, neonics poison nerves and prevent acetylcholine from enabling neurons to communicate with each other and muscle tissue. In humans, this substance would trigger Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.Over 10 million commercial beehives have died since 2008 -- this is an epic worldwide problem.My colleague Dr Henk Tennekes reported the deadly effects of neonics on both soil organisms and their 'knock-on-effects' causing starvation to meadow birds and their predators Goshawks as well as contaminating waterways for many years thereafter across Western Europe.It seems that his thorough research was blatantly disregarded elsewhere around the globe by feckless government regulatory bodies. An intrepid Dr Christy Morrissey of the University of Saskatchewan set out to investigate just how wide spread the effects of neonics were across the prairies of Western Canada. Eighty to 90 percent of the wetlands she studied were contaminated with these odious poisons, which remain in toxic concentrations within the waterways for years. She too found 'knock-on-effects' in soils extending up the food chain, which reduced populations of many animals.Earthlings are knowingly annihilating the exquisite tapestry of life or Earth's biodiversity. The strength of an ecosystem depends upon the diversity of species. By killing biodiversity, we are killing ourselves; and it's happening very quickly, globally.Dr Morrissey asked some poignant questions about the food we currently produce on our globe: \"Is that the cost, no birds? Or having no butterflies? Or having no bees?\"Every home could easily have at least one apple tree and a small garden. There's no better way to ensure that your children are healthy than by growing your own food.It would appear that the human race believes it does not need to coexist with nature; this, however, could not be farther from the real truth. A recent study discovered that the demand for honeybees in 41 European countries between 2005 and 2010 grew five fold whilst half of those countries don't have enough honeybees to pollinate their food crops. Some countries like the U.K. were in far worse shape because they only have one quarter of the necessary honeybees to feed 63.3 million people.So far, nature and her glorious wild bees have graciously picked up the slack of the dying honeybees by pollinating the lion's share of our food crops worldwide.There are over 1,500 species of tiny wild bees on the Australian continent -- they are indefatigable workers.   But how much longer can nature withstand this relentless bee-killing chemical assault?This we know: Wild bees die from exposure to neonics, unless there is a worldwide ban on the 1,000 kinds of neonics -- wild bees will die, too, and the world's food supply will plummet, rapidly.Is this the world we intend on leaving, starving children begging?Last May (2013) amidst over 500 billion commercial honeybee deaths over the past six years alone with a $2B price-tag for beekeepers, the EPA green-lighted another neonic called Sulfoxaflor.It is thrilling and humbling to know that honeybees communicate through an elaborate dance. Have you ever seen the bee-waggle? If not, why not?I urge you to take a few moments and write your political representative(s) and tell them to ban neonics. Please support Saving America's Pollinator Act as our future depends upon it.There are about 2.4 million commercial beehives in America responsible for feeding 313 million people. The time is now for lawmakers to ban neonics and safeguard our food supply especially since global warming is adding further stresses to an antiquated agricultural system stretched to its maximum.Our children's legacy - biodiversity - is at perilous risk from these pernicious poisons!Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and the author of The Incomparable Honeybee."}, {"title": "Rare Monk Seal Pup Is Born On Hawaii Beach, Entire State Dies From Cuteness", "text": "Forget the first baby born in 2014, Hawaii is all abuzz about the first monk seal pup born in the new year.The Hawaiian monk seal is the second-most endangered marine mammal in the United States -- their population is currently hovering around 1,100 -- so when a new one is born, it's as celebrated as a royal birth.The mother of 2014's newest pup is known as \"Honey Girl.\" She frequently hangs out on Oahu's North Shore and lucky onlookers were able to witness her giving birth near Turtle Bay last week.Sadly, newborn monk seals only have a 20% chance of survival. Their mothers stay on the beach with them for about six weeks to nurse, but then leave them to fend for themselves. When the pups' mothers leave, they crave affection, turning to sea turtles, branches, and even humans for hugs. Roughly 200 monk seals live around the inhabited Hawaiian islands, and humans tend to be their biggest threat.\"Honey Girl\" knows this threat all too well. In 2012, she was found near death with a fish hook in her cheek and a badly infected tongue.\"When we got out to see her, she was in terrible shape, was severely emaciated,\" Rachel Sprague, Assistant Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Hawaii News Now. \"There was a reasonable expectation that she was not going to make it.\"\"Honey Girl was nursed back to health, however, and proved to be very resilient.\"For her to go from the condition she was in to now being a mom again and contributing to her species recovery is very exciting,\" Sprague said.We hope \"Honey Girl\" can pass on some of that resiliency and strength to her newborn.Conservation efforts for Hawaiian monk seals continue through NOAA, the California-based Marine Mammal Center, and the Hawaii-based Monk Seal Foundation."}, {"title": "Judging Thy Neighbor Isn't Helping the Environment, You Jerk", "text": "Hey, environmental advocates, we need to talk.It's your attitude.

That is, until Beyonc\u00e9 went to a vegan restaurant wearing a coat with a fur collar, and the Internet exploded with scorn. Eighty-four percent of Ecouterre readers declared her hypocritical and offensive.Let's all calm down, guys. She is giving the vegan diet a shot, grabbed her favorite coat on the way out the door, and wanted to get a nice dinner. Was it a little tone deaf? Yes. Poor planning? Sure. Is she a hypocrite? No! She's just a human, muddling her way through being a good person. Like we all are.And then there was one of my favorite musical artists, Grimes, who decided to take a break from veganism for a day to eat (fair trade, made-from-humanely-raised-cows, percentage-of-profits-donated-to-charity, eco-friendly) Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Judging by the tenor of commenters on her off-the-cuff post, you would have thought she said, \"I decided to try cannibalism today.\" Her response:\"I like to encourage people towards a type of veganism that is inviting and accepting. For the longest time I was vegan but I just wouldn't say I was because of the bad reputation of veganism. Most of the vegans i know are dogmatic *ssholes, and it completely turns people off. My brand of veganism is one wherein if your grandparents have no idea what you are talking about then you eat their beef stew rather than upset or confuse them. Or if you really want to have cake with an egg in it on the holidays then you have that rather than just not being a vegan because you don't want to give up occasionally having something that you love.\"Preach, girlfriend.This you're-going-to-burn-in-a-hell attitude isn't exclusive to vegans. The broader environmental category of do-gooders can be the same way. Those who care about the Earth can be judge-y and dogmatic in the name of advancing the cause. And some love to play the gotcha game. Al Gore has a big house that requires lots of energy! You had to fly to get to that eco-friendly resort! Ooohh, I found some bleach under your kitchen sink! (Seriously, I once had an apoplectic commenter excoriate me for eating chocolate.)It's especially bad when it comes to corporations. As soon as any corporation sticks its neck out and takes a step forward to more sustainable and ethical business practices, the blame game begins. When Chipotle, who tries to source local and organic ingredients and even gives its employees organic t-shirts to wear, made a beautiful commercial about factory farming, Grist turned on the snark spigot, saying it was \"brainwashing\" consumers, and encouraging them to \"buy more shit.\" Ugh, spare me.I'm loathe to stand up for the big guy, but this kind of attitude is holding us back. Yes, greenwashing is rampant and companies should be called out when they fail to make good on their promises. And you have every right to be raging angry at companies that lobby, lie, obfuscate and knowingly poison us and the environment. But when McDonald's says they want to start sourcing sustainable meat, let's say, \"That's a great idea. Let's talk about what that means,\" instead of skewering them for even trying. I can just imagine an executive at a large corporation saying, \"Well, I would love to phase out our use of chemicals and publicize it, but we can't because then we'll get slammed for X Y and Z. It's just not worth it.\" How many times has that conversation happened high up in a boardroom? That's a shame.When we do this as an environmental community, we send a message that you shouldn't even try. Don't bother eating organic, unless you'll also move to a smaller home, buy a hybrid, throw out all your conventional beauty products and replace them with homemade tinctures, plant a vegetable garden, only buy from thrift stores, never eat fast food again, donate 40 percent of your disposable income to the National Resource Defense Council, etc, etc.If you take this eco-friendlier-than-thou attitude to its logical conclusion, no one is environmentally friendly. Unless, of course, you live in a log cabin with no electricity and provide all your own organic food from within five miles. Even Colin Beavan of No Impact Man fame, who labored through a year with reusable diapers, no dinners at restaurants, and no toilet paper, had a little bit of an impact. At the end, he skipped a trip to visit his in-laws because he felt so guilty about getting on a plane. Is that a good way to live? I mean, you could just kill yourself to fertilize the soil. There's that.I'm not a big fan of water bottles. But when I see people walking down the street with a water bottle, I don't assume they're a self-involved jerk who doesn't care about the environment. Maybe there were no water fountains and they forgot their reusable water bottle. Maybe the water bottle was given to them free at a conference. Maybe they're a tourist and no one told him New York City water is clean and delicious. Maybe, they've never even learned about the impact of water bottles before, and how bottled water can be even dirtier than tap water. My role is to carry a reusable bottle of water with me. Plus, I keep a pitcher of tap water in my refrigerator (filtered using this eco-friendly charcoal method), and tell my guests from out of town that NYC water is great and please help themselves.There's a middle ground. There's they guy who needs a truck for work and shops at Whole Foods. There's the environmentalist who loves living in the city and can't always make it out to the hiking trail. (Me.) There's the mom who wants to feed her children healthy food, but chooses to spend the family's extra money on activities and classes instead of organics. Every step toward a more sustainable lifestyle is good, and should be celebrated instead of used as moral ammo against us.This nice little poster says it all.Let's be kind and encouraging to each other. Yes, let's educate each other and have discussions. But let's not be an asshat.You know I'm not perfect. I put an enormous amount of time and effort into living sustainably. I spend more on sustainable and organic clothing. I buy organic and local food. I seek out farm-to-table restaurants. I carry a reusable bottle and bag around with me at all times. I'll take a 35-minute walk before I hail a cab.But I also love Reese's peanut butter cups. I have white linens and bleach them. Sometimes I go to the nail salon, and I've forgotten my toxin-free polish and -- gasp -- I get a conventional manicure. When my aunt goes out to buy freshly-made croissants, I didn't sniff them and ask, with disdain, if they are organic. I eat a freakin' croissant because she bought them for me out of love.And it's just unfair to get mad at individuals. Get mad at the system instead. Get mad at the fact that it's easier and cheaper to buy processed food. Get mad at the fact that there are less than a half-dozen nail salons in NYC that use non-toxic nail polishes and 700 that smell like cancer. Get mad at the fact that it's nearly impossible to live your life free of plastic. Get made at ordering in and getting four plastic-wrapped fork and knife sets with it. Unless you make it feasible for everyone to live your version of a perfect lifestyle, it's unfair to get mad at people to ask them to spend more and jump through hoops to get there. It's much more useful to support a plastic bag ban in your city, then glare your neighbor down when he totes his groceries inside with plastic bags. Given the choice between supporting the passage of the Chemical Safety Improvement Act and telling my sister she's a bad mom for buying conventional baby products, I'll choose the former. (She's a great mom, by the way.)So be encouraging to your friends and family. Bring organic wine to the party. Suggest an amazing farm-to-table restaurant for dinner. Pin looks from your favorite sustainable designers all over Pinterest. Invite your friends on a hike.

For others, however, the waiting isn't over.\"Not having water is unsettling, but after 5 days without it is overwhelmingly so,\" Lori Scott, who lives in West Virginia's Kanawha County, told HuffPost via email on Tuesday afternoon. \"There are many who are helping people to get water everywhere, but it is enough for a little cooking, washing a few dishes and some for personal hygiene.

The only differences are that I'm using the regular tub in a bathroom as opposed to a metal tub in the kitchen, and I'm using bottled water rather than rain water.\"Taylor said her 80-year-old father, who undergoes dialysis three times a week in Charleston, had his treatment delayed for nearly six hours on Friday until a truck could arrive with water.

I spoke at one of these meetings in Washington DC today, before a panel chaired by David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA). Here's what I said:Members of the Working Group, thank you for listening to citizens today.My name is David Halperin, and I live in this city. I'm a former staff member of the White House National Security Council and the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I work now as an attorney and policy advocate. I'm a part-time consultant to Greenpeace, an organization I have worked with for many years. Greenpeace is part of the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, over 100 organizations concerned about the environment, environmental justice, workers, public health, and national security. Our groups have for years urged the government to take action to move chemical plants toward safer chemicals and processes.We're here, in part, because of the recent deadly chemical plant explosions in West, Texas, and elsewhere.None of us should ignore the possibility of more accidents, with even more violent consequences.Many of us here recall the 1984 pesticide plant disaster at Bhopal, India, which caused 20,000 deaths.All of us remember the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.None of us should ignore the possibility that terrorists could trigger a chemical plant attack in our country, with consequences like Bhopal, 9-11, or even worse.In 2003, a government panel warned that chemical plants in the US could be al Qaeda targets. Media investigations have highlighted weak or nonexistent security at these facilities, with gates unlocked and chemical tanks unguarded.You know that the EPA has found that more than 470 chemical facilities in the U.S. each put 100,000 or more people at risk of a poison gas disaster.I've heard Obama administration officials describe chemical plant safety as a national security issue. I find that encouraging. It is a national security issue that poses a real threat to our people, just as, say, Iran's nuclear program does.The strongest statement of the threat was made by Barack Obama. As a senator he referred to chemical plants as \"stationary weapons of mass destruction spread all across the country.\"But if this is a national security issue, you need to treat it like you really believe it is a national security issue, with the kind of urgency we give to weapons of mass destruction overseas.Rick Hind of Greenpeace and I wrote an op-ed on this topic in the New York Times ten years ago, and, despite some positive steps, the problems we described are nearly the same as they are now. The government has done too little in those 10 years to address these dangers.I understand that the challenge of requiring companies to move to safer technologies is complex. But it can be done, as some companies already have demonstrated.The bigger challenge is political -- the power of wealthy companies and their lobbyists, who use campaign contributions and expenditures as weapons to block reforms. Again, it was Senator Obama who said it best: \"We cannot allow chemical industry lobbyists to dictate the terms of this debate. We cannot allow our security to be hijacked\" by special interests.This challenge, too, can be overcome. And it must be overcome.I'm grateful that the president has ordered federal agencies to address this threat.But you must act decisively.

Over the past month, the company has confirmed at least 11 spills and was slapped with a $3.1 million fine from the country's Environmental Management Authority last week, which the company's president, Khalid Hassanali, called \"harsh.\"(Story continues below)Here's where it gets weird.The pipeline responsible for the first of the leaks at Petrotrin's Point-a-Pierre facility, which resulted in an initial spill of more than 7,000 barrels, may not have undergone any inspections for the past 17 years, according to a confidential report commissioned by the company and obtained by the Trinidad Guardian. Of the other 10 leaks, Petrotrin has accused saboteurs of causing at least 2 while releasing a series of media releases praising what they describe as \"significant progress\" during clean-up efforts, saying the beaches would be clean one to two weeks after the spill.Petrotrin did not return requests for comment in time for publication.However, local officials have accused the company of trying to downplay the extent and size of the spill, according to the Trinidad Express. Two former energy ministers also came forward earlier this month, saying Petrotrin did know about the state of its aging infrastructure after a government audit was ordered in 2010.\"There was no question of sabotage, it was all a question of bad operations on the part of Petrotrin,\" MP Paula Gopee-Scoon said. \u201cIt was a cover-up from day one.\u201dPetrotrin has since used the controversial dispersant Corexit 9500 to control the spill, used in record quantities by BP during 2010's Gulf oil spill.

But government officials have demanded the Minister of Energy commission an independent investigation into the cause of the spill \"by people who don\u2019t have anything to protect and no rear end to cover.\"Trinidad's energy department approved a new national oil spill contingency plan in January 2013.UPDATE: Jan. 22 -- Contrary to media reports of there being 11 spills, Trinidad's Environmental Management Authority released a statement on Jan. 17 claiming there have been only four that have impacted 12 locations and 10.5 miles of beach.Take a look at more photos below:"}, {"title": "Innovation Earth: This Could Be 'The Future Of Urban Transportation'", "text": "The number of people living in cities is expected to double in the next 30 to 40 years. By 2050, seven out of every 10 people living on Earth will call themselves an urbanite. So how will we navigate the throng?If the post-apocalyptic-esque air pollution in Beijing has taught us anything, it's that conventional cars will not be an option. (This past Saturday saw the highest toxicity levels to date, a \"Beyond Index\" 755 on a scale that ends at 500.) And switching to pollution-free cars won't eliminate the ever-increasing problem of urban traffic congestion, which will worsen as our numbers continue to rise.One hope on the horizon: The San Francisco start-up Scoot Networks, which has brought the concept of car sharing to electric scooters. With a regular drivers license, riders can rent the smartphone-activated scooters by the hour or day to run errands, commute to work, even take a joyride around the city (albeit a slow and ostensibly safe one, since the scooters, or scoots, as the company calls them, top out at 30 mph). Prices are reasonable; a basic plan lets you ride for up to an hour for $5.Scoot launched at the end of September 2012 with 20 scooters in four locations; now, the company has 36 scooters and 12 locations with plans to expand in the coming year, and recently nabbed $1.7 million in additional funding.Car-bound Angeleno that I am, navigating a city via scooter sounded incredibly freeing, so I planned on taking a scoot for a spin in San Francisco over the holidays. Alas, my travel plans fell through, so I turned to the next best thing: An interview with Scoot Networks CEO and founder Michael Keating.Jennifer Grayson: Alright, Michael, let's pretend I actually made it up to San Francisco and want to test out a scoot. What's the learning curve for someone who's never been on a scooter?Michael Keating: It's super easy. We've taught over 2,000 people to ride the scoots. Most of them had never ridden a scooter or motorcycle before.JG: So how long before I'm actually up and riding?MK: When someone joins Scoot, they take what we call orientation. The first time you ride, you meet with one of our instructors and maybe one or two other new riders. In your case, if you have no experience, it takes about 45 minutes.JG: So 45 minutes until it's just me and the streets of San Francisco?MK: It's really important to know that these aren't motorcycles; they're mopeds. Legally in California, they're mopeds if they can't go more than 30 mph and have only 2 horsepower. They're really tame, really user-friendly vehicles that are super easy to learn to ride.JG: Oh! That sounds doable. So safety wise, this is something that, ahem, a mom of two young children could feel comfortable doing? Not with my baby on the scooter, obviously...MK: Riding a scoot is about as safe, or safer, than riding a bike in the city. Like I said, they don't go more than 30 mph, so the real risk isn't the scooter -- it's cars and trucks, which is something everyone in the city has to worry about. At least when you're on a scooter you're in the flow of traffic with other vehicles, not over on the side where you're harder to see.JG: I'll bet you're quite the pro scoot rider now. What was your own scooter experience before you came up with the idea for Scoot?MK: I was looking for a scooter, and being an environmentalist, I really wanted an electric one. When I found out how popular and affordable electric scooters had become in other parts of the world, I thought there might be an opportunity to bring them to the U.S.JG: So now that they're in the U.S., tell me: Who's riding the scoots? Young professionals going to work? Environmentalist types? Grandmas out for a joyride?MK: The diversity has been one of the biggest surprises. A lot of people ride just to explore the city and have fun, but the customers who ride the most also use it for work or commuting or errands like going to get groceries. (Note to hipster luddites now embracing a flip phone: One thing all Scoot riders have in common is a smartphone; you can't ride without one, since the phone keeps track of the scoot and is used for cashless payments.)JG: Obviously an electric scooter is more sustainable than a taxi in the city, or certainly Uber, which seems to be all the rage here in LA. Are you using sustainable energy to charge the scoots as well?MK: For now we charge them with normal wall outlets. A solar panel is an obvious symbol of greenness to so many people, but when you switch from a 3,000-pound car to a 200-pound scooter and power it with electricity, the difference that makes in the environment is so massive that doing it with solar or wind power or more than the solar/wind mix that's already in the PG&E energy mix is kind of like dotting an I. A scoot uses about as much power as your toaster while you're riding it. We're literally more energy efficient per passenger mile than a subway.JG: So it's not just, \"Hey, I'm green, I need a solar panel.\" You're looking at what's really important.MK: We want to stick with the real environmental significance, which is getting people on a small, efficient electric vehicle they can afford. That being said, if we feel like we can green it up more with a solar panel at some point in the future and that makes sense, we might do that.JG: What is in the immediate future for Scoot, other than more scoots or locations?MK: We just introduced an electric motorcycle into the fleet, and we'll probably introduce a two-person scooter later this year.JG: Sounds like a great date night! Big picture though, what's your vision for the American city of 2050? The Scoot Networks Twitter bio is \"The future of urban transportation\"; I love that, since I'm trying to see \"the world as it could be\" via this column.MK: We see the American city of 2050 being a lot more dense, and having a lot less space for private cars. Most short trips will be made on foot, with trips over a mile or so being taken on a wide variety of small, speedy, on-demand electric vehicles.JG: Looks like my city has a long way to go, then. Could Scoot work in a car-driven city like LA?MK: Scoot is a great complement to transit, biking, walking and car share. In cities where you have to own a car to go anywhere, adoption of Scoot would be slower, so our initial focus will be on cities that are less car-dominated.JG: Boo hoo. Looks like I'll have to plan that trip to San Fran for real, then.MK: We'd love to give you a more first-hand experience.JG: Sounds like a great follow-up!

Beyond the Spin: Here's Why Energy Efficiency Standards Are Worth Celebrating", "text": "With tighter efficiency standards finally kicking in for 60- and 40-watt lightbulbs this month, the Heritage Foundation's blog recently encouraged Americans to \"stock up on incandescent bulbs\" before the federal government \"takes them away.\"Talk about bad advice.  According to the Heritage Foundation, those old, outmoded incandescent bulbs have \"become a symbol in the fight for consumer freedom and against unnecessary governmental interference into the lives of the American people.\"Really? If that's true, it is particularly sad. Because recent advances in lightbulb technology offer a gigantic win for consumers, businesses, and the planet. What's more, the \"governmental interference\" the Heritage folks carp about has actually added up to one of the biggest across-the-board economic and environmental success stories of the past two decades.Proof in Numbers Let's start with the raw numbers. Ironically, around the same time the Heritage Foundation published its piece, the Energy Department issued its latest figures showing -- remarkably -- that the average amount of electricity consumed in U.S. homes has fallen to levels unseen for a decade.Think for a moment about how many more electronic devices we all use these days even for tasks -- from brushing our teeth to reading books and magazines -- that we used to do without electricity. And yet, nonetheless, we're still seeing steady declines in residential electricity consumption, down now to the 2001 level of an average of 10,819 kilowatt-hours per household. It's a remarkable and indisputable achievement that is saving you money and lowering the nation's carbon emissions. The story is, to a large extent, a direct result of government energy efficiency standards.But first, let's look more closely at those outmoded lightbulbs the Heritage Foundation wants you to buy.Shedding Some Light Beyond any political spin, the truth is that we're on the cusp of a full-blown revolution in lighting technology. Incandescent lightbulbs, virtually unchanged since Thomas Edison's heyday, have always been notoriously inefficient, emitting some 95 percent of their energy input as heat rather than light (which explains why they quickly get so hot to the touch when they are turned on).Fast forward to today's LED bulbs that are quickly becoming the industry standard. If you're one of those who have been skeptical about the quality of light from newfangled bulbs, you owe it to yourself to give the latest generation a try. There are many varieties, but I'm a particular fan of the 60-watt equivalent \"soft white\" lightbulbs manufactured by Cree, Inc. They look just like an old incandescent and give off an almost identical warm light while using just 9.5 watts of electricity.That means you get virtually the same light as from an incandescent bulb while using just 16 percent of the electricity you used before. Wouldn't you rather get the same thing you used to pay a dollar for while spending just 16 cents to get it? Of course, as an added benefit, these lightbulbs result in just 16 percent of the carbon emissions of their predecessors presuming the same fossil-fuel generating source for the electricity -- a dramatic reduction that will be a major boon to global warming once they are widely adopted.What's particularly galling about the Heritage Foundation's advice, though, is that it is wrongheaded even from a purely economic standpoint. Sure, incandescent lightbulbs have long been available for a dollar or two apiece. But the new LED bulbs now sell for as little as $10 each and are designed to last some twenty times longer than an incandescent. That's a good deal even if they used the same amount of electricity. But the real dramatic bargain comes in your monthly electric bill.Taking Charge of Your Electricity at Home Lighting consumes somewhere around 10 to 15 percent of the electricity you use. Technology is rapidly changing the picture but, when I co-wrote the book Cooler Smarter: Practical Steps for Low-Carbon Living in 2012 along with some of my expert colleagues at the Union of Concerned Scientists, government figures showed that the average American home spent roughly $190 annually on electricity for lighting. You would spend roughly that much by burning ten 60-watt incandescent bulbs for 8 hours each day at the national average price of electricity. By changing all ten of those 60-watt bulbs to LED bulbs using just 9.5 watts each, you would cut your annual lighting costs to just over $30. Not only would you save $160 each year, you would also lower your household's carbon emissions by roughly a half a ton.Of course, over the lifetime of an LED bulb -- and multiplied by millions of American households -- we are talking about some serious savings and undeniable progress: getting more for less while helping the environment. What's not to like about that?The Power of Efficiency Standards Which brings us to those government efficiency standards the Heritage Foundation and others love to decry. The numbers show clearly that these efficiency standards for appliances and equipment such as lightbulbs have been one of the federal government's most successful strategies for reducing energy consumption since their inception more than two decades ago.What makes energy efficiency programs so appealing is that they can yield significant reductions quickly and save money for both consumers and businesses. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows in detail how efficiency measures using existing technology could cut total U.S. energy consumption by 29 percent by 2030, if we found the political will to implement them.The key thing to understand is that most manufacturers are fully capable of making their products a lot more energy efficient right now. But changes in their processes might incur modest costs that could put them at a disadvantage to their rivals. That's where government efficiency standards come in. They work because manufacturers know that their competitors must abide by the same rules. Ultimately, everyone benefits.Government lightbulb standards are just one example. The ones kicking in this month actually stem from the 2007 federal energy bill enacted during President George W. Bush's administration that started to phase out the sale of inefficient incandescent bulbs beginning in 2012. (Notably, despite what the Heritage Foundation claims, some more efficient incandescent bulbs will meet the new standards and thus will continue to be sold.)How well have these kinds of efficiency standards worked in getting more for less? The answers are all around us. Some modern 40-inch LED televisions bought today use 80 percent less power than the old cathode ray televisions of the past. The average desktop computer costs you some $28 to run annually while doing the same things on that iPad or other tablet will run up less than $2 in yearly electricity costs.The case of refrigerators is especially instructive. Refrigerators -- one of the biggest electricity guzzlers in most American homes, cost the average household somewhere around $123 per year to operate. What this figure masks, however, is the striking progress made in efficiency. Six rounds of progressively stronger standards helped to push a dramatic change that benefits all. The first three rounds (initiated by California and then picked up by other states) took place from 1978 through 2003, while the later ones were adopted at the federal level. After the 2003 rule took effect, the average new refrigerator was 60 percent cheaper and 20 percent larger than its mid-1970s counterpart and used 70 percent less electricity.Putting aside the hype and misinformation, appliance efficiency standards introduced over the last few decades have helped speed this process along, bringing down energy use per appliance dramatically, reducing total U.S. electricity consumption as of 2010 by an estimated 7 percent below the amount that would have been consumed without those standards in place. Some of the government's programs, such as the current Energy Star program, offer only voluntary guidelines rather than mandatory standards. According to the government, in fact, if every refrigerator, dishwasher, and clothes washer purchased in the United States this year had been required to meet the federal government's current Energy Star efficiency guidelines, we would have saved another $700 million in annual energy costs while preventing 2 million more tons of greenhouse gases each year, equivalent to the annual emissions from some 350,000 cars.Of course, the Energy Star program also shows that we don't need to wait for mandatory government standards to see results. Smart consumer decisions can help you reap even more savings and, for those interested, Cooler Smarter offers a lot more science-based advice to sort these kinds of choices out for yourself. The key is this: the next time you hear whining about government efficiency standards \"taking away\" your rights, consider the evidence. And then go treat yourself to a night or two on the town to celebrate all the money you are saving and the good you're doing for the environment."}, {"title": "Will Illinois Ban Fracking After Disaster Strikes Or Before?", "text": "An Illinois ban on fracking is inevitable. The question is whether it will happen before or after a major fracking disaster.The public comment period on Illinois' draft regulations ended January 3 with groups in potentially impacted areas repeating their call for a ban on fracking. A group of southern Illinois residents representing several grassroots groups drove to Illinois Department of Natural Resources headquarters in Springfield to join with Frack Free Illinois in delivering comments on the regulation and a petition asking Governor Quinn to oversee a rewrite.Tabitha Tripp, of Anna-Jonesboro, said in a statement, \"these inadequate rules will leave nothing but legacies of disasters to those who voted on this irresponsible law and abandon Illinois tax payers who will indeed foot the bill for public health issues like cancer and leukemia.\"The regulation will likely be improved before being presented to the General Assembly's Joint Committee on Administrative Rules for final approval. Even groups who supported the law are objecting to the Department of Natural Resources' flaccid follow up. A few politicians will claim a victory for the environment after DNR makes marginal changes. But, the real weakness in the rules follows from the inadequacy of the law itself.The law does not address the consequences of a tornado hitting a fracking site. It does not resolve the release of chemicals in a major flood, despite the fact that fracking will likely happen in floodplains of a region bordered by two of the highest volume rivers in America. The law provides for monitoring, but not preventing, fracking induced earthquakes despite the fact that it's expected along major fault lines. If a large groundwater source, such as the Mahomet aquifer, is depleted or contaminated it could impact the water supply of hundreds of thousands of people.A long list of other omissions in the law may be less dramatic but will be just as dangerous. For example, there's no provision for monitoring air emissions at fracking sites, which a University of Colorado study linked to chronic health problems for those living nearby. DNR is allowed to waive fines that are already too low, and issue new permits to repeat offenders.When pushing for the law, Governor Quinn claimed it will protect the environment. That was a lie.Some lead movers behind the law are usually environmental allies, such as chief Senate sponsor Mike Frerichs, Green Caucus Chair Ann Williams, and Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie. It's surprising that a blue state with a supposedly environmental Governor and large Democratic majority in the legislature voted to launch a fracking boom. For now, they can justify their action by claiming it's a strong law. It will be more difficult to defend themselves after a serious incident disproves their claim.It's inevitable that one or more disasters will eventually happen with alarming consequences. When it does, Pat Quinn and the other fracking hypocrites in the legislature will face a changed political reality as they scramble to save face by passing a ban.Many Illinois residents want the state to proactively ban fracking instead of waiting to react after disaster strikes. MoveOn.org recently announced a Fracking Fighters small grant program and I was lucky enough to be one of 100 selected. As part of my project, I'm launching a petition to ban fracking in Illinois.Now that a basement level of basic protections are on the books, Illinois has the opportunity to be a a national leader by taking the next step in showing the only way to reliably protect people from the consequences of fracking: ban it."}, {"title": "A Kabbalist's Feast: The Tu B'Shevat Seder", "text": "Years ago in the ancient city of Safed, a group of Kabbalists uncovered the mystical secrets of Tu B'Shevat, the Jewish holiday commemorating trees which begins, this year, on Wednesday night, January 15.This group revealed these mystical secrets in a ritual ceremony patterned after the Passover Seder and observed on the night of Tu B'shevat, the 15th of the month of Shevat, which coincides with the full moon.The Seder features four cups of wine, a ritual text, various fruits, cakes and other delicacies.

The National Institutes of Health releases its research chimps. New York City plans an end to its carriage horses. Shark fins are banned again and again and again. Then there's\"Blackfish.\" And Al Gore. Banksy. Chipotle. Even Burger King.We're resurrecting The Dodo -- which we drove into extinction nearly 400 years ago -- because my co-founder Izzie Lerer and I see signs of a revolutionary shift in our relationship with animals. It's not (just) all those cute cat and puppy videos, either. Animals matter more to us now. No longer domesticated beasts, we let more of them into our homes than ever, and to 90 percent of us they're \"members of the family.\" And it goes way beyond our homes and the fortunes we spend on them, past the halls of academia where animal studies programs are exploding in popularity, through the state, federal and global legislatures that are passing greater welfare and species protection laws, beyond the various demographics who list animal rights as the top issue that motivate them, even beyond the growing number of people changing their diets out of ethical concerns.Many of us have always felt, deep in our bones, that the rational arguments (\"speciesism,\" academics call it) that allowed us to feel superior over our furrier, scalier counterparts were intellectually flimsy, emotionally false. The dog I grew up with, an irascible lab-mix named Boots, had an unflagging loyalty and flinty intelligence; a more recent orange tabby in my life named Lucas had a pure sweetness and compassion that no one would be able to convince me was in the least bit unevolved. And science, thankfully, has increasingly stepped up to prove us right. We know elephants exhibit self-awareness and empathy, orcas and other cetaceans are capable of great mourning, and Emory University's Gregory Berns took brain scans of dogs that suggest the completely startling and yet absolutely unsurprising news that canine brains appear to look and function much the way ours do. Who knows? Soon dogs might be able to tell us all about it.This has fueled the burgeoning \"nonhuman personhood\" movement that's challenging the way we can legally treat animals, providing the argument for a ban on using dolphins or other cetaceans for entertainment in India, and fueling a buzzy case in New York that seeks enhanced rights on behalf of chimps. It's rapidly pushed us way beyond thinking of animals as things we raise for food or press into entertainment. They're intelligent, sentient beings whose cognitive, emotional and social capacities mirror our own. Those creatures big and small that have fed, frightened, entertained, comforted and awed us are no longer just them. Increasingly, they are us.We're talking about a movement with compassion at its core. Sure, there will be cute videos on The Dodo, but we'll focus on images you won't feel conflicted about watching -- as Izzie puts it, we'll celebrate animals, and not just laugh at them. We plan to explore our fierce and fraught bond with animals broadly and enthusiastically, from animal testing to the ethical eating movement. Most people are still figuring out where they stand on a lot of these issues; one of my favorite voices belongs to Bob Comis, a pig farmer in upstate New York, who openly grapples with the ethics of what he does, once writing: \"What I do is wrong, in spite of its acceptance by nearly 95% of the American population.

At A Fish Market", "text": "By David Shiffman: (Click here for original article)After his 1902 trip to Yemen, scholar and naturalist Wilhelm Hein returned with a variety of plants and animals, which he donated to the Vienna Museum. One of these specimens, a shark, sat unnoticed for more than 80 years. In 1985 it was identified as the first (and only known) specimen of Carcharhinus leiodon, the smoothtooth blacktip shark. Because no others had ever been found by scientists, Alec Moore, regional vice chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group\u2019s Indian Ocean group, says that \u201csome suspected it might be extinct or not a valid species.\u201dIn 2008, during a Shark Conservation Society research expedition to Kuwait\u2019s sharq fish market (the name is a coincidence, it means east in Arabic), Moore says that \u201camongst the many species of whaler shark was one which looked very similar, but different, to a couple of other species.\u201d Later analysis revealed that although this specimen was more than 3,000 kilometers from where Hein caught his, this was a smoothtooth blacktip, the first new individual seen by scientists in over a century.>>View a slide show of shark species at fish marketsThese sharks are currently considered \u201cVulnerable\u201d to extinction by on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, an assessment that was made before their rediscovery by Dr. Moore and his team. More recent studies in fish markets throughout the region have located 47 additional smoothtooth blacktip sharks, greatly increasing what scientists know about this species with and reported in a 2013 paper in Marine & Freshwater Research. The new study included some of the first data on how large smoothtooth blacktips can grow, how many pups they can bear and their habitat usage as well as other information needed for an effective conservation and management plan in the future.Shopping for species Fish market surveys of the kind that resulted in the rediscovery of the smoothtooth blacktip are an increasingly common research tool that offers many advantages over traditional scientific field sampling. Julia Spaet, a researcher at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, says that \u201cthe resources dedicated by a fleet of fishermen will always outmatch any scientific efforts to assess abundances. In other words, the fishing industry is more efficient at finding sharks where there are not much left.\u201dThese surveys are hard work. Researchers have to arrive before dawn, before the boats come in to land their catches. The species of interest have to be identified, counted, measured and sampled before they are sold to customers. When further study is required, researchers need to purchase the fishes themselves. This whole process can be, for lack of a technical term, disgusting. Moore says he \u201conce made the mistake of climbing into a skip [waste bin] to sample a load of rays that had been festering in the sun; the response of my gastrointestinal tract to this was, as an understatement, memorably unfavorable.\u201dSurveys also offer challenges not faced by scientists who do field surveys, such as gaining fishermen\u2019s trust. Moore says that \u201calthough sometimes bemused by what we are doing, they are generally very tolerant of weird foreigners poking around, and we've met some incredibly generous, funny and helpful people\u2014we've even been given breakfast.\u201dResearchers have made many discoveries relevant to the conservation of threatened shark and ray species by studying the catches in fish markets in Kuwait, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Rima Jabado, a PhD student at United Arab Emirates University, was contacted by a fisherman who found an unusual looking shark, which resulted in the first scientific record of a sand tiger shark in United Arab Emirates waters. Jabado also found species with local legal protections for sale in markets, such as whale sharks and green sawfish, which she says shows \u201csome species should be protected and managed locally and that there is a clear need for better enforcement of some of the current legislation.\u201d Spaet agrees, noting that \u201cin Saudi Arabia shark fishing is prohibited by law, yet we still find large numbers of sharks landed at the markets every day.\u201dIn the meantime Moore has some advice for any shark-o-philes going on vacation: \u201cAlways go to the fish market with a camera, especially in tropical countries where there is little data\u2014there is always the chance that you could find something new. Even if you don't, fish markets in the early morning are amazing\u2014lively places with real character and great food.\u201dFollow Scientific American on Twitter @SciAm and @SciamBlogs.

This came on the heels of the September announcement that Anglo American -- the 50 percent owner of the Pebble Mine -- was dumping the project. Mitsubishi had already walked away three years ago.The Pebble Mine project is hanging by a thread, and it's time to sever it once and for all. Northern Dynasty Minerals is trying to hold on to its reckless plan but thanks to a campaign led by NRDC and our allies in Alaska, concerned citizens have built a formidable opposition and exposed the Pebble project for what it truly is: a toxic investment.Pebble Mine would carve a massive open pit out of the pristine watershed that feeds the most lucrative wild salmon runs in the world. Every year, tens of millions salmon return to the region, supporting bears, wolves, and whales as well as people. The salmon sustain a $1.5 billion annual commercial fishery that employs 14,000 full- and part-time workers. The salmon also nourish Native communities that have relied on subsistence fishing and hunting for thousands of years.The colossal mine would endanger all of those natural riches. The pit would be two miles wide by 2,000 feet deep, and the project would generate so much waste -- 10 billion tons -- that immense earthen dams, some taller than the Three Gorges Dam in China, would be needed to it back forever. All is a seismically active area.The U.S. EPA issued in draft a scientific review of the potential impacts of large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed and concluded that the risks are \"catastrophic.\" The agency is expected to release its final report shortly.Countless citizens from Alaska and around the country raised the alarm in state agencies, federal offices, and shareholder meetings at Rio Tinto's and Anglo American's London headquarters. The message has been received. Former Anglo American CEO Cynthia Carroll, for instance, said in the past the \"We will not go where communities are against us.\"Now we must deliver the same message to the last company standing: Northern Dynasty Minerals.

The law is set to take effect in August, but three of the world's largest agrochemical companies are now suing to overturn it.Dupont, Syngenta and Agrigentics Inc. filed the lawsuit in federal court, claiming that the Kauai law is unconstitutional.The law requires large agrocultural companies to disclose pesticide use, report genetically engineered crops, and create buffer zones between pesticide-sprayed fields and public areas like schools, hospitals and homes.\"The ordinance is invalid,\" Paul Minehart, a spokesman for Syngenta, said. \"It arbitrarily targets our industry with burdensome and baseless restrictions on farming operations by attempting to regulate activities over which counties in Hawaii have no jurisdiction. These activities are already regulated by governmental agencies under state and federal laws.\"The three companies collectively lease 11,500 acres on the island of Kauai for test farms and research facilities. They grow a mix of biotech seed crops, including corn, soybeans, canola and rice, according to the lawsuit. Kauai's temperate climate gives the companies \"the invaluable opportunity to triple or quadruple the pace of development of GM crops,\" and is \"crucial\" to the companies' success.Kauai residents, who have long resisted biotech and big agricultural companies, put on an incredible show of activism in support of the new law. When Kauai Mayor Bernard P. Carvahlo cited concerns over the bill's legal standing and vetoed it two weeks after its passage, the local community was outraged. The bill eventually passed after county council members voted to override the veto.Now, it seems like Kauai will have to fight an even harder battle against the big-ag companies. Councilman Gary Hooser, who co-introduced the bill, said the companies were trying to bully the residents of Kauai. \"They chose to use their money and legal power to bully us in court,\" Hooser said. \"These companies do not want our county to set a precedent that other communities are going to follow.\"Hooser also warned that the companies are using the lawsuit to maintain a shroud of secrecy around their pesticide use. \"We do not know and cannot properly research and evaluate these impacts because the companies will not tell us what chemicals they are using,\" he said. \"Instead, they choose to ignore the decision of our local community and take us to court.\"Various law firms have offered Kauai County pro-bono services to fight the legal challenges, and environmental lawyers are also providing pro-bono assistance, while not directly representing the county.\"You've got three very big corporations all ganging up to bring this lawsuit,\" said Earthjustice attorney Paul Achitoff. \"If it costs them a little more money to beef up their security, rather than using secrecy, that's what they need to do,\" he said.A scheduling conference for the lawsuit is set for April 14 in the U.S. District Court in Honolulu."}, {"title": "On the Importance of Appreciating Animals", "text": "Cross-posted from TheDodo.com.You can tell a lot about people from their screensavers. Mine is a picture of gazelles: They are my role models. They run and flee when there is a danger -- say, a leopard or a lion approaching -- but as soon as the danger passes, they stop and go back to grazing peacefully without a care in the world. But human beings cannot distinguish between real dangers and imagined ones. As Mark Williams, a clinical psychology professor at Oxford, explains, \"the brain's alarm signals start to be triggered not only by the current scare, but by past threats and future worries... So when we humans bring to mind other threats and losses, as well as the current scenario, our bodies' fight-or-flight systems do not switch off when the danger is past. Unlike the gazelles, we don't stop running.\" This is modern man's predicament, perfectly summed up by Michel de Montaigne: \"There were many terrible things in my life, but most of them never happened.\"I've had gazelles -- and lots of other animals, actually -- on my mind lately, because I just finished putting the final touches on a book about the Third Metric and about what makes life worth living. And in the course of researching and writing it, I arrived at a deeper understanding of all that animals can teach us. That's why I'm delighted at the arrival of The Dodo to lead the conversation on all the ways animals are deserving of our respect and compassion, at a time when the public is more interested than ever before in understanding and empathizing with animals.While my two daughters were still in middle school, they brought into our home a Maltese, who we named Oliver Pistachio Huffington -- Ollie to his friends. Having a pet reinforced one of my core beliefs -- that one purpose of life is to expand the boundaries of our love, to widen the circle of our concern, to open up rather than shut down, expand rather than contract. And every week brings more stories and science about the amazing ways in which pets open our hearts and enhance our lives. Allen McConnell, professor of psychology at Miami University, wrote in Psychology Today that it's well known that our social network is important for our emotional well-being. But that network is not limited to people. According to research from McConnell's lab, pet owners have higher self-esteem, fewer feelings of loneliness, and are more physically fit and socially outgoing.In another study involving 97 pet owners, some in the group were made to feel rejected socially (sounds like high school all over again). Afterwards, some in the study were asked to write about their best friends, while others wrote about their pets. What the researchers found was that thinking about a pet provided the same power to recover from the negative feelings of rejection as thinking about a best friend.Like spouses and close friends, pets can become \"included in the self,\" the core of our being that forms our perspective. McConnell says \"they become as much a part of the self as many family members.\" His conclusion? Pets are often \"friends with benefits\" and our health and happiness improve in meaningful ways from pet ownership.But the benefits of pets go beyond the everyday. \"Pets offer an unconditional love that can be very helpful to people with depression,\" said Ian Cook, psychiatrist and director of UCLA's Depression Research and Clinic Program. For those suffering from depression, pet ownership can be an invaluable source of healing.The role of animals, and especially dogs, as roving ambassadors of goodwill can be seen most clearly in their role as therapy dogs. After the tragic massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012, therapy dogs from all over the country were brought in to help the community, and especially the children of Sandy Hook Elementary School. Six months later Newtown held a \"Day of Thanks\" to show its gratitude. The gathering was attended by 50 dogs (and many more owners and residents). One parent explained that her daughter had had a rough time after the shooting. \"But when she talked about the dogs that she saw every day at school, she lit up.\"Another young girl and a therapy dog developed an especially moving bond. At a Christmas party for Sandy Hook children just after the shooting, 9-year-old Emma Wishneski happened upon a therapy dog named Jeffrey, whose nickname is the \"Positively Peaceful Pit Bull.\" Jeffrey was rescued from a New York City shelter by Milford, Conn., hospice worker Michele Houston. When Emma met Jeffrey, it was love at first sight, and the two were inseparable for the whole party. And since then they've had regular play-dates. \"It was still a really vulnerable time for her, and she just was comfortable sitting next to Jeffrey,\" Emma's mother said. \"He's strong and I think she just feels safe.\" Since then Emma has begun to train her family's dog Jedi (also a rescue dog) as a therapy dog. \"Emma has a smile that could light the world, and I feel like we used to see that smile a lot more, but it's definitely still there,\" her mother said. \"And when she's with Jeffrey she doesn't stop smiling.\"Animals help us be better humans. Quite often, they show us how to be our best selves. Always in the moment, sticking their noses into everything (literally), they see a world that we take for granted, one we're usually just hurriedly passing through on our way to lives we never quite reach.The Dodo would not be launching if not for Izzie Lerer, its co-founder and editor-at-large. Izzie is wrapping up her doctoral studies in philosophy at Columbia, where her research focuses on animal/human relationships. I have known Izzie for almost 10 years and know how passionate and intelligent she is about this most important subject. Her vision is nothing short of wanting to change the world in the way animals are treated. I'm betting on her, and I am sure she will become an important voice in this country on this issue.

There I learned excellence in science and sharpened my systemic skill set.  Like many Australians, I am shocked at what the Coalition has done to the environment and in particular the abysmal performance of the Environment Minister Greg Hunt -- whose word clearly is not his bond as evidenced from this report card.Australia experienced the hottest spring on record and on January 2, 2014 South Australian temperatures were in excess of 120 degrees (F).  Within hours of Tony Abbott becoming prime minister, the Climate Commission was cancelled. This incongruity occurred in the face of Australia's hottest spring ever recorded, the worst NSW drought on record, Super El Nino's predicted to occur at least twice as much in the near future, and the global telltale of an irrefutable warming world -- Western Antarctica loosing billions of metric tons of ice each year so much so that the mantle is being nudged eastward beneath Eastern Antarctica.Bushfires in Australia are burning hotter and moving faster across the landscape than scientists have ever recorded. Furthermore, intense droughts beget more and more deadly wildfires across the nation.  All ecological indicators across Australia vividly show the severity and brutality of global warming i.e. prolonged droughts that beget bushfires and record-breaking floods. Amidst all of this the Coalition who overtly represent carbon-polluting interests are rescinding Labour's Carbon Tax.Droughts are plaguing a warming world and livestock as well as vegetation have no chance of survival without the life blood of Earth -- fresh water.  Concomitantly, the Galilee Basin, the largest coal deposit on the globe, was green-lighted to expand by razing 17,600 acres of the Bimblebox Nature Refuge - a spectacular ecological jewel for a cash infusion of $6 billion and a promise of creating 6,000 jobs. This behemoth mine will rival only the grotesque despoiling of Alberta's exquisite boreal forests for its oil sands, contaminating fresh water and imprinting a colossal carbon footprint thereto killing our biosphere.The unquenchable addiction to petroleum has lead to a massive development in northern Alberta, which extracts gooey bitumen from sand deep within the earth requiring mega amounts of steam energy.The horrendous environmental degradation in western Queensland far from ends in the Galilee Basin. In yesteryears, the Environment Minister at least purportedly took a modicum of pride in protecting the environment. So far this cannot be said of Hunt's portfolio.The Waratah Coal Project is part of the expanding Galilee Basin in western Queensland that will bring Australia's coal export to whopping 240 million metric tons per annum -- a projected increase of five fold under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's new Coalition government.   Seventy-two percent of the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is dying. The oceans are acidifying faster than the previous 300 million years due to escalated carbon pollution of in excess of 85 million metric tons, daily. And as the oceans attempt to digest about 33 million metric tons of carbon dioxide daily the byproduct is greater ocean acidification. Very recently researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences in Townsville added shrimp and crabs to the list of sea urchins, sea stars, sea snails and mussels doomed from rising carbon dioxide. One might assume that an Environment Minister would take all necessary precautions to protect this stunning Australian Reef that is easily comparable in biodiversity to that of the Amazon rainforests especially since it is loaded with potent cancer-fighting medicines. In addition, the Reef provides 50,000 ecotourism jobs and hundreds of millions in revenue for the crown.The Great Barrier Reef is an exquisite hotbed of life chocked with a rich array of biodiversity, which is crucial to the health and well-being of our oceans. Infuriatingly, it is dying quickly  Instead, Hunt has unconscionably hastened the ransacking of the Reef. In order to create six new super coal-tanker ship berths at Port of Abbott Point, 3 million metric tons of dredging has recently been authorized. Rather than alleviating the pending destruction of the Reef from dredging by building jetties to move the boats deeper into waters -- as a government study clearly recommended. (And by the way, dumping dredging is in no way ecologically similar to silt carried by rivers through fabulous filtering estuaries that empty onto the Reef.) Inexplicably, Hunt chose development over protecting his portfolio, the environment.   Harbor dredging creates massive toxic plumes of silt; it also generates pernicious noise pollution, which prevents all forms like Byrd whales or coral clown fish on the Great Barrier Reef from feeding. Currently, both the Queensland and Federal governments have failed to impose any underwater noise regulations upon industry. Moreover, Environment Minister Greg Hunt has failed to protect the Great Barrier Reef from dying quickly.Australia will ramp up its coal production by five fold to a whopping 240 million metric tons per annum eclipsing its nearest coal production rival Indonesia, as it rushes to feed the insatiable demand from both China and India. Tragically, methyl-mercury a byproduct from burning Australian coal in China is now showing up off the shores of California in our blue whales at off the chart levels never witnessed before by my colleagues.   Australians love whales. Whale watching is a lucrative and burgeoning ecotourism industry. When Hunt was in opposition for six years, he claimed that the whales in the Great Southern Ocean would be protected in his environment portfolio.On January 5, 2014 the Japanese ocean-killers murdered 3 minke whales and Sea Shepherd Australia captured their illegal activities on camera as witnessed by the bloodied deck of the Nisshin Maru, stained from their heinous butchering of these magnificent sentient creatures. Photo credit: Tim Watters / Sea Shepherd Australia  Why is the $150 million Oceanic Protector Customs ship stationed at Christmas Island not heading south to ensure that Japan does not slaughter whales within the 200-mile territorial Australian Antarctic zone? In its place, Hunt favored an A-319 aircraft staffed by Customs officials to occasionally fly south and inspect the illegal Japanese poaching fleet from afar.On January 6, 2014 Sea Shepherd Australia's helicopter GPS indicated the northern border of the Antarctic Treaty Zone where the day before the Japanese poachers slaughtered 3 minke whales despite an Australian High Court ruling deeming their whaling illegal. Sea Shephered Australia upheld International Law and chased these loathsome ocean-killers out of the Antarctic Treaty Zone. Photo credit: Eliza Muirhead / Sea Shepherd Australia  The chairman of Sea Shepherd Australia Dr Bob Brown succinctly summed up Hunt's failure to honor his word to protect the whales, \"plane copout.\" Moreover, \"Sea Shepherd Australia is now left alone to do the governments role of enforcing Australian International Law in the Antarctic Region,\" said a purposeful Brown.On January 5, 2014 Sea Shepherd Australia discovered that the Japanese ocean-killers had illegally slaughtered three protected Minke whales and caught the act on film as the bodies were laid on the deck of the Nisshin Maru.  Photo credit: Tim Watters / Sea Shepherd Australia  Our children's legacy is the biosphere. It is being plundered faster and harder in Australia (and around the globe) than ever before.

She is one of the more than 300,000 people who have not been able to use tap water since Thursday, when thousands of pounds of chemicals were reported to have leaked into the water supply.The triplets, all boys, were born two months prematurely. \"We've had to change everything we do -- how we make their formula, how we wash their bottles, how we give them a bath,\" Baumwell told The Huffington Post. \"They're preemies, so they're very susceptible to illness, colds, things like that. So we have to find ways to keep everybody clean, sanitized.\"The family goes through 30 diapers a day, and every changing requires more hand-washing. Every time one of them spits up, a towel at least has to be rinsed. They've set up an elaborate assembly line for cleaning bottles, with multiple buckets of water spread down the kitchen counter.The family already has gone through 15 gallons of bottled water and a case of smaller bottles. When Baumwell's husband went to the Walgreens Thursday night, it was running low on bottled water. Another patron let her husband cut the line to get water, after noticing he was carrying infant formula.Baumwell said she moved to Charleston so her family could help with the triplets. While the water situation is stressful, \"we're lucky they're here,\" she said. \"If we had moved here and not had family, I don't know \u2026 it would have been a lot of trouble.\" She said the family has been traveling to her older sister's home 25 miles away to shower. Her sister has opened her house to family, friends and coworkers who need a place to shower and fill water bottles.State officials have said the chemical leak was discovered Thursday morning, prompting the ban on using tap water for drinking, bathing and other uses. Baumwell said her family didn't get notice until 6 p.m. that evening. \"For all we know, we gave our babies formula all day long, and the chemicals were already in our water,\" she said.\"I'm pretty surprised and frustrated this happened without any sort of safety gap in place. There weren't any inspections done to prevent this from happening, and not a faster response,\" said Baumwell. \"It sounds like to us that the response from the chemical storage company and the water company wasn't very fast, and then getting the information to the people in the city wasn't very fast.\"The advisory on drinking or showering with the tap water was lifted in some parts of the state on Monday afternoon, but not in Baumwell's part of Charleston. \"They keep saying that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, it's coming soon, but there's no actual timeline,\" said Baumwell. \"Days is the best I've heard.\""}, {"title": "Is Lip-licking Beagle a Threat to Baby?", "text": "A veterinarian recently told me an interesting story. A woman who had brought her beagle in for vaccinations mentioned that she was very concerned about the dog's behavior. There was a baby in the family, and it seemed that the beagle would lick his lips whenever he was in close proximity to the infant. The dog also growled when the infant made certain sounds or movements. Did this lip licking, the woman wanted to know, mean that the beagle wanted to eat the baby?The woman's concern is understandable. But the good news is, it's very unlikely that the dog was looking to have the baby for lunch. Lip licking is a common, subtle stress signal in dogs. It's often seen in anxiety-producing situations such as sitting in the vet's waiting room, being in a training class where harsh corrections are used, or even being hugged. (There are some dogs who like or tolerate being hugged, but many don't like it.) In this situation, it's likely that the beagle was simply anxious around the baby. The growling further reinforces the likelihood that the beagle was stressed, since growling is a dog's way of warning us that he's uncomfortable. (See my previous post \"Why Growling is Good.\")Other subtle stress signals to watch for are yawning, scratching, sniffing the ground, scratching, turning away of the head and/or body, or averting the eyes. Of course, any of these signals, including lip licking, can be seen at other times as well; canine body language must be observed as a whole, and in context. It's ironic that understanding these signals is absolutely crucial for dog owners, and yet they're not commonly taught or discussed. In a situation such as the beagle-baby one, had the owner's mind not been put at ease, the dog might have lost his home.While lip licking and other stress signals do not indicate aggression, keep in mind that a scared dog, if pushed too far, can become dangerous. If you see any of these signals in your own dog, try to figure out why he might be nervous. If possible, remove the dog from the situation, and, at another time, work on reducing the dog's stress in those situations. Paying attention to these subtle signals can alert us to the difference between a dog wanting to eat a child and wanting to simply be left alone -- and that's a life-changing difference for everyone involved.Nicole Wilde is a canine behavior specialist and author.

More than two dozen states are examining GMO labeling laws, and state ballot measures in California and Washington have cost the food industry more than $70 million in campaign spending to defeat.\"We should not be making food safety labeling decisions through a patchwork of state laws,\" Louis Finkel, executive vice president of government affairs for the GMA, said in an interview.Finkel said his group has been working with a broad coalition, including biotech crop developers, to put together its legislative and labeling proposals. He would not say which lawmakers the group was working with on the legislation but that it should be introduced soon. The legislation would mandate consistent labeling of non-GMO and GMO foods, while nullifying state laws not identical to the federal law.Another provision would make it mandatory for biotech crop developers to notify the Food and Drug Administration before they introduce a new genetically modified crop to the marketplace - currently that notification is voluntary.\"Making it mandatory gives consumers greater confidence,\" said Finkel.The bill also would set specific time frames in which the FDA has to respond to mandatory notifications.The FDA currently engages in what it calls \"consultations\" with crop developers. The agency then typically issues a letter to those crop developers reminding them that it is a developer's responsibility to ensure its products are safe.The legislation would not change that aspect of oversight but allow the FDA to specify \"any special labeling\" to protect health and safety or to \"prevent the label of bioengineered food from being false or misleading.\"The bill would also allow food manufacturers to label their food products as \"GMO-free\" under certain conditions,Manufacturers would not be allowed to imply that a food is less safe or more safe because of the absence or presence of biotech ingredients.Biotech crops currently on the market include corn, soybeans, canola, and sugar beets that have been genetically altered to repel pests or tolerate direct spraying of herbicides. Those crops are used in a vast array of food products and the companies that develop them say the crops are safe. Many scientific studies back those claims.But there are also studies showing links to human and animal health problems, and environmental damage. Last October, an international coalition of scientists declared there still was no consensus in the global scientific community about the safety of genetically modified crops, which were first commercialized in 1996.The GMA is also pushing the FDA to develop a federal definition of the term \"natural\" on food packaging, and to authorize foods containing biotech ingredients to be labeled as natural.\"Consumers deserve to understand what that word natural means on a package,\" Finkel said.Finkel said he had no criticism of a recent move by General Mills to declare its original Cheerios breakfast cereal to be GMO-free and that it was merely a \"marketplace decision.\"Critics of GMO crops said the proposed legislation was aimed at misleading consumers and covering up concerns about biotech crops.\"Concerned citizens want mandatory labeling of GMOs and don't want natural foods containing GMOs to be labeled as natural,\" said Ronnie Cummins, director of the Organic Consumers Association. \"I doubt seriously that they can get this through.\""}, {"title": "Boston Firefighter Rescues Siberian Husky From Ice-Covered Bay (PHOTOS)", "text": "Firefighters man, they just have a knack for being in the right place at the right time.Sylvie, a 13-year-old Siberian husky, was playing with her owner and accidentally ran across a patch of ice covering Boston's Pleasure Bay last week, falling through.

A microbrew revolution is underway, and breweries worldwide seem to be constantly trying to outdo one another with new flavors and unique brewing techniques. There are beers brewed with everything from exotic grains and spices, to artificially flavored hops, fruits like apricots and pumpkins, moon dust (seriously), even whale meat.  Wait, what? Yes, you read that right: there is now even a beer brewed with whale meat, according to the Independent. And as you might have guessed, this hasn't exactly gone over too well with conservationists and animal rights activists... and probably for good reason. Anti-whaling efforts are at the foundation of the modern environmental movement. The idea of drinking beer flavored with whale meat seems downright archaic-- a cruel throwback to a barbaric era.  The Icelandic beer-maker responsible for the cetacean-flavored brew hasn't helped matters much by using the drink as a special promotional item for an upcoming mid-winter festival in honor of the Norse god Thor. Claims that the beer is a \"healthier\" option due to being high in protein and low in sugar are stirring up controversy. The ad campaign even suggests that those who drink the whale meat concoction will become \"true Vikings.\"  The environmental group Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) has slammed the whaling company behind the beer, Hvalur, by calling the effort a \"desperate hunt\" for new markets for its \"immoral\" meat.  \"Demand for this meat is in decline, with fewer and fewer people eating it,\" said Vanessa Williams-Grey, Icelandic whaling campaign leader. \"Even so, reducing a beautiful, sentient whale to an ingredient on the side of a beer bottle is about as immoral and outrageous as it is possible to get.\"  \"The brewery may claim that this is just a novelty product with a short shelf life, but what price is the life of an endangered whale which might have lived to be 90 years?\"  Dagbjartur Ariliusson, the brewery's owner, has said that the beer will only be sold in Iceland during the midwinter months from January 4th to February 22nd, and that it will not be made for export. He said that the beer is meant to celebrate culture \"as we've done for many centuries and eat cured food, including whale fat, and now we have the beer to drink with this food.\"  The beer has a 5.2 percent alcohol content and is produced when the whale meat is boiled down to extract oil. The remaining byproduct from the whale is to be dried, ground up and sold, likely as animal feed.  Iceland, along with Norway, Japan, the Danish Faeroe Islands, St. Lucia and St. Vincent & The Grenadines are the only nations in the world that still practice whaling in violation of the International Whaling Commission's 1986 ban against commercial whaling."}, {"title": "Americans, Cars, and George Will's Habit of Getting It Wrong", "text": "The F-150 notwithstanding, Americans are choosing more efficient cars.George Will has been described as an \"intellectual,\" as \"erudite,\" \"brilliant,\" even \"brainy.\" If you've ever heard him on television, you'd have to admit that his opinion of his own intellect seems to be quite high. And yet for such an erudite and brainy fellow, it's amazing how often he gets it wrong when it comes to things environmental. (No comment on his other positions.) TheGreenGrok has covered a few of his anti-green gaffes over the years (see here and here, for example) and now we do so yet again.Will's Take on More Efficient Vehicles in AmericaMr. Will's latest \"you got it wrong again\" diatribe appeared in his recent column \"Liberalism By Gesture\" (Washington Post, January 8, 2014). From its title, the piece would seem to have little to do with the environment unless you believe that environmental issues are political in nature -- which I do not and Will apparently does. However, the column quickly turns into a rant against government regulations aimed at improving vehicle fuel economy and thereby lowering pollution, including greenhouse gases emissions.Will claims that such policies are intended to \"wean [American consumers] ... from the desire to drive large, useful, comfortable, safe vehicles ... [and make them] want wee vehicles.\" Citing the fact the Ford F-150 pickup has been the best-selling vehicle for 32 years straight, Will concludes that policies to improve the fuel economy of the American fleet are doomed to failure because they don't recognize the desire of the American consumer and are little more than a liberal gesture and the \"climate may not understand the importance of gestures.\" (I wonder by this, if we may conclude that Will finally accepts the linkage between greenhouse gases and climate.)It's Not Size That CountsThe fact is that policy makers couldn't care less about the size of the vehicles folks drive. The objective is to get drivers to drive vehicles with better fuel economy. Unfortunately, Mr. Will would seem to be stuck in a 20th century time warp unable to recognize that, with technological advances in materials and powertrains, it is possible to greatly enhance a car's efficiency without radically altering its size.And the fact is, the fuel economy of many vehicles being bought in the United States has increased markedly. According to a recent report of the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, the \"average sales-weighted fuel-economy rating (window sticker) of purchased new vehicles\" increased in 2013 for the sixth consecutive year. Since 2007, the average fuel economy increased by almost 20 percent, from 20.8 miles per gallon to 24.7 miles per gallon. And by the way, Mr. Will, this occurred at the same time that many Americans were choosing to buy F-150s.The Ford F-150\u2032s MakeoverAnd while we're on the subject of the F-150, ironies of ironies, right on the heels of Mr. Will's column pointing to F-150 sales as evidence that fuel economy-boosting policies are no more than a \"gesture\" came this New York Times article: \u201cThe F-150's Aluminum Diet.\u201d Ford, it turns out, is redesigning its classic truck \"making one of the boldest product gambles in its 111-year history\" -- \"switching to a body that is largely lightweight aluminum ... to improve fuel economy.\" (See CNN video here.) Ford estimates that with this redesign, the pickup will achieve close to 30 miles per gallon. As you can see from the above graphic, that would place the F-150 well above the average of new vehicles sold in 2013. I'd call that a victory for the policies Mr. Will is so quick to deride.Mr. Will might choose to keep his head buried in the sand, but it appears that a major transformation is occurring in Americans' automobile-buying habits. Not necessarily a shift to smaller cars, but, rather, with technological innovation, a shift to those that take us more miles on less fuel -- no matter what the fuel. And, as it turns out, the change we're witnessing is not just about the cars we buy and drive, it's also about our driving behavior -- specifically, less of it.

After decades of research, screening, new treatments and public education, the death rate from cancer is decreasing (by 20 percent over the last 20 years) and the chances of getting cancer are lower in men and stabilizing in women. The American Cancer Society is celebrating this accomplishment and estimates that 1.3 million more lives have been saved over two decades because of the decreasing rate of cancer deaths.Why is this? Risk of having cancer is less because of cancer prevention. Smoking cessation is more effective due to better support or smokers, improved medications, and better advice from primary physicians (but even now 19 percent still smoke). Knowledge of what is a healthy diet is more widespread. Exposure to chemicals in the environment is less due to regulations. HPV vaccination is increasing. But obesity remains high, with 63 percent of Americans overweight.Since cancer screening is more available, cancers are being diagnosed at more limited stages (stage 0 or stage I), which are more curable. This includes mammography, PSA screening for prostate cancer, colonoscopy and stool blood test screening for cancer and polyps, PAP smears and HPV testing, skin examinations, and CT scans for smokers to detect curable lung cancers.Because of research, cancer treatments are more effective with newer robotic surgery, better radiation therapy with IMRT and proton beam, and combinations of hormonal, biotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy which increase cure rates.But the estimates for 2014 are still frightening. In this Year of Health (my phrase), 1.66 million people in the United States will have cancer diagnosed and 585,000 will die. With health care reform, many patients may find it more challenging or expensive to go to their physicians, possibly decreasing access to prevention and screening, even though prevention is now paid for.So what should you do now? Here are my five tips to stay cancer-free or get cured:\u2022 See your doctor for a screening examination. Be sure to undress so your physician can examine all of your skin area for early cancers.\u2022 Discuss screening tests with your doctor, including mammography, PSA testing, PAP smear, colonoscopy, stool blood check, and low dose CT scan of the chest if you have been a smoker.\u2022 Have your doctor review your family history carefully to help determine your risk of certain cancers. You can calculate your own risk of breast cancer by using the breast cancer risk tool from the National Cancer Institute. Then ask your doctor how she/he is going to prevent the cancers you might be more likely to develop. Be certain to discuss tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, finasteride, statins and aspirin for breast, prostate and colon cancer prevention. Enlist your doctor's support and get a program to stop smoking. If your doctor is unaware of how to do prevention, get a second opinion (see the chapter on second opinions in my book Surviving American Medicine for my 10 Commandments of Second Opinions).\u2022 Diet is important to review with your doctor to get the best diet for preventing cancer (less red meat, five helpings a day of fruits or vegetables, and a helping of nuts daily). Establish an exercise program to reduce breast and colon cancer and to maintain a normal weight, which reduces your risk of cancer. Avoid toxic chemicals at work or in your house.\u2022 Emphasize healthy lifestyles, cancer prevention and cancer screening with your family. Get HPV vaccination and hepatitis B vaccination for you and/or your family at the appropriate ages.Still the most feared of all diseases, cancer now has some good news. But the responsibility is yours to make sure you are one of the good statistics, not one of the bad ones."}, {"title": "How 'Polar Vortex' Became The Scariest Word Of 2014 So Far (VIDEO)", "text": "Remember last week when we all endured the terror that was the Polar Vortex?

For a little guy, the sights and sounds of those first job sites were cool: piles of lumber, ladders up the roof, the scream of circular saws making cuts. But one thing stood out among them all: the smell of sawdust from those cuts. To a carpenter, it takes on the smell of ambrosia. Anytime you smell it, it means you've got work. It means things are good.Strangely, across my decade of summers on job sites, not once did I consider a single tract of forest that produced that lumber. I simply lived in a world that never asked that question. As it is with most natural resources that are rendered into the economy, the end user does not contemplate these things. Our economy has persisted with open-ended accounting, despite being inside a biosphere that represents the ultimate closed-loop. As populations have moved further away from the land, the feedback loops of action-consequence have been removed.Last year, in a bid to live closer to the land, our family moved just north of Portland, Oregon, on a homestead in the tiny Rock Creek drainage. Not three months after we got there, we were awakened in the pre-dawn hours by chainsaws felling 100-foot Douglas firs that crashed down across the slopes facing our property.It shook our windows and it shook our kids.The girls, aged 11 and nine, took it especially tough. They felt they were watching Dr. Seuss's Truffula Trees coming down. From the end of our driveway, waiting for the morning school bus, they watched and cried silently. They looked up at their dad, head of a conservation group, wondering how he could stop it for them. The cut was legal and done on private land -- nothing could be done.It was tough, but it exposed to me a fault line that runs all the way back to one of the biggest catalysts for environmental action in the modern era: the motivated NIMBY (acronym for Not in My Back Yard). The intent is good, but it too, fails to close the loop. NIMBYs often stop the perceived injury nearby, but they continue to use the products -- the act merely happens elsewhere. Though the action is unseen by the NIMBY, the consequence still largely occurs. Were the Kennedys prepared to decrease Hyannis Port energy use when they opposed the offshore windmills? The economy continues as normal.In that moment at the top of our hill with my girls, I realized that their seeing this was a hard thing, but a blessing nonetheless. For them, it closed with great force the accounting loop for a resource we use all the time. From the garden boxes which we'd planted in the spring to the very bus shelter in which they stood, we used those products. Those trees were cut because of us (and you, dear reader). And in the end, it's important to understand that our decisions have consequences that should be considered before, during and after the action is taken.Silently, that 22-acre clear-cut across the way serves as reminder to live a considered life inside a responsible economy. Those trees will grow back. What will also grow in my kids is the understanding that a responsible economy means environmental debits and credits are properly considered and tracked -- known by all who consume. As humans began to bump up against the limits of the planet, we will be well-served that every action has a consequence, and that in the end, it all happens in our collective back yard. And that's okay... as long as we manage it intentionally."}, {"title": "Seal Island, Maine Animal Camera Helping Scientists Understand Gray Seals And Other Species (VIDEO)", "text": "Live streaming video by UstreamGray seals are giving birth to their young right now at an island located 19 miles off the coast of Maine -- and one wildlife camera is capturing the phenomenon.

Data from the Center for American Progress found that the move to solar is largely a middle-class phenomenon.But solar's disruption of the utilities business model has not been entirely welcomed.

I don't think dogs should bite people, but sometimes they're left no other option.Dogs are constantly blamed, but that isn't always fair. There are some situations where it's the person who has pushed the dog beyond its limit.As a mom of two elementary age kids, I get the concept of feeling pressed to the wall, but unlike a dog, I have words at my disposal and teach my kids to voice their feelings as well. Dogs don't have words, although they routinely feel a similar sense of confusion, fear and frustration. While dogs do communicate, they use postures in place of words. To hear a dog, a person must listen with their eyes. Until the public learns how to do this, however, many people still unknowingly over-step their boundaries and get bitten.So what happens when a dog bites? The dog in question (and other dogs by association) is reduced to a reactive public menace and is legally forced into isolation or worse -- euthanasia. The public's take home message is, \"Dogs who bite are dangerous.\" Case closed.  This verdict, however, lets humanity off the hook. My hope in 2014 is to encourage people to take some responsibility for being bitten, and trim this dog-bites-human statistic by a few percentage points. How? Through education, of course.I've written a series of articles to explain why dogs bite and what you can do to avoid frustrating or scaring a dog to the point of reacting. Here is my top ten list on how you can avoid a dog bite in 2014. I will elaborate on each of the following steps in the coming weeks.1. Don't stare. Staring is rude! We all learned that in kindergarten, but few teachers taught us that it applies to all species. No matter how many legs you walk on, staring is rude, unpleasant and confrontational. 2. Don't take it personally.. All dogs do not love all people. Don't take it personally. If you hold out your hand and the dog doesn't step forward, move on. If a dog scares you, step back. Immediately. 3. Recognize each dog breed's personality.. Certain dog breeds love to meet and greet new people and dogs, others not so much. Recognizing breed difference is helpful.  4. Identify a dog's personal space. You don't like it when people crowd you, especially when you're busy, pre-occupied or resting. Give dogs the same respect. 5. Let the dog approach you. Dogs are nearsighted and recognize new people by smell, not sight. Let dogs be the first to approach, and let him sniff you over. 6.  Listen with your eyes.  Dogs use posture and facial expressions to convey emotions. Here you'll learn how to tune into a dog's perspective. 7. Let your body talk. Dogs do not understand words. Simple postures speak louder than words. 8. Never assume a dog is friendly. Always ask permission before approaching a dog. If you're a parent, understand and respect your kid's perspective. You're responsible for both the dog and the child. 9. Doll it out. Dogs, like kids, love treats. Keep a pocket full of goodies if you hope to make a new friend. 10. Move in slow motion.  Dogs -- like people -- are a little suspicious of anyone moving too quickly. If you find yourself around an unfamiliar dog, take it slow.   As a trainer who's seen just about everything -- from dogs being insufferably restrained and poked to shocked and shouted at -- I'm amazed that dogs don't bite people more often.  As dogs have the same emotional range as young kids, compare a dog's tolerance to that of a typical five year old. If I treated my son the way many people treat their beloved dogs -- with unpredictable seclusion, leash dragging and random play interruption -- he'd use words (loud, loud words!) to voice his confusion. And if he didn't have words to express that confusion, he'd be bearing his teeth and throwing punches for sure.Of course, there are fun and positive ways to encourage cooperation and to condition dogs to comply with our civilized habits, but I will thread those into a later article. For now I'll simply tell you how to avoid getting bitten by a dog. We'll start with step one.   Step One- Don't Stare As kids, we learn that staring is rude, though few of us emerge unscathed by a social stare down or two. Now apply this to dogs who are equally unsettled and suspicious of social stare downs. I leave you with two considerations:1. Avoid Staring at Dogs: Do not stare at an unknown dog, whether you're fearful or enthusiastic to meet them. Looking is fine, but any direct eye contact over 3 seconds may trip a dog's tolerance level and prompt a hyper or defensive reaction. Where should you look when petting a dog? I set my sights above the dog's head or to the person holding the leash.2. Steer clear of a dog who stares at you: Being stared at is unnerving no matter how many legs you walk on. A dog who stares is contemplating your next move. Be wary and keep your distance. If you stare back or approach cheerfully the dog will rise up to engage you. If you're forced to stand in the presence of a dog who is watching you, turn sideways, relax your shoulders and look down.   Stay tuned for steps two and three in the coming days. In the meantime, please comment with your thoughts, stories and questions and give your dog a pat, two extra biscuits and a belly rub from me."}, {"title": "13-Year Old's Claymation Project Sheds Light On The Tragic Life Of A Pig (VIDEO)", "text": "Typically, claymation is used to tell some not-so-serious stories.

Over 300,000 people in Charleston, the state's capital, and nine of its neighboring counties were told that their tap water could not be used. According to New York Times reporter Trip Gabriel:Officials said that up to 5,000 gallons of an industrial chemical used in coal processing seeped from a ruptured storage tank into the Elk River, just upstream of the intake pipes for the regional water company. Authorities struggled to determine how much danger the little-known chemical, MCHM, or 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, posed...The owner of the ruptured tank, Freedom Industries, processes and stores chemicals used in the coal industry in 14 tanks on the Elk River, 2.5 miles upstream from the junction of the Kanawha River in downtown Charleston.Later reports indicated that close to 7,500 gallons had leaked and as I write these words, the water emergency is in its fourth day. While a high percentage of West Virginians deny the validity of climate science as they desperately try to defend their all-important coal industry, the danger posed by this coal-processing chemical is too obvious to ignore. The chemical smells like licorice and is making people sick. You don't need to be a scientist to know that something is wrong. Normally, chemical storage tanks do not rupture and toxics don't get into the water system. But to err is human. And humans manage the production system that permitted the chemical tanks to rupture and took too long to stop. A well-thought-through production process would not have placed the chemical company's facility upstream from Charleston's water supply intake pipe. A better regulatory system would inspect both chemical storage and production facilities, but West Virginia doesn't have such a system; you know, \"if you're gonna make an omelet you gotta break some eggs.\"The overall quality of America's freshwater sources continues to improve, but as the country continues to grow and urbanize, dangers such as those seen in West Virginia remain. According to Patrik Jonsson of the Christian Science Monitor, America's:Rivers and streams are becoming cleaner thanks to industry advances and government regulation. But this week's chemical spill in West Virginia shows that threats to the environment and public water supplies remain... Coming after the deadly explosion at a chemical storage facility in Texas last year and three years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the leak of an estimated 5,000 gallons of a toxic coal-processing chemical into West Virginia's Elk River has quickly become a reminder of how deeply involved Americans are with heavy industry in their midst.When assessing the relative risks posed by technology, it is critical to analyze the degree to which humans and critical environmental resources are in the pathway of exposure to potential hazards caused by toxic technology. A nuclear power plant like Indian Point, located just north of New York City, poses a greater risk to more people than a plant located near a smaller city. There are 20 million people living within a 50-mile radius of Indian Point. One of New York City's reservoirs is 15 miles from the plant. It is easy to argue that even if an accident at the plant is very unlikely, its impact could be massive. Still, projecting risk is not simple. The probability of events that must be assessed can vary widely, as can the intensity and irreversibility of an event's impact.There is no way to make the world free of risk, and most of us would find a risk-free world incredibly boring. The task is not to eliminate risk, but to reduce its probability and intensity. That requires an attitude of prudent and careful economic development, management, regulation and enforcement. In America, we have the problem that many people consider government to be some sort of disease and see economic development and wealth as ends rather than means. To some, government regulation \"kills jobs\" and nothing is as important as the creation of economic wealth. Still, the absence of effective management at the ironically named Freedom Industries and the pathetic regulation of chemical storage facilities in West Virginia has led to mass economic loss for over 300,000 people. The reality of the issue seems to be interfering with the ideology that some people have been conditioned to apply when thinking about environmental issues.Water, air and food are necessities, not luxuries. Air and water are collective, common resources that cannot be distributed through the \"free market.\" Air and water quality must be protected by the government. There is no alternative to government policy, regulation and enforcement. The freedom to pursue economic gain cannot be allowed to threaten the drinking water of 300,000 people. I find it amazing that I am reduced to making this fundamental argument over four decades after Congress overrode Richard Nixon's veto and enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act back in 1972. Yet West Virginia itself is the epicenter of the latest anti-government surge. EPA's modest move to start regulating greenhouse gases is seen by locals as unwarranted government interference in the coal industry. The attempt to limit automatic weapons and require identity checks on gun purchasers is considered the first phase of an effort to deny hunters the right to bear arms. Why is anyone surprised that in this environment, Freedom Industries is permitted to store toxic chemicals in decrepit, corroding tanks?The production, storage and use of toxic chemicals are unevenly regulated in the United States. Some state and local governments require that companies report on certain chemicals used in production, while some states have even moved to ban a few chemicals. Federal law requires companies to report the presence of toxic chemicals on their property, and according to the Wall Street Journal, Freedom Industries reported the presence of its toxic chemicals to the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. However, according to Jim Malewitz of Governing Magazine:The burden to investigate many chemicals that could endanger human health has fallen to states, which have enacted a patchwork of regulations that environmentalists, policymakers and industry leaders all consider inadequate... Advocates of change now hope the increased awareness in state legislatures will translate into a sense of urgency in Congress, as it considers the latest attempt to overhaul the 35-year-old and never-updated Toxic Chemicals Safety Act... Much has changed in chemical manufacturing since 1976, when Congress passed the Toxic Chemicals Safety Act, and science continues to add volumes of new information about chemical hazards every year.The fundamental issue is that the needs of economic development and the pace of technological change far exceed our political system's ability to provide adequate governance. We operate under the delusional assumption that all chemicals used in production are safe. To regulate chemicals, the government must prove that they are dangerous. In my view, the burden of proof is upside down. Industry should first be required to prove the substance is safe, or at least demonstrate that the benefits of the chemical to society-not to the company-are greater than the costs. It is finally time to apply the precautionary principle to chemicals used in production. Drug companies must prove that new drugs are safe and effective. Why not apply this practice to the use of new technologies? The alternative is more water crises like the one in West Virginia, along with similar air and water crises. Do we really want to wait until millions of people are poisoned and the environmental contamination lasts for months instead of days?"}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: Detouring From The McNugget Route", "text": "You're fried from work, your child is cranky, you're both starved and looking at imminent meal meltdown. You take the path of least resistance, and go for quick and kid-pleasing or what author and blogger Matthew Amster-Burton calls \"the McNugget route.\"\"We assume the worst about kids,\" says Susan Levin of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. \"We say, my kid won't eat anything but chicken fingers, French fries and pizza. We aren't giving them a chance to taste healthy foods.\"Amster-Burton doesn't demand his daughter eat anything, healthful or otherwise, but he exposes her to new and varied foods, foods from every culture. \"As a parent, it's my responsibility to make sure Iris gets food. Any amount of it that goes down her is up to her,\" says the author of \"Hungry Monkey: A Food-Loving Father's Quest to Raise an Adventurous Eater.\"Iris Amster-Burton, now 6, has eaten chili enchiladas, mushroom frittatas and pad thai. She helps make blueberry buckwheat pancakes and homemade pretzels. Her favorite dishes, she explains, are fried rice, gyoza (Japanese dumplings), pizza, ice cream and cake. Her father is not interested in raising a vegetarian, he is raising his daughter to have an informed palate.\"Hungry Monkey\" shows how giving your child a whole range of foods offers opportunities for great eats and for what the parenting blogs call bonding. Amster-Burton is a big proponent of the shared family meal. \"The whole family eating the same dinner, that makes me happy as a cook and as an eater,\" he says. Caving and going the McNugget route may keep the peace at dinnertime, but there's a difference, Amster-Burton notes, between a peaceful meal and a pleasurable one.Sometimes the path of least resistance turns out to take you where you don't want to go. Going the McNugget route also means you're helping to keep the industrial food system -- the same system behind the recent egg and beef recalls -- run smoother than ever. Industrial food is about churning out maximum product at minimal cost. It's good business. It is not, however, good -- or safe -- food policy.Salmonella and its toxic bro E. coli existed before industrial food. But now, with food both centralized and mass-produced, by the time we determine the source of contamination, whoops, it's too late, it's national, it's everywhere. It can be fatal for us and it's never good for the animals. The chickens that go into those McNuggets are raised in ways that might make your child cry. It might make you cry, too. This is not the most ethical food out there. Nor is it the only food.  You have parent creds, use 'em. \"It's up to you to give your child the best possible options,\" says Levin.Amster-Burton prefers doing that in the most hedonistic way, by taking Iris on food safaris as close as their local farmers market and as far-flung as Japan -- that's where she developed her gyoza weakness and her growing interest in spicy food. Amster-Burton's new book \"Pretty Good Number One: An American Family Eats Tokyo\" shows being a (groan) responsible parent can be a good time, too. Not every food will be a winner. Iris is, at the moment, anti-carrot and anti-egg salad. That still leaves a world of flavors and foods to discover without going the McNugget route.\"We eat more vegetables now than before Iris was born,\" says Amster-Burton. \"She's helped me reacquaint with food as an adventure.\"Vegetable DonburiThis post originally appeared on Sept. 20, 2010."}, {"title": "Global Warming 'Pause' Isn't What Climate Change Skeptics Say It Is - Weather.com", "text": "\"Global warming is continuing, it just gets manifested in different ways,\" says Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research who co-authored the study with NCAR's Dr. John Fasullo.Read more on www.weather.com"}, {"title": "2014 Is Our Climate Moment", "text": "Few leaders can say that the decisions taken in 2014 will play a big part in determining whether their country will still grace the world map at the end of this century. I can. Lying at an average of just two metres above sea level, my tiny atoll nation stands at the precipice, threatened existentially by the gathering storm called climate change.The year just passed must surely have settled whatever debate, if any, still remained on the science of climate change. The world's biggest and most expert group of climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, found that it is now \"unequivocal\" that human activity is warming our planet, and that many of the environmental changes we are currently experiencing are unprecedented for millennia. As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said to an audience in my country late last year, \"the science is clear, it is irrefutable, and it is alarming.\"In the Marshall Islands, 2013 was a particularly difficult year. In May, our northern atolls suffered through an unprecedented drought, which forced my Government to declare a State of Disaster. Just six weeks later, our capital, Majuro, was hit by a king tide and rising seas that flooded the airport runway and many nearby homes, including my own. Then in November, we gasped and prayed as the devastating Typhoon Haiyan smashed into our neighbours in Palau and the Philippines, killing 6,000 people and destroying close to one million homes. Nearly 2,000 people are still unaccounted for.While the Pacific is perhaps the region most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, this story is fast becoming a global one. In October, Cyclone Phailin battered India's eastern coastline and, during the Christmas just passed, the United Kingdom was brought to a standstill by fierce winds, driving rains and power blackouts. Just a little more than a year after Superstorm Sandy, scientists are already predicting 17 Atlantic hurricanes for 2014 -- this would be 15 more than last year, and the highest number since records began. Climate disasters are fast becoming the new norm right around the world.Despite all these warnings and the knowledge that we have the economic means and technologies to accelerate the necessary shift to clean and green development, the fight against climate change is unfortunately suffering from a misplaced hope that we still have plenty of time to act, or that the proverbial silver bullet is just around the corner. In reality, time is already up.In 2014, world leaders must finally rise to this challenge. Focusing exclusively on talks to conclude a new global climate agreement in 2015 in Paris is not a risk we can afford to take, not least because that agreement is not due to come into effect until 2020. As scientists have told us, global emissions must peak THIS decade if we are to have a realistic chance of avoiding the worst of climate change's impacts. It is time for us all to live up to our own lofty rhetoric, and actually do what is necessary to slow and eventually reverse the pollution of our atmosphere, in turn curbing global warming and the rising seas that threaten to engulf my homeland.Last September, the leaders of the Pacific decided to do just that. Gathered in Majuro for the 44th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' meeting, we adopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, committing ourselves to be \"Climate Leaders\", and listed a set of commitments to urgently phase down greenhouse gas emissions and embrace the switch to renewable energy. It is the kind of leadership that has the tiny countries of Niue, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu striving to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020, and my own Government to fully solarise the power for each and every one of our outer atoll island communities.While these examples of Pacific leadership help to set the right tone, they of course will not be enough to bend the trajectory of global emissions set by the world's high-emitting countries and companies. For this reason, the Majuro Declaration challenged all governments, businesses and organisations to join our call for climate leadership, and register their own commitments to new and more ambitious climate action. While we are pleased with the support the Declaration has received so far from beyond the membership of the Pacific Islands Forum -- including the listing of commitments by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the U.S. State of Hawaii -- we are now looking to others to follow their lead.With the urgency of the climate crisis intensifying with each passing day, the UN Secretary-General's invitation to world leaders to attend a climate change summit in New York this September could not have come soon enough. Learning from the Copenhagen experience, the Secretary-General sees his 2014 summit as a stage to announce new collaborations and initiatives to accelerate action now, and not simply as a podium for countries to \"commit to commit\" ahead of Paris.As Ban Ki-moon said himself in Warsaw in November, the summit must \"propel us forward through concrete action\" towards 2015. This is why 2014 must not merely be a \"Year of Climate Action\", as Mr Ban has labelled it, but rather a \"Year of New Climate Action.\" In other words, we need to commit to do more now than we have committed to previously, including a new wave of climate action that sees us peaking global emissions before 2020.It is in this spirit that we welcome positive signals from China as it prepares for new emissions standards and working carbon markets under its next Five Year Plan, and ongoing efforts by President Obama to implement his Climate Action Plan, including the phasing out of coal power stations in the United States. In contrast, Japan's decision to renege on its 25 per cent emission reduction target and the recent carbon price policy reversals in Australia are unhelpful blips on the otherwise steady course towards the low-carbon world economy. Everyone needs to play their part, especially those with the biggest carbon footprint, and those who count among their closest friends the vulnerable countries that will bear the brunt of their polluting ways.For our part, we look forward to September's Summit with a renewed sense of hope, and a strong resolve to use 2014's ministerial meetings and diplomatic opportunities to develop new ideas and forge new partnerships that make a real dent in emissions now. One critical area of focus must be the energy sector, which is currently responsible for some two-thirds of global emissions.While renewable energy is already the fastest growing source of power and expected to increase by 40 per cent in the next five years, we need to quickly accelerate the transition to clean, green and more efficient energy systems. Having recently achieved a record 59 per cent peaking in the renewables contribution to the power grid in Europe's biggest economy, Germany has shown us that it can be done. And the quicker it is done, the better and cheaper it will be. As the International Energy Agency has told us, for every one dollar not invested now in new clean energy, it will cost us more than $4 after 2020 to compensate for the missed opportunity to reduce emissions this decade.While understanding the need and accepting the logic to act now, we continue to emit and emit. There are signs of progress, and yet humanity has the world barrelling towards 4 degrees or more of dangerous global warming. Our window to secure a climate future capable of sustaining my country's culture, its dignity and its territory is closing quickly.Leaders must come to New York in September with their sights set high, and with bold new announcements that get us back on a pathway to a safe climate future. The European Union could play a catalytic role by recording internationally that it will easily overachieve on its current target to reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2020, and that this will enable deeper and more ambitious EU cuts under a new global agreement. Others would surely follow suit.It is increasingly clear to political leaders of all persuasions that if they are prepared to set out a bold vision for ambitious climate action, their constituencies will stand with them, including big business, and they are all prepared to do the necessary work. The release of updated and more alarming scientific data from the IPCC later this year should reinforce the political resolve to act. If the science and summits of 2014 don't finally turn the tide, it is difficult to see what will. This is the battle of our generation, and 2014 is our moment.Christopher J.

The chemical is used to wash coal after it is mined from the ground.The disclosure was included in paperwork that Freedom Industries had filed under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, a 1986 law that is meant ensure that the public and first responders are adequately informed in the case of an accident, and that there is a plan to deal with it, such as alerts and evacuations.The paper reports that state emergency response officials had a copy of the form, and so did the emergency planners and responders in Kanawha County.

Well for some colonies of emperor penguins, it appears the only solution is to move away from that melting sea ice \u2013 even if it means climbing up the very steep sides of floating ice shelves to find safer breeding sites.The new behavior \u2013 described this week in the journal PLoS One \u2013 was observed in four of the 46 known emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica. These birds normally \"tend to breed on the sea ice because it gives them relatively easy access to waters where they hunt for food,\" lead research Peter Fretwell of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said in a press release. But with sea ice at reduced levels around Antarctica lately, Fretwell and his fellow researchers observed four groups of penguins which did not follow this normal behavior.  According to Fretwell, the sea ice in some locations in 2011 and 2012 was not strong enough to support the normal breeding colonies. \"The sea ice did not form until a month after the breeding season began,\" he said. \"During those years the birds moved up onto the neighboring floating ice shelf to raise their young.\" Two colonies moved during both years, while the remaining two each only moved one year.  It wasn't an easy journey. Fretwell called it \"a very difficult maneuver\" which required the penguins to climb 30 meters (nearly 100 feet). Considering that emperor penguins are rather ungainly \u2014 or, as Fretwell puts it, \"clumsy\" \u2014 on land, that's quite a feat.  While the news that the penguins had to abandon their normal breeding sites is disturbing, the researchers do point out a silver lining: the fact that they moved means they \"may be capable of adapting their behavior\" to fit a newly warming world.  Co-author Barbara Wienecke of the Australian Antarctic Division said that \"these new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals, however, we cannot assume that this behavior is widespread in other penguin populations. The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment \u2014 from sea ice to ice shelf \u2014 in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.\"  The behavior was observed via satellite and probably would not have been noticed without that eye in the sky. Another co-author, Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution, said \"it is likely that there are other nuances of the emperor penguin environment that will be detected sooner through their behavior than by more conventional means of measuring environmental changes.\""}, {"title": "Could GMO Apples Taint The Fruit's Good Reputation?", "text": "When the inside of an apple is exposed to oxygen, it begins to brown quickly, making it unappealing to many apple eaters, especially children.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "U.S. Soldiers in Somalia and the Pentagon's Unlearned Lessons", "text": "News that the Pentagon is sending its military back into Somalia, after 20 years, shows that America is still missing the point on the Horn of Africa when it comes to preventing violence.

If Western actors -- whether in the U.S., the EU, or elsewhere -- care about the future stability of Somalia, they had better change their approach and fast.This country hangs in a very delicate balance. While Mogadishu is bustling with business like any normal city, and nothing like the bomb-riddled war zone the world prefers to present in the press, if the international community does not change its approach, we will soon see a resurgence of instability.First and foremost, America's counter-terrorism approach to Somalia must be rethought completely. Government officials here know that al-Shabaab recruits heavily from the poor and unemployed sectors of Somali society and from clans who are marginalized from the political process. They know that the way to undermine al-Shabaab's power and presence is through economic development and job creation, political participation and inclusion, and by building the security infrastructure necessary for Somali self-governance. They know that the way to ensure that former fighters do not return to al-Shabaab is through an aggressive rehabilitation and reintegration strategy on par with what Saudi Arabia is doing with its former fighters. And yet, what most of America's Defense and State departments are doing here is antithetical to this goal.The U.S. and international community's preferred approach is to pump billions into security assistance and next to nothing on economic development and job creation in Somalia. This is not an exaggeration. There is next to no money for transportation, power and energy grids, hospitals and schools -- all the stuff this necessary for a stable society.Witness this in Baghdad, Kabul, Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province and now in Mogadishu. Additionally, there is little to no effort to support and train a national Somali security sector. Instead, paramilitaries and private security companies like U.S.-based Bancroft are pervasive and the African Union Mission in Somalia continues to get fully funded (with no exit strategy) and with clear economic self-interest in the continuation of violence, paying its soldiers 15 times what Somali soldiers get paid.Second, the difficulty of doing business in Somalia must be addressed. In meeting with the Chamber of Commerce in Mogadishu it became clear that one of the main obstacles to economic development is the lack of a financial system, internationally accredited banks and legal mechanisms for ensuring accountability.The U.N. Somalia Monitoring Group, a Western-led oversight group that is categorically dismissed by Somali government and nongovernment leaders for doing much to undermine progress and potential in Somalia, is now singlehandedly dismantling Somalia's sole financial effort: their Central Bank. One wonders if the current chair of the Monitoring Group, a former World Bank official based in Nairobi, is following in the footsteps of his Bank predecessors and working to undermine financial self-sufficiency that would make Somalia less dependent on international financial institutions. This has happened before by the Bank -- throughout the developing world -- so the suspicion has merit.Third, the West's penchant for resource exploitation on the African continent has no place on the Horn. Take, for example, the oil and gas exploration deal signed recently between Britain's newly formed Soma Oil and Gas Exploration, chaired by U.K. conservative leader Lord Michael Howard, and the Somali's Minister of Natural Resources, with whom I also met to discuss the country's national environmental policy (the draft of which seemed very forward-looking and progressive).Skeptics in Mogadishu wondered what Britain's recent interest was all about and now it's clear. Estimates of Somali offshore oil stand at 110 billion barrels. In a seemingly asymmetrical negotiated process, the spoils -- Somalia gets 12 percent of royalties, minimum of 50 percent of profits, rents for leasing and a $200,000 community development fund -- may have some financial face value for Somalia but the real test is in the capacity and infrastructure built in the country.Oil and cash will come and go but what is Soma leaving behind other than unlimited exploration? Very little in capacity and infrastructure it turns out. To Soma's credit, they'll at least be hiring Somalis for basic, low-level service jobs, a practice that is not followed by the myriad international defense and development contractors operating in the mini-\"green zone\" adjacent to Mogadishu's airport, nor followed by the African Union Mission in Somalia. What a lost opportunity to employ and train Somalis and build out a skilled labor sector.What is needed, as one Somali businessman put it, is a \"godfather\" -- a country that looks out for the best interests of the Somali people. Currently, Somalis feel there is none, but rather a set of self-interested countries near and far that have a financial stake in a perpetually dis-unified Somalia: from regional meddlers like Kenya and Ethiopia to international \"lions,\" to quote a member of Parliament, like America and the U.K. Every one of them -- said one government minister -- has their interest.For America and the U.K., it's either counter-terrorism or oil (American oil companies also bought up blocks decades ago). But in both cases, it is clear that the Somali people are not the beneficiaries.This self-interest by companies and countries is fickle and dangerous and unless economic development is prioritized, instability and insecurity will return. There are plenty of opportunities to pursue, whether it's growing Somali's livestock industry, which currently exports 5 million goats and sheep to the Gulf, reviving Somalia's nascent banana and mango industries, creating a lucrative solar-power energy market, or developing a sustainable fishing industry, there are jobs to be created and Somalis to be trained and hired.If the world cares at all about the stability and security of a country that has seen more war than most nations, this is the only path to pursue and the most humanitarian one as well.

But for a few days this past week, with its record-breaking deep freeze* over large swaths of the Midwest, Northeast and even parts of the South, the \"polar vortex\" was a main topic of conversation around town and topped many a headline and newscast. A Google search on \"polar vortex\" brought me 17 million hits. It was quite an event.Now, as the polar vortex weakens and moves on toward Europe -- and those of us who experienced the system thankfully look forward to balmier weather this weekend, if we are so lucky -- let's pause to look back on just how much the vortex torqued temperatures over our part of the globe.Some Got It Cold, Some Got It HotThe graphic below shows the global distribution of temperature anomalies (the temperature excursion from the average for that day and location) on January 7. Note the dark blue and purple colors blanketing the eastern half of the United States -- it was cold.But there's another feature of this figure that has perhaps not been stressed enough. Note the green, yellow, and even red colors over Alaska, eastern Canada, and northern Europe. While many of us Americans were in a deep freeze, our neighbors to the north as well as in Europe were, at least figuratively, baking in the oven.It's the Weather, StupidThe weather this past week wasn't just about cold temperatures; it was about cold temperatures in one place and warm ones in another.Despite what some, like the Donald, Rush Limbaugh, and others have been saying, the event we experienced last week wasn't a sign of global cooling. It was indicative of heat being redistributed. And that's not unusual; it's what the atmosphere does.Much of the weather we experience -- the rain and the cold, and the hot and the dry -- is generated by the atmosphere acting as a heat engine, moving heat from the tropics to the polar regions. The polar vortex is simply an example of the atmosphere working very hard and fast at that redistribution thing. The good news, at least so far, is that this type of polar vortex excursion is not the norm. Some speculate that global warming will make them more common (see here, here and here, for example). Let's hope they're wrong.___________________End Note* Low temperature records were broken in various places (e.g., New York City, Maine, Chicago) from January 5 through January 7 but there were no all-time record lows.Further ReadingPolar Vortex Enters Northern U.S. NASA, January 6, 2014What's going on with the Polar Vortex?

You know that salt is bad for you, so here are some green alternatives to melt your winter ice.Organic, Salt-free De-icer:It's a little pricier than salt, but these products will help to keep your walkways and driveways ice-free.Kitty Litter:Okay, this doesn't actually melt the ice, but it does provide traction for a more non-slip surface.Urea:This is a natural de-icer, and while it won't harm your pets, corrode your metal or pit your concrete, it can be really bad news for your plants, so avoid using it near the garden.Alfalfa Meal:This is a super effective, natural, green ice melting alternative. It's 100 percent natural, and is usually used as a fertilizer. It's grainy so it will provide traction and is extremely effective when used in moderation.Sugar Beet Juice:The juice from sugar beets lowers the melting point of ice and snow, which helps to clear your driveway. It's even been used to melt ice and snow on municipal roads in some areas. It's safe for animals, people, metals, concrete and plants. Beet juice is one of the only options which are effective below negative 20 degrees Celsius.Sand or coffee grinds:Sprinkle sand over your icy surfaces to provide traction, and the darker colors absorb more heat and help to melt snow and ice.Don't underestimate the importance of shoveling.

The key task of this COP was essentially to pave the way for the negotiations next year at COP-20 in Lima, Peru, as a lead-up to the real target, reaching a new international climate agreement at the 2015 negotiations in Paris to be implemented in 2020, when the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol comes to an end. If that was the key objective, then the Warsaw meetings must be judged to be at least a modest success \u2014 the baton was not dropped, rather it was passed successfully in this long relay race of negotiations.Before going further, I would like to acknowledge something else about COP-19 in Warsaw, namely the excellent logistics. Anyone who suffered through the disastrous logistical arrangements for COP-15 in Copenhagen will not take this for granted. Perhaps ironically, in the years I've been participating in these annual events, the two best organized conferences (in terms of logistical arrangements) were the two Polish COPs - COP-14 in Poznan in 2008 and COP-19 in Warsaw this year.As I have written in many previous essays at this blog, the challenges standing in the way of an effective international climate change agreement are numerous and severe. A brief historical account is necessary to explain the significance of what transpired in Warsaw. However, if you're familiar with international climate policy, particularly the history of these international negotiations, I suggest you skip the next section and move directly to \"Issue #1: Making Progress toward a Post-Kyoto Agreement.\"Some Historical Background to Place the Warsaw Talks in Context: the UNFCCC, the Berlin Mandate, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Durban PlatformThe U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (the first \"Earth Summit\") in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, contains what was to become a crucial passage: \"The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.\" [emphasis added] The countries considered to be \"developed country Parties\" were listed in an appendix to the 1992 Convention \u00ad\u2014 Annex I.The phrase \u2014 common but differentiated responsibilities \u2014 was given a specific interpretation three years after the Earth Summit by the first decision adopted by the first Conference of the Parties (COP-1) of the U.N. Framework Convention, in Berlin, Germany, April 7, 1995 \u2014 the all important Berlin Mandate, which interpreted the principle as: (1) launching a process to commit (by 1997) the Annex I countries to quantified greenhouse gas emissions reductions within specified time periods (targets and timetables); and (2) stating unambiguously that the process should \"not introduce any new commitments for Parties not included in Annex I.\"Thus, the Berlin Mandate established the dichotomous distinction whereby the Annex I countries were to take on emissions-reductions responsibilities, and the non\u2013Annex I countries were to have no such responsibilities whatsoever. This had wide-ranging and profound consequences, because it became the anchor that prevented real progress in international climate negotiations. With 50 non\u2013Annex I countries coming to have greater per capita income than the poorest of the Annex I countries, the distinction was out of whack within a few years.But, more important than that, this dichotomous distinction meant that: (a) half of global emissions would be from nations without constraints; (b) the world's largest emitter \u2014 China \u2014 would be unconstrained; (c) aggregate compliance costs would be driven up to be four times their cost-effective level, because many opportunities for low-cost emissions abatement in emerging economies were taken off the table; and (d) an institutional structure was perpetuated that made change and progress virtually impossible.The dichotomous Annex I/non\u2013Annex I distinction remained a central \u2014 indeed, the central \u2014 feature of international climate negotiations from COP-1 in Berlin in 1995 continuously until COP-15 in 2009, when hints of possible change first appeared. The Copenhagen Accord (2009) and the Cancun Agreements (2010) began a process of blurring the Annex I/non\u2013Annex I distinction. But this blurring was only in the context of the interim pledge-and-review system established at COP-15 in Copenhagen and certified at COP-16 in Cancun, not in the context of an eventual successor to the Kyoto Protocol. Thus, the Berlin Mandate retained its centrality.Then, in December, 2011, at COP-17 in Durban, South Africa, the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action was adopted. Under some interpretations, it essentially eliminates the Annex I/non\u2013Annex I (or industrialized/developing country) distinction. In the Durban Platform, the delegates decided to reach an agreement by 2015 that will be applicable to all countries by 2020.Rather than adopting the Annex I/non\u2013Annex I (or industrialized/developing country) distinction, the Durban Platform focuses instead on the pledge to create a system of greenhouse gas reductions including all Parties (what matters, really, is all key countries) by 2015 that will come into force by 2020. Nowhere in the text of the decision were phrases such as \"Annex I,\" \"common but differentiated responsibilities,\" \"distributional equity,\" \"historical responsibility,\" all of which had long since become code words for targets for the richest countries and blank checks for all others.By replacing the Berlin Mandate, the Durban Platform opened an important window. National delegations from around the world took on the challenging task to identify a new international climate policy architecture that is consistent with the process, pathway, and principles laid out in the Durban Platform, namely to find a way to include all (key) countries (such as the 20 largest national and regional economies that together account for upwards of 80% of global carbon dioxide emissions) in a structure that brings about meaningful emissions reductions within an appropriate timetable at acceptable cost, while remaining within the overall framework provided by the UNFCCC, including the celebrated principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.Issue #1: Making Progress toward a Post-Kyoto AgreementIn Warsaw, the negotiators were tasked under the Durban Platform track (the so-called \"ADP\" track) to develop a work plan of substantive topics and a related calendar that will lead to the development of the text of an agreement of a new comprehensive policy architecture that can be discussed at COP-20 in Lima one year from now and then subject to final consideration and adoption a year after that at COP-21 in Paris. This they did, and in the process they identified six components for the new architecture: mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity-building, and transparency of action and support. Some of these are more necessary than others, but it was this package that generated agreement in Warsaw.The actual agreement in Warsaw could only be achieved through carefully negotiated text. The delegates' obligation is to eventually adopt \"a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties...\" In truth, the phrase \"under the Convention\" is not necessary, because any decision by the UNFCCC is under the Convention, and therefore it is the case that any agreement produced under the Durban Platform is still subject to the UNFCCC principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities.\" But the large emerging economies tend to view the phrase \"under the Convention\" as supporting the dichotomous distinction of, on the one hand, commitments for Annex I (industrialized) countries to reduce emissions, and, on the other hand, no obligations for non\u2013Annex I (developing) countries, who would take actions only voluntarily and only with financial assistance from the Annex I countries. The same set of large emerging economies insisted that if they were to be included in the agreement, then the word \"commitments\" must be replaced by \"contributions.\"It is looking increasingly likely that the 2015 agreement will take the form of a hybrid architecture, combining: (1) a bottom-up system of national commitments (sorry, national contributions) that arise from \u2014 or are at least consistent with \u2014 national policies and goals; plus (2) top-down, centralized management of oversight, guidance, and coordination, with an eye to increasing ambition over time. At the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements, we outlined such a hybrid international climate policy architecture four years ago (\"A Portfolio of Domestic Commitments: Implementing Common but Differentiated Responsibilities\"), and we explored it further just last month in a new report (\"Identifying Options for a New International Climate Regime Arising from the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action\"). In Warsaw, we co-hosted and participated in two sessions that explored these ideas in considerable detail (you can learn more about that here; we will soon place all of the slide decks from those sessions at the Harvard Project web site).Issue #2: Loss and DamageAs I predicted at the conclusion of last year's climate negotiations (COP-18) in Doha, Qatar, the issue that held the greatest potential for blowing up this year's talks in Warsaw was the topic of \"loss and damage,\" which the delegates agreed to put on the agenda for discussion this year at COP-19. The phrase \"loss and damage\" is typically understood to refer to the range of damages and loss associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Discussions about potential international policy in this realm frequently bring up thoughts about who should pay for such loss and damages, presumably those most responsible for climate change.Since climate change is a function not of current emissions, but of concentrations, responsibility for damages is presumably correlated with cumulative emissions. Hence, the industrialized countries, in particular, the United States, worry that negotiations on \"loss and damage\" would soon raise the specter of unlimited legal liability.The link is less direct than one might think, however. First, there is the global commons nature of the problem, meaning that climate change cannot be linked to emissions from a specific country. Second, there is the highly stochastic link from climate change to changes in weather patterns, so that no specific weather incident \u2014 whether Superstorm Sandy in New York, Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, or Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines \u2014 can be deterministically linked with global climate change. These two scientific realities mean that moving from \"loss and damage\" to legal liability would be a long and perilous road.But this is a very important issue in the climate negotiations for many developing countries, in particular, for the small island states that are most at risk. Hence, it should not be surprising that this area of discussion \u2014 in some ways only a sideshow of the primary talks on reducing emissions and the risk of climate change \u2014 almost caused the talks to collapse.In the end, the delegates agreed to finesse the topic by creating the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, which does not mention liability or promise compensation, but rather states that this is a topic to be discussed further at future meetings, and under the general topic of adaptation to climate change.Issue #3: FinanceThose are two \u2014 the Durban Platform, and Loss and Damage \u2014 of three major issues that were considered in Warsaw. The third was \"finance,\" that is, the question of when and how the industrialized countries will meet the commitment they made at COP-15 in Copenhagen in 2009 to begin delivering $100 billion per year of financial assistance to developing countries in 2020 to help with mitigation and adaptation. Not surprisingly, there was little or no progress on that front. More about this in a future essay. For now ....The Path Ahead \u2014 Any Reason for Optimism?Given my description above of the debates and \"resolution\" regarding the major issues, is there any cause for optimism regarding the path ahead. Regular readers of this blog will know that I tend to see the half-full glass (or one-tenth full glass) of water, and in this case I think there really is cause for cautious optimism regarding the path ahead.This is based upon a singular reality \u2014 the growing convergence of interests between the two most important countries in the world when it comes to climate change and international policy to address it, namely, China and the United States.First of all, the annual carbon dioxide (CO) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of these two countries have already converged. Whereas U.S. CO emissions in 1990 were almost twice the level of Chinese emissions, by 2006 China had overtaken the United States. We are the world's two largest emitters.Second, as I explained above, cumulative emissions are particularly important, because they are what cause climate change. Any discussion of distributional equity in the climate realm inevitably turns to considerations of historic responsibility. Looking at the period 1850\u20132010, the United States led the pack, accounting for nearly 19% of cumulative global emissions of GHGs, with the European Union in second place with 17%, and China third, accounting for about 12% of global cumulative emissions. But that is changing rapidly, because of the fact that emissions are flat to declining throughout the industrialized world, but increasingly rapidly in the large emerging economies, in particular, China. Depending upon the relative rates of economic growth of China and the United States, as well as many other factors, China may top all countries in cumulative emissions within 10 to 20 years from now.Third, China and the United States both have historically high reliance on coal for generating electricity. At a time at which U.S. dependence on coal is decreasing (due to increased supplies of unconventional natural gas and hence lower gas prices ), China continues to rely on coal, but is very concerned about this, partly because of localized health impacts of particulates and other pollutants. Importantly, both countries have very large shale gas reserves. U.S. output (and use for electricity generation) has been increasing rapidly, bringing down CO emissions, whereas Chinese exploitation and output has been constrained by available infrastructure (i.e., lack of pipelines, but that will change).Fourth, in both countries, sub-national climate policies \u2014 cap-and-trade systems \u2014 are moving forward. In the case of the China, seven pilot CO cap-and-trade regimes at the local level are under development, while in the United States, California's ambitious AB-32 cap-and-trade system continues to make progress.Fifth and finally, there is the reality of global geopolitics. If the twentieth century was the American Century, then many observers, including leaders in China, anticipate (or hope) that the twenty-first century will be the Chinese Century. And, as I was quoted by David Jolly in the New York Times as saying, \"If it's your century, you don't obstruct, you lead.\"ConclusionThere was no fundamental setback in Warsaw to the stream of work that needs to be accomplished in Lima in 2014 in preparation for an agreement to be reached in Paris in 2015 under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. This, combined with the reality of increasing convergence of Chinese and U.S. perspectives and interests, leaves me cautiously optimistic (or perhaps, just hopeful) about the path ahead._______________________________________________________________________________________You can view and listen to an assessment of the Warsaw negotiations in a discussion in which I participated on the PBS NewsHour on November 27th, moderated by Judy Woodruff.For other summaries and analyses of Warsaw's COP-19 climate conference, I recommend:Carraro, Carlo. \"COP19: Between Weak Commitments and Tiny Successes.\"  International Center for Climate Governance.

Still, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers is projecting growth of up to 10 percent for China's new car market next year, down from last year's 14 percent market growth.China is currently pushing to limit the use of coal for energy production in a similar fashion -- slowing, but not limiting, the growth of the fuel as an energy resource. As Reuters reports, the country is planning to cut the share of coal it relies on in its mix of energy resources; however, due to a growing demand for energy in the country, coal use will continue to rise in China.The effects of pollution have brought health concerns to the country.

That's an important -- and prudent -- step forward on fighting climate change.The proposed rules would essentially make it impossible to build new coal-burning power plants unless they are fitted with systems to capture and store their carbon emissions. Utilities could, however, build new plants that burn cleaner, lower emitting fuels like natural gas. EPA will receive public comments on the rules until March 10 and has been directed by President Obama to finalize them \"in a timely fashion.\"An even bigger step for the EPA and for the effort to slow climate change will come in June, when the agency plans to issue a new proposed rule to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants. Activities in many states are already showing that significant reductions in the power sector's carbon pollution can be achieved through reasonable, flexible policies.In recommendations provided last month to EPA on the existing power plant rule, top energy and environmental officials from 15 states explained what can be done to reduce greenhouse gases. These efforts have slashed carbon pollution from the power sectors in these states by an average of 20 percent over the past seven years. Many individual states have achieved even greater reductions. Examples of these effective state policies include renewable energy requirements in Minnesota, energy efficiency programs in Colorado, and the Northeast's emissions trading program known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.The states urge EPA to set federal standards that take a comprehensive approach to improving the power system as a whole, rather than regulating carbon pollution at each individual power plant. They also encourage EPA to develop equitable and measurable standards that hold states accountable for making progress on cutting emissions. Officials from Midwestern and mountain states joined those from the West Coast and the Northeast in these comments.In addition to the states, leading power companies are also taking effective steps to reduce carbon pollution. A new report by the Georgetown Climate Center shares their success stories, documenting progress being made across the country.The report presents 21 case studies from seven states and fourteen utilities where carbon pollution was reduced in the power sector. These success stories provide proven examples of what works that the EPA can build upon as it develops carbon regulations for power plants.The report includes examples of carbon pollution reduction strategies from state governments in Minnesota, Colorado, Kentucky, Illinois, Maryland, California, and New York and from 14 power companies that collectively provide electricity or operate power plants in 46 states.Climate change is a major threat to the American economy and the health of the entire planet. The single biggest contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change are electricity-generating power plants. We need that electricity to light our homes and power our factories, of course. But as the states and some power companies are already demonstrating, we can produce that electricity in ways that significantly reduce carbon pollution. Now it's up to the EPA to turn some of those lessons into new regulations that can put the country on a cleaner, more sustainable path."}, {"title": "Forbes Blogger Resigns Over SeaWorld Dispute", "text": "Last week, journalist James McWilliams posted a brief, stinging, eloquent blog at Forbes.com about how the low-budget film \"Blackfish\" is taking on a multi-billion dollar company, and may be winning.

After all, the point of it was simply to show how a low-budget documentary with a compelling thesis could put a well-documented message in the public sphere and, in so doing, deliver a social media lashing to a Goliath of an institution.Q) Clearly, your immediate editor approved the piece. What happened?Clearly? At Forbes.com contributors post articles on their own.Whatever editing happens at Forbes.com does so after the piece goes live, again, at least in my experience. I'm speculating a bit here, (but) what happens is editors scan headlines of posted pieces to see if there are any red flags and, if a hot piece begins to generate a lot of traffic, or motivate complaints, they hone in and take a more careful look at it. A conversation with my immediate editor after my resignation ended on a positive note: we saw each other's perspective but cordially agreed to disagree.Q) What changes did Forbes.com want you to make?I was asked to make changes reflecting conventional journalistic practice. This, in addition to the fact that the requests were not applied consistently, does not necessarily make those changes right. Why, for example, should I lend a SeaWorld representative space to spout some boilerplate propaganda about orcas being happy in captivity? I'm sorry, but that's not the kind of writing I want to do. I don't write as an \"objective\" journalist, at least not in the sense of seriously entertaining the possibility that it might be fine for orcas to be held in captivity. I come at my work with a clearly defined, pro-animal perspective. In this case, the problem came down to (this): what's reasonable for conventional journalism is a status quo that turns too many journalists into bullhorns for the power elite. My experience at Forbes.com led me to realize that much of the conventional media demands that writers assume this impotent role. I find that sad.Q) Many people think you gave up a full-time job. True?  If you ever need a reminder that you shouldn't trust everything you read get yourself into the news. Indeed, a trite sort of hero narrative developed around me, particularly around the idea that I fell on a financial sword for my principles. It's a good story, and I did stick to my principles, but none of it is as dramatic or economically consequential as it appears. Forbes.com paid me a nominal fee to write for them. If anything, I can now make more money writing for publications that pay better than Forbes. I (also) have a day job: I'm a university professor. My advocacy for animals isn't about money. It's about doing what's right.Q) Is there any connection between Forbes and The Blackstone Group?That's easy to find out with a Google search. What I can offer is that the editor with whom I corresponded with at Forbes.com assured me there was no communication between Blackstone and Forbes about my story.   Q) What are your personal views on orca captivity?SeaWorld has held between 60-70 whales in captivity. Ten of them, and maybe more, have caused harm or death to a human. In the wild, orcas do not harm humans. In all of recorded history there has been one orca attack on a human in the wild (non-fatal), and it was most likely an accident (surfer in a wet suit). So, I think that orcas should never be held in captivity. It's always bad for orcas, often bad for trainers, and a cash cow for executives who will say anything to keep the veil over the truth.Q) How can journalism advance this debate?You can't quote an animal for the animal's perspective, but you can, and are often forced to, quote the perspective of the human who profits from that animal's exploitation. I thus think it's critical that writers covering issues involving animal rights cultivate audiences through non-conventional media outlets. If anything, my extensive experience in the mainstream media has, with some exceptions, driven home a depressing message: the rules of conventional journalism are rigged to allow powerful interests to quash the animal perspective.Q) What's next for you?One of my favorite songwriters, Bill Callahan, has this great line: \"You've got to bust up a sidewalk sometimes to get people to gather around.\" So, in the spirit of that message, I'll keep writing for the sake of the sentient creatures that deserve to be heard a lot more than the people who keep them in tanks and ask them to do flips for cash."}, {"title": "5 Ways to Stop Climate Chaos Now", "text": "Let's face it: Climate change, global warming, whatever you call it--but one thing it is for sure is climate chaos--seems so overwhelming that most of us simply shut down emotionally and mentally when we see another headline that says the world is ending sooner rather than later. Even I shut down occasionally! OK, more than occasionally. But every once in a while I wake up out of my comfortable stupor with a flash of insight.The following list came to me during one of these flashes. Here are five actions that I believe, if we all were to focus on, would have transformative effects for our global economy AND personal lives.I've conveniently provided you with both a larger social action approach and something you can do right now in your own personal life and personal space. Either way, you can take action. You don't have to shut down anymore!1. Invest in public transportation AND buy a hybrid. I actually got the idea for this blog at a gas station in New Jersey. In New Jersey, you are not allowed to pump your own gas. So I was parked at a pump and had told the guy to fill it up then I looked back over my shoulder after a few minutes and saw $60! SIXTY dollars? My Prius had never in its life cost $60 to fill. At most it might cost $30 (but usually $25). Of course I immediately thought I'd missed a major price increase in gas. But no, it turned out that the car in front of me had cost $60 to fill, and the gas wasn't pumping to my car yet. WHEW. Then I thought to myself, why would ANYONE not have a hybrid car at this point? I did the quick math: Over the eight years I've owned my Prius, I've probably saved around $14,000 in gas. More importantly, I didn't use $14,000 of gas. Hybrid cars aren't that much more expensive than regular cars at this point, and let's face it, most people are buying large cars that are more expensive than hybrids--usually for some personal style statement. As for public transportation, the incredible success of the Citibike program in New York City shows there is a hunger and ready market for more options. If we all pool our political power to vote for more public transportation like trains, bikes, walking trails, and such, we will create more jobs and make it healthier and easier for people of all political parties to get around.2. Convert to organic agriculture as quickly as possible AND plant an organic garden. There is compost-loads of evidence that organic is better for the environment and your health (again, regardless of your political beliefs), and now there is even more evidence for farmers that big organic corn production can beat big chemical corn production. The thing is, it's about understanding that the microbial life in the soil is what's essential to growing things. Chemicals kill that life. Microbial life is the secret magic power in compost. So if you start a compost pile, you are keeping waste out of the waste stream and creating fertilizer for your garden. The self-sufficiency of planting your own garden and harvesting and preserving your own food (meanwhile cleansing the environment and creating health for you and your family) is a powerful political, social, and personal statement. It really does make a difference. And most interestingly, scientific researchers are finding that the same microbes that make the soil healthy also make our stomachs and immune systems healthier. So people, it's time to embrace germs and microbes and enlist them in our efforts to make both our health and the environment more resilient.3. Invest in renewable energy AND put up solar panels or a windmill. If only we could harness the hot air expended in arguing whether we should or shouldn't do things! Meanwhile, other countries just go ahead and do them, creating more energy independence and a cleaner world. What's not to love about independence? There is no political reason to resist the transition to renewable energy, unless you happen to be employed by a non-renewable-energy (coal, oil, gas) company. The world is certainly heavily dependent on these resources for countless aspects of everyday living, but reducing our reliance on them is in everyone's best interest! Admittedly, it's overwhelming to figure out how to personally incorporate solar and wind into our own homes, but it's not impossible. I cover about 30 percent of my electricity use at home and 50 percent of my hot water (which also heats my home) with solar, and it's easy! It's the gift that keeps on giving.4. Paper and glass, not plastic. One of the biggest mistakes of the past 50 years of the environmental movement was the concept of \"saving a tree\" to justify switching to plastic. In my darker moments, I think maybe it was the idea of some plastics industry executive to gain market share. Now, I love trees. I love them intensely. I have planted hundreds of trees and protect even more than that. But one of the things I love about trees is their flawless and perfect design. They are beautiful AND useful AND renewable. Consider the paper grocery bag. Yes, it takes trees to make one. But the trees grow back, and when the bag is done it literally melts into the earth, feeding the soil from whence it came. Same thing with glass. Glass is made from sand and ultimately returns to sand, while taking a lovely detour into the land of multicolored beach glass that people love to collect and save. I love my cloth grocery bags even more than paper ones, because they last longer and you don't have to kill a tree to make them. But by this point, a bajillion plastic grocery bags have polluted places all around the world and contributed to the giant plastic floating islands in the middle of all the oceans. Those plastics will not melt elegantly into the soil or the sea. They just take up space and degrade into toxic bits and pieces--since they originated from toxic bits and pieces of oil in the first place. And while there is virtually no industry that doesn't pollute the environment in some way, the question is which ones pollute less throughout their products' life cycles and also have the least health impact. Given a choice, always choose paper or glass. It's not just about the energy used to make the products, or even their usefulness at their most useful. It's about looking at the whole life cycle, where a thing comes from and where it ends up, and what it does to us in the meantime.5. Fall in love with nature AND fall in love with yourself. I'm not sure who said it, but I heard someone say recently that we protect what we love. It follows that if we fall in love with nature, we'll be more likely to protect it. What has always and often reassured me about the human species is that a love of nature knows no class, no political party, and no gender or religion. People everywhere can learn to love nature. Whether you are hunting in it, gardening in it, watching birds, or going fishing in it, the act of getting to know and love nature is the greatest gift we can give to ourselves and to the future.I've always said, nature will be just fine without us; it's really us we have to save. And in order to save ourselves, maybe we need to fall in love with ourselves, too. There is something very socially acceptable about self-loathing. It takes more courage to cultivate love than it does to create fear. It takes more self-confidence to fall in love with yourself, your families, and your friends than it does to retreat into bitter cynicism. But ultimately, that, I believe, is where this climate chaos fight will be won or lost: If we desire to protect ourselves because we love ourselves and each other, and we love nature, then all the other things are easy. So very easy.For more from Maria Rodale, visit www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com"}, {"title": "Some 'Frozen Niagara Falls' Photos Really Are Too Good To Be True", "text": "As temperatures around the U.S. dipped into the \"it's ridiculously cold\" zone, stunning wintery photographs began popping up around the Internet.

Earlier this week, financial giant Goldman Sachs sold off its stake in the parent company of SSA Marine, the developer of the dirty and dangerous coal export terminal at Cherry Point.  This is the latest in a series of setbacks for the proposal, which aims to export 50 million tons of Western coal to Asia every year. If built, it would be the largest coal export terminal in North America. Cherry Point is one of six coal export terminals proposed in recent years, and three of those have already been abandoned after years of robust local opposition.The decision by Goldman Sachs to walk away from the Cherry Point coal export terminal is one more strike against this polluting, climate-disrupting, highly controversial project. From Montana where the coal would be mined, all the way to Cherry Point, community members have opposed this project every step of the way.  Our groundswell of public opposition has shown that no one wants dirty coal exports in their community. From polluting communities with toxic coal dust to threatening our climate, thousands of Northwest residents have made it clear that coal exports pose too much harm for our communities.   While another investor (a businessman from Mexico named Fernando Chico Pardo) bought Goldman Sach's stake, this decision is one more big dark cloud on the coal industry's economic horizon. Goldman Sachs signaled their concern with coal investments in a report last July entitled \"The window for thermal coal investment is closing.\" The report forecasts long-term economic headwinds for the coal industry and stated that \"the potential for profit\u00adable investments in new thermal coal mining capacity is becoming increasingly limited.\"This move by Goldman Sachs underscores the continued market uncertainty and doubt regarding coal, but of course grassroots activists in the affected communities are still up against a lot of money. Peabody and SSA can cycle through investors all they want, but communities across the Northwest will continue fight them every step of the way.   I'm inspired by the thousands of people - tribal members, parents, doctors, nurses, business owners, faith leaders, teachers, public officials, and more - who have spoken out against coal exports at all the recent hearings in Washington. More than 13,000 people attended public hearings over the past two years to express overwhelming opposition to these projects.  This news comes on the heels of another victory by Northwest residents who are holding companies accountable for their pollution. On January 2, a judge ruled against BNSF Railway Company and said that a lawsuit over water pollution from their train cars can go forward.  In the summer of 2013, the Sierra Club, Puget Soundkeeper, Columbia Riverkeeper, Spokane Riverkeeper, RE Sources for Sustainable Communities, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Friends of the Columbia Gorge filed the lawsuit against BNSF after finding substantial amounts of coal in and along several Washington waterways near BNSF rail lines. A similar case is also pending before the Western District of Washington in Seattle.  Across the U.S., people from all backgrounds are demanding accountability from polluters and calling for clean energy instead of dirty fuels.  Goldman Sachs sees what so many business owners, doctors, environmental advocates, and local elected leaders are saying: coal exports are a bad bet for the Northwest."}, {"title": "What's the Matter With Idaho?", "text": "Idaho's hateful treatment of wolves has reached disturbing new lows in recent weeks.Late last month the sadly misnamed \"Idaho for Wildlife\" held a two-day \"predator derby\" out of Salmon, Idaho, offering prizes for the most coyotes and wolves killed and the biggest wolf taken.Fortunately, no wolves were killed. But roughly 21 coyotes were gunned down in the event which was pitched as a family friendly opportunity to teach kids about responsible hunting.How killing as many animals as you can, none for food, qualifies as responsible hunting defies reason -- but not Idaho law.Also last month the Idaho Department of Fish and Game -- with approval from the U.S. Forest Service -- hired a bounty hunter to trek into the largest wilderness in the lower 48 states, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, and kill two entire wolf packs.Idaho's Department of Fish and Game says the extermination of these two packs in a wilderness area is needed to increase elk numbers for hunters, yet acknowledges that elk numbers in Idaho are at an all-time high. Although elk numbers have declined some in recent years in the Frank Church, they remain healthy and are expected to increase with recent habitat created by fires.Killing of these wolves thus isn't just heartless -- it's also a boondoggle. It has nothing to do with science-based wildlife management and everything to do with the anti-wolf attitudes of some hunters and the Department of Fish and Game.The organization I work for, the Center for Biological Diversity, has gone to court to try and stop this wasteful killing, but as of this writing, the bounty hunter has already killed seven wolves from the Golden and Monumental Packs.Idaho is not the only state where wolves are being mercilessly persecuted. All of the states where wolves have lost federal protections have enacted aggressive hunting and trapping seasons that are designed to drastically reduce populations. In Wyoming wolves are now considered a predatory animal that can be killed at anytime, by any means, in over 80 percent of the state. Montana has upped its quota on hunting and trapping, and Wisconsin's management plan calls for culling the state's population by more than half.The unchecked state-sanctioned slaughter of wolves highlights exactly why federal Endangered Species Act protections continue to be needed for wolves. States like Idaho simply can't be trusted to humanely and rationally manage wolves. Yet, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is moving in the exact opposite direction and has proposed to remove protections for wolves across the lower 48 states, except a small area in Arizona and New Mexico, where the Mexican gray wolf is struggling for survival.With wolf populations in the northern Rockies and Midwest under threat and declining, this proposal will stop wolf recovery in its tracks and ensure that wolves moving into extensive areas of habitat in places like the southern Rockies of Colorado and Utah, the Northeast and elsewhere will have little chance of survival.During the comment period on the proposed removal of protections, over a million Americans spoke up in opposition -- the most comments ever submitted related to endangered species protections. Polling consistently shows a strong majority of Americans support continued protections for wolves. Yet, our politicians are continuing to listen to only the small minority of wolf haters.For the wolf to survive and thrive on the American landscape, we must make our voices even louder and demand continued protection and open hearts for these beautiful and beneficial animals.CORRECTION: This post previously stated that 200 coyotes were killed in the \"predator derby.\" Only 21 coyotes were killed."}, {"title": "Eagles Are Worth Fighting for Today", "text": "When's the last time you saw an eagle? A Bald Eagle, perhaps, perched in a tree along a river, or a Golden Eagle soaring overhead? I get to hear a lot of people's eagle anecdotes -- there's something about those big, proud birds that make people want to tell their eagle stories -- and I love every one of them.For one thing, eagle stories are a lot more common than they used to be, especially stories about Bald Eagles. By 1963, only 487 pairs were left in the lower 48 states. America's national bird, nearly wiped out by a deadly combination of hunting, habitat destruction, and especially DDT. The crisis truly touched people and unleashed a wave of concern that succeeded in restoring our Bald Eagle population, from Washington's Olympic Peninsula to the Hudson River. That amazing recovery has happened during many of our lifetimes, and it's one of the best examples of what people can accomplish in conservation when they band together to protect what they care about.And that's the second reason I love hearing eagle stories: Eagles bring all of us -- in red, blue and purple states and communities -- together. Eagles symbolize something deep and special that we all agree needs to be protected.During the bitter 2012 election cycle, Audubon teamed up with ConservAmerica, a Republican conservation organization, to ask people of every political persuasion to sign a simple declaration that we called the American Eagle Compact. It was a document that said we all want clean water, clean air, healthy natural spaces and abundant wildlife. It also had a powerful political message: We're sick and tired of conservation being used as a wedge issue by cynical politicians to divide Americans and chip away at our great natural heritage -- including our majestic eagles.So I believe that eagles can help bring out the best in us, and in that way, they're a powerful symbol.But a symbol that we have to keep protecting. See, here's the difficult lesson we're learning: We don't just get to save a species once and walk away, job done, on to the next challenge. We humans do all kinds of things that can devastate eagles and other birds, and we have to balance our needs -- like the demand for renewable energy -- with our responsibility to care for eagles and the rest of the natural world.The challenges eagles face are numerous today; some, like habitat loss and pollution, are old enemies while others, like human-induced climate change and collisions with wind turbines, are newer but no less serious.That's why Audubon is so concerned about a decision the Department of the Interior (DOI) made in December. The DOI is going to give wind companies permits to operate new turbine farms for decades, but without any real protection for eagles. Audubon does partner with the Interior Department across the country on a range of issues. But the facts in this case are clear.DOI has allowed the slaughter of hundreds (at least) of Bald Eagles and Golden Eagles in the seven years since Bald Eagles came off the Endangered Species list. Each of those deaths is illegal, but in all that time, with all those dead eagles, only one power company has ever been penalized. There's no cop on this beat; we've been told by DOI leaders they don't have the staff to enforce the law.That's bad for eagles, and it's also bad politics for renewable energy. Critics of wind power are already using the lack of protection for eagles as a new way to attack an industry that deserves all the public support it can get. That's a cynical way to undermine the critical need for renewable energy, including the best wind technologies, but the DOI has only itself to blame.Eagles hold a special place for Americans and we can all be proud of the conservation heroes in communities across the country who helped bring them back from the brink of extinction. These big birds are beautiful and majestic animals -- and a powerful symbol of higher human aspirations. They were worth fighting for in the '60s. They're worth fighting for today.The National Audubon Society has been working to conserve birds and other wildlife for more than 100 years. Consider signing up to stay in touch with Audubon and expressing your concern for eagles by sending a letter to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell today.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post for Save the Eagles Day, which occurs on Jan. 10 each year to raise awareness and support efforts to protect the once-endangered American bald eagle.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently announced the Pentagon's first ever \"Arctic Strategy,\" which is designed to protect American security interests as rising global temperatures melt polar ice. He noted that climate change is \"transforming what was a frozen desert into an evolving navigable ocean.\" This increased access will heighten tensions in the region as nations compete for newly-accessible natural resources and trade routes.We are creatures from different ends of our nation's cultural spectrum -- one from the military and one from Greenpeace. Even so, we share a vision for the United States in order to safeguard our environment and best provide for the future security of the nation. We call it Mutually Assured Survival, and we are encouraged that Secretary Hagel asserts his intention to address the long term in his short-term Pentagon decision-making. But he did not mention the most important piece of a long-term strategy -- the R&D funding necessary to eliminate American dependence on oil -- not just fossil fuels from foreign sources. This will prevent the need to engage in conflict in the Arctic (and elsewhere) as well as help prevent runaway climate chaos.Responding to this threat requires decisive action and consistent funding. Melting ice caps and the corresponding rise in sea levels will increase global instability as coastal populations around the world lose land, food and water. The only real recourse to protect any nation from future resource conflict is to decrease dependence on oil and gas, and increase alternative energy sources.Framing climate change squarely in national security terms is essential. Doing so de-politicizes the discussion, unifies seemingly disparate constituencies and allows R&D for enhanced energy capability to be properly prioritized. The military's experience as an innovator is urgently needed.The Department of the Navy, in order to accomplish its mission - -win wars, deter aggression and maintain the freedom of the seas -- is at the forefront of this energy innovation. In December, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the \"Farm-to-Fleet\" program. This groundbreaking program adds biofuels, for the first time, into the regular Defense Department fuel procurement process. There is one controversial issue here worth highlighting. The program requires that biofuel feedstock not interfere with food production. In the past three years, consistent demand has yielded groundbreaking innovation in this area, but fuel from waste remains expensive. Instead of corn-based biofuels, the industry can move to biomass derived from waste material, whether scrap lumber, forest debris or manure. With waste as the primary source of the new biofuels, this partnership between the Defense and Agriculture Departments can increase national security, benefit the environment, and in the long run, result in energy cost benefits for the American people.The Department of Defense is the biggest consumer of petroleum in the nation, and by favoring biofuels from waste, it will advance the technology and enhance the market for the next generations of energy technologies. Congressional budget hawks are concerned that fuel from waste is too expensive, and are gunning for this R&D budget. Just as early computers cost more than the magical ones in your pocket today (also brought to you by the Defense Department's invention of the Internet), new technologies become cost-effective only after pioneers stick their necks out. Aggressive Department of Defense R&D will eventually use the market to incentivize cost-effective energy production, and then all of us will be able to diversify our fuel supply without paying a premium.U.S. Marines are not often referred to as ardent environmentalists; however, Marines have taken on energy innovation as part of their ethos as America's professional warriors. By fielding alternative energy technologies like solar blankets and hybrid power generators in some of the most austere and dangerous places on earth, the troops are safer and less dependent on resupply.There is nothing more important for peace and stability than a transformation to a thriving low carbon economy -- one not based on fossil fuels or biofuels that compete with food for land and water. Those in Congress who want to starve or underfund this research are terribly misguided. Fossil fuels cost society trillions of dollars, paid by taxpayers, other businesses, and individuals. Recent studies show that air pollution costs more in health care than does tobacco.Every military engagement, whether full combat operation or disaster relief, requires tremendous amounts of energy to execute. Last year, the Defense Department burned 4.3 billion gallons of fuel at a cost of approximately $20 billion. As the single largest consumer of energy in the United States, the Pentagon is uniquely positioned to intensify innovation and drive global demand for alternative and efficient energy technologies. Clean energy innovation is inexorably tied to national security. As a peaceful successor to the Cold War's Mutually Assured Destruction defense, the Pentagon's race to advance clean and efficient energy is key to our Mutually Assured Survival.We cannot be timid. The myriad consequences of climate change are already compromising national security and financial stability. Only strong leadership and decisive action can protect our food, water, health and economy. We must support a Defense Department that empowers Mutually Assured Survival._____Amy Larkin, author of Environmental Debt: The Hidden Costs of a Changing Global Economy, is an award-winning environmentalist and entrepreneur and has led transformative initiatives with multinational business and Greenpeace.Siddhartha Velandy, Major, United States Marine Corps Reserve and author of The Green Arms Race: Reorienting the Discussion on Climate Change, Energy Policy, and National Security, 3 HARV.

After being nearly eradicated from the lower 48 states by the 1960s, bald eagles were re-introduced to the Adirondacks in the 1980s, and I'm proud to report the view from my home indicates they are flourishing in upstate New York.But this resurgence didn't happen by chance. It's thanks to a series of federal policies that spurred decades of work to bring this iconic species back from the brink. The most important policy of which is the Endangered Species Act. And we actually have the bald eagle to thank for its passage.During the first half of last century, bald eagle numbers plummeted due to excessive hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of pesticides like DDT. It was public outcry over the impending loss of our national symbol that in part compelled Congress to pass a series of wildlife protection measures, eventually leading to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973.The ESA has gone on to save hundreds of species from extinction, including the grizzly bear and gray wolf. In fact, 98 percent of the species protected by the law have survived. And one of the first ones, the bald eagle, made a remarkable recovery across its range reaching estimates of almost 10,000 breeding pairs in the contiguous United States in 2006, up from just under 500 breeding pairs in the 1960's. Bald eagles recovered to such an extent that they were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2007.Still, new risks are emerging for eagles across the country, bald eagles among them. And some decades-old risks still abound, such as habitat loss caused by development, lead poisoning, and electrocution by power lines. Protecting eagles from the threat of extinction is a conservation success story that we must prudently safeguard for future generations to come.Just recently, though, the Fish and Wildlife Service chose to ignore eagle conservation concerns and science when it granted wind farms permission to harm eagles for a period of up to 30 years. And they did so without any clue as to the impact that spinning wind turbine blades might have on eagle populations.It doesn't have to be this way.Striking a balance between wildlife conservation and wind energy development starts with understanding threats to eagle populations, and how our actions, including operating wind farms, are affecting them. This is the better path -- a science-based, conservationist approach to moving forward with wind energy and protecting eagles at the same time.A vast majority of Americans agree that we need to move as quickly as possible to the clean energy future, and scaling up wind power is an important part of our 100 percent renewable energy goal. Wind and other clean, renewable energy will help end our reliance on fossil fuels and combat the severe threat that climate change poses to humans and wildlife alike. This does not mean, though, that we can gloss over the potential problems if we aren't smart about how we develop renewables. Rather, we should address them head on and find solutions.Hopefully, the agency will reconsider its rule so we can move forward to scale up environmentally responsible wind development and protect our iconic eagle populations.As we celebrate the bald eagle on National Eagle Day, we should remember the conversation efforts that revived their populations. And we should apply those lessons learned to the new challenges they face today so that they'll be plenty of room for clean energy and eagles to soar into the future.For more information, please visit the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) website.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post for Save the Eagles Day, which occurs on Jan. 10 each year to raise awareness and support efforts to protect the once-endangered American bald eagle.

The linkage, which marks the first agreement in North America that allows for the trading of greenhouse gas emissions across borders, is designed to escalate the price on the amount of carbon businesses can emit.There is a \"potential for this market to serve as an example for other North American subnational jurisdictions to follow if it can prove to be successful,\" said Robin Fraser, a Toronto-based analyst with the International Emissions Trading Association.Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) opted to beef up its carbon trading system. Carbon prices are poised to rebound from a three-year decline after the 28-country bloc decided to back a stopgap plan to reduce the number of pollution permits that have flooded the market. As a result, the cost of emitting carbon dioxide may increase more than 50 percent on average to $10.54 a metric ton by the end of 2014.The \"backloading\" plan aims to remove 900 million permits from the EU market between now and 2016. The date on which the law is formally adopted will drive the quantity of permits that can be withdrawn from auctions this year.\"If the auction calendars can still be adapted by end-March, a total of 400 million allowances will be backloaded for 2014.

Last year, global carbon markets' value dropped 38 percent to $52.9 billion.EPA Power Plant Rule Open for Public CommentThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) draft proposal limiting carbon emissions from new power plants was published in the Federal Register Wednesday, triggering a 60-day public comment period.The delay between the Sept. 20 announcement of the rule and the Jan. 8 Federal Register  inking had prompted speculation about whether the agency was reconsidering the controversial rule requiring plants be built with carbon capture and storage (CCS) capabilities if they burn coal (subscription). The rule has drawn criticism from coal industry supporters, who say that CCS technology is not viable. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, sees things differently.\"We have proven time after time that setting fair Clean Air Act standards to protect public health does not cause the sky to fall,\" McCarthy said in September. She noted that the proposed rule, \"rather than killing the future of coal, actually sets out a certain pathway forward for coal to continue to be part of a diverse mix in this country.\"Another EPA rule that's meant to remove potential obstacles to implementation of CCS was also published in the Federal Register. This rule, according to the EPA, is expected to \"substantially reduce\" the uncertainty associated with identifying carbon dioxide streams under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as well as to facilitate deployment of geological sequestration.Eruption of \"Supervolcano\" Could Have Global Climate EffectsA new study suggests that the magma chamber beneath one famous national park is 2.5 times larger than previously known and that it could have the potential to erupt with a force 2,000 times greater than Mount St. Helens in 1980.Although there isn't enough data to predict the timing of another Yellowstone eruption -- the last one happened about 640,000 years ago -- study scientists say instruments monitoring seismic activity would provide some warning. That eruption would leave volcanic material and gases lingering in the atmosphere that could result in a global temperature decrease.\"You'll get ashfall as far away as the Great Plains, and even farther east,\" said University of Utah scientist James Farrell of the findings presented at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.Two separate studies in the journal Nature Geoscience suggest just how the magma in \"supervolcanoes\" like the one in Yellowstone blow sky high: the buoyancy of the magma exerting pressure on the magma chamber walls eventually causes the chamber roof to collapse. Though rare, supervolcano eruptions have a devastating impact on the Earth's climate and ecology, reports BBC.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each Thursday by Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions."}, {"title": "Congress:  Don't Put Harmful Trade Pacts on the Fast Track", "text": "Thursday, Congress pulled a rusty, old tool out of the bottom of their toolbox. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) introduced the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, otherwise known as \"fast track,\" that could facilitate passage of deeply flawed trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact with limited public and Congressional input. If fast-track legislation were approved by Congress, the president would be able sign the TPP and then send it to Congress for straight up-or-down vote -- with no room for amendments and limited floor debate. If that sounds backwards, it's because it is.First, fast track is an outdated and inappropriate mechanism. It was first passed in 1974 when trade pacts focused on traditional trade issues, like tariffs and quotas. Today, trade pacts like the TPP cover a broad range of issues including the environment, investment, labor, government procurement, consumer protections, and many more things we face in our everyday lives. It is therefore critical that Congress maintain its constitutional authority to oversee trade policy and ensure that trade pacts protect communities, workers, and the environment before the pacts get finalized.Second, fast track is undemocratic. If approved by Congress, the president could submit signed trade pacts to Congress for an up-or-down vote within 90 days with all amendments forbidden and a maximum of 20 hours of debate. Even more atrocious is that it would actually allow the president to write legislation that would change U.S. laws to make them conform to the terms of the secretly negotiated trade agreement.In other words, fast-track authority eliminates a critical constitutional check-and-balance structure that aids most other democratic processes. By stripping Congress of its ability to fully debate and amend the language of today's all-encompassing trade pacts, fast-track authority renders Congress unable to ensure that trade negotiations result in agreements that benefit communities and the environment.Third, it's a risky endeavor that could help rubberstamp very harmful trade pacts such as the TPP. The TPP agreement could devastate communities, our climate, and our environment. It would elevate corporations to the level of nations, allowing foreign companies to directly sue governments in private trade tribunals over laws and policies that corporations alledge reduce their profits. It would also open the floodgates for the expansion of natural gas exports and, therefore, fracking across the United States.And the real kicker is that -- despite these any many other consequences -- there has been virtually no opportunity for public discussion of the trade pact, as no draft text has been publicly revealed. So Congress is actually voting on whether to quickly pass trade agreements they've never even seen!Now is the time we need a full discussion about the true costs of the TPP and other trade pacts -- not a process to haphazardly rush flawed deals through the finish line.The bottom line is that fast track would set us up for failure. It's critical that Congress has the ability to effectively oversee trade negotiations and ensure that the contents of our trade agreements protect our workers, communities, and environment in the U.S. and abroad. The public and Members of Congress have effectively been left in the dark long enough. Now it's up to Congress to take the reins and oppose fast track. On behalf of the Sierra Club and our 2.1 million members and supports, I urge Members to oppose this fast-track bill and retain their right to ensure that the U.S. trades responsibly. You can urge your Member of Congress to oppose fast track, too.-- Ilana Solomon, Director, Sierra Club Responsible Trade Program"}, {"title": "The Health Risks Of Bedbugs, Beyond Bumps In The Night", "text": "About 40 used bedbug bombs greeted Mike Deutsch when he entered a small home in Hempstead, N.Y., last year.\"The first thing I thought was, 'Is everyone okay?'\" recalled Deutsch, an entomologist with Arrow Exterminating.Fortunately, no one in the Hempstead house had been sickened by the chemicals enlisted in the family's do-it-yourself eradication attempt -- although new studies warn of the potential subtle or long-term consequences of exposures to bedbug pesticides, including hormone disruption, reproductive difficulties and behavioral problems. Everyone also escaped unscathed from a duplex in Marion, Ohio, that caught fire during a heat treatment for bedbugs in late December.Research by the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention suggests that people are not always so lucky.A pattern of desperate, dangerous and often futile measures have Deutsch and other bedbug experts warning the public that bedbugs pose more significant problems than just their notorious nocturnal nibbling. While the epidemic fills fewer headlines today than when it resurfaced in the mid-2000s, experts also recognize that the bedeviling pests only seem to be multiplying further. A report released by Penn Medicine on Thursday suggested that infestations in Philadelphia are growing by 70 percent a year. Nearly all pest management professionals, according to a nationwide survey published in April, reported servicing a bedbug infestation in the past year.The issue has also captured the attention of several local and national agencies, which are now drafting and enacting legislation to promote safe bedbug control.\"People become desperate and will do crazy things,\" said Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann, a community-integrated pest management coordinator at Cornell University. \"Overall, the public health effects of bedbugs have been largely overlooked.\"Beyond the toxic chemicals sometimes misused to fight them or the house fires that can result from other efforts, bedbugs are associated with a variety of health concerns. The pests can cause anxiety, depression and lost sleep for those who face an infestation and the social and financial hardships that can come with it, Gangloff-Kaufmann said. She added that sores from bedbug bites may even open up avenues for infections, such as from superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which commonly lives atop human skin. While the general consensus remains that bedbugs can't transmit disease, some scientists are unconvinced and underscore how relatively little is known about the insect.People will also put themselves in dangerous situations to avoid the possible presence of bedbugs. As temperatures plummeted across the Midwest late last week, two homeless men reportedly chose to sleep outside rather than go into a Chicago shelter that's been battling bedbugs.Kevin Govert, one of the men, told DNAinfo Chicago that he does not want to \"get bedbugs again.\"No building is immune. Infestations over the last couple months were reported in libraries, classrooms, movie theaters, hospitals, jails and fire stations, among other locales across the country.\"Bedbugs are not going to go away,\" said Dave Stone, director and principal investigator for the National Pesticide Information Center at Oregon State University.Rising resistance among bedbugs to the chemical arsenal that once helped keep them at bay is making matters worse. One consequence -- and even a potential contributor to the insects' resistance -- is the tendency among some people to use more of the chemicals, and more often, should an initial application fail to eliminate the bugs.In November 2012, the CDC -- using data from the National Pesticide Information Center -- issued a formal health advisory \"alerting the public to an emerging national concern regarding misuse of pesticides to treat infestations of bed bugs and other insects indoors.\"Between 2006 and 2010, 129 mild and serious health effects, including one death, were reported from bedbug-related pesticide use, according to the centers. Stone said that while he doesn't have any updated numbers, the trend doesn't appear to have abated.\"Sadly, pesticide misuse is going to be an issue that we need to be vigilant against all the time,\" he said.Stone relayed reports of people putting the chemicals on their skin or on mattresses contrary to the instructions on the product's label. Victims of an infestation have been known to spray a pesticide not approved for bedbugs or for indoor use -- or even one that is outright banned -- further raising the risks of ineffectiveness and toxic exposures.\"The thought of an insect feeding on your blood -- it's psychologically traumatizing,\" said Stone. \"It really makes people desperate, and they do resort sometimes to things that can harm their health.\"In a study published in November, Canadian researchers found that the urine of nearly every one of 779 children studied showed evidence of recent exposure to pyrethroids, a pesticide commonly used in households and the central ingredient in bedbug control products. They are also the same pesticides to which bedbugs are increasingly resistant.When researchers compared the children least and most exposed to pyrethroids, they found roughly a doubling in the odds of that child exhibiting behavioral problems, even after controlling for other factors, such as lead exposure and socio-economic status.\"Since the whole bedbug epidemic started a few years ago, I'd been wondering if these chemicals had any kind of an effect,\" said Maryse Bouchard, an environmental health expert at the University of Montreal and co-author on the study. \"But we know very little about the health effects of pyrethroids. It's been relatively recent that we've used begun to use them on such a large scale.\"Some even newer bedbug pesticides are emerging under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's expedited approval process, which the agency told The Huffington Post is part of its multi-pronged approach to combat the epidemic. Many of the new products combine different pesticides in an effort to outsmart the pyrethroid-resistant critters. More affordable over-the-counter products are still generally pyrethroid-based.\"As long as labels are followed, there should be no concern about health risks,\" said Missy Henriksen, a spokeswoman with the National Pest Management Association, referencing all EPA-approved pesticides.But Ruth Kerzee, executive director of the Midwest Pesticide Action Center in Chicago, argues that even with the EPA's blessing, the jury remains out on the safety of the new pesticides, whether employed properly or not. Overall, the science on bedbug pesticides, she said, is minimal -- and so is the likelihood that a property owner will use a product precisely according to the label.\"We may not know the health effects until decades later,\" she said.Kerzee noted that the burden of bedbugs is particularly heavy on poor people. Without thousands of dollars to pay for safe and effective strategies, such as hiring a professional to organize and heat-treat all of one's belongings, low-income families are left with few options. Gangloff-Kaufmann's program does offer a series of illustrated guides in both English and Spanish on affordable measures to prevent and manage bedbugs, such as removing clutter in which bedbugs love to hide and \"making your bed an island.\"Moreover, shelters and subsidized housing for low-income families have been forced to close when building managers could not mitigate bedbugs properly.Cynthia Northington, program director at Chicago's Franciscan House and Annex, said she and her staff have been working hard to keep their 300-plus beds open (hers was the shelter passed up by the homeless men). Exterminators strip and spray all beds once a week -- a practice Kerzee discourages -- in addition to the shelter's other strategies, such as limiting guests to one bag and incrementally replacing mattresses and encasing new ones in bedbug covers. It's been a costly program, she said, and they've been actively seeking donations.\"Right now we're in containment,\" said Northington. \"But bedbugs multiply very rapidly, and before you know it, they could infest.\"Bug bombs or foggers can exacerbate an infestation by driving the bugs into different areas of a building, noted Henricksen of the pest control industry group.Bedbugs are so \"cryptic and insidious\" that they hide out in everything from TV sets to iPhones, added Deutsch of Arrow Exterminating. And while drops from a pesticide bomb may never even touch their shells, the chemicals could well penetrate human skin.\"People unknowingly put themselves in harm's way trying to get rid of these blood-sucking pests,\" Deutsch said. \"This needs to be taken seriously.\""}, {"title": "West Virginia Chemical Spill Triggers State Of Emergency, Widespread Tap Water Ban", "text": "(Corrects to remove stock symbol, FPET.OB, to make clear Freedom Petroleum Inc is unrelated to Freedom Industries.)By Ann MooreCHARLESTON, W. Va., Jan 10 (Reuters) - Up to 300,000 West Virginia residents were told not to drink tap water on Friday after a chemical spill called its safety into question, and health officials said water in the affected area should only be used for flushing toilets and fighting fires.\"We don't know that the water's not safe, but I can't say it is safe,\" Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water Co, told a televised news conference. The company runs the state's largest water treatment plant.Governor Earl Ray Tomblin declared a state of emergency for nine counties, and President Barack Obama issued an emergency declaration on Friday. The spill forced the closure of schools and businesses in the state capital.\"If you are low on bottled water, do not panic. Help is on the way,\" Tomblin said in a statement. \"We are taking every measure to provide water to you.\" He said supplies were moving into the area.Tests were being done on the water, McIntyre said, but he could not say when it would be declared safe for normal use.The spill of 4-Methylcyclohexane Methanol, or Crude MCHM, a chemical used in the coal industry, occurred on Thursday on the Elk River in Charleston, West Virginia's capital and largest city, upriver from the plant run by West Virginia American Water.Water carrying this chemical has an odor like licorice or anise, McIntyre said. While the chemical is not highly lethal, the level that could be considered safe has yet to be quantified, he said.A water company spokeswoman said the chemical could be harmful if swallowed and could cause skin and eye irritation.The spill originated at Freedom Industries, a Charleston company that produces specialty chemicals for the mining, steel and cement industries.UP TO 5,000 GALLONS LEAKEDThe governor said in an interview with CNN that there were several thousand gallons of the chemical at the plant, and it is estimated that at the maximum about 5,000 gallons leaked out.\"The old tank has been emptied and taken away and as of right now the company is closed down,\" Tomblin said.Tomblin said that when the Department of Environmental Protection went to visit the company on Thursday morning, \"they had to convince them they needed to get in to take care of this problem.\"Freedom Industries President Gary Southern said in a statement that the company was still determining how much Crude MCHM had been released.\"Our team has been working around the clock since the discovery to contain the leak to prevent further contamination,\" he said.Emergency workers and American Water distributed water to centers around the affected area. Residents formed long lines at stores and quickly depleted inventories of bottled water.\"It's just ridiculous,\" said Jaime Cook of Charleston, who was buying one of the last jugs of water at a Walmart store. \"There's nowhere to buy water and everywhere seems to be sold out. This isn't going to last two days.\"Tina May, a Charleston resident, even considered heading out of town for the weekend. \"I'm not sure how long I can last without a shower. This is unbearable,\" she said.North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory on Friday waived size and weight restrictions for trucks to expedite delivery of water, equipment and supplies to West Virginia to help them recover.The Kanawha-Charleston and the Putnam County Health Departments ordered the closure of all restaurants and schools receiving water from the West Virginia American Water company.Schools also were closed in many counties, including Boone, Cabell, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Pocahontas and Putnam.The spill was discovered after the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection received a report of a strange odor on Thursday morning and visited the Freedom Industries site, where they found a leaking storage unit, a spokeswoman for Governor Tomblin said.

On December 3, state regulators in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Northern Shrimp Section, who set annual catch limits for shrimpers, took a step they hadn't taken since 1978: they declared a moratorium.Citing a \"collapsed\" shrimp stock [pdf], the group's technical committee noted that the numbers were so low that there was \"little prospect of recovery in the near future\" [pdf]. Indeed, as the figure below shows [pdf], the Gulf of Maine's shrimp stock has declined precipitously since 2007 and is at its lowest level in at least 30 years.These days when a fishery collapses -- for instance, Bluefin tuna, orange roughy, and Canadian cod -- it is usually because of overfishing. An inspection of the annual northern shrimp haul [pdf] since the 1960s suggests that indeed overfishing may be at least one of the culprits behind Marine's shrimp collapse.Between 2007 and 2011, according to state data, Maine's share of the northern shrimp haul increased 20 percent while the fishery biomass declined precipitously. Higher catch rates could have depleted the population. But the rates of shrimp landings in 2010 and 2011 were nowhere near the highs of the late 1990s, and while the fishery in the 1990s was depleted, the biomass was about 10 times higher than now and the fishery was not closed. Seems that something else in addition to overfishing is at play here.Some suggestions for that \"something else\" can be found in the report of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission [pdf],\"increasing water temperatures and a decline in phytoplankton abundance (a food source for shrimp) are factors which likely have and will continue to contribute to the poor recruitment in the stock. The increased abundance of northern shrimp predators (spiny dogfish, redfish and silver hake) may play a role in declining biomass. Northern shrimp stocks in other areas of the world (Greenland, Flemish Cap, Grand Banks) have also seen decreasing trends in abundance and recruitment, providing additional evidence that environmental conditions are impacting northern shrimp across their range.\"Note the reference to increasing water temperatures. As scientists have been gathering for some time now (see also here), global warming could very well be one of the culprits in Maine's shrimping woes.But there's another part to this story, a somewhat different kettle of fish, but still relevant.A Lobster TaleIf Maine shrimp is a delicious coastal treat and a small but important food fish, Maine lobster is world-famous and a point of state pride and identity, even -- and an economic force for the state.My family often summers in the Vacation State on Mount Desert Island. It's a wonderful locale to be sure but the last two years have had an added attraction: cheap, abundant lobster.State statistics capture the situation: in recent years Maine's lobster haul has skyrocketed, resulting in plentiful, inexpensive crustaceans. 2012 was a record-breaker for highest lobster landings and value recorded, beating out previous records in 2011 and 2010 (see graphic [pdf]). Good news for lobster-loving tourists like moi, but not so great for fishers whose livelihoods depend on the higher prices that smaller catches nab.It's a Bit of a Puzzle and Maybe an Ironic SolutionWhile populations of Maine shrimp are dwindling, Maine lobsters are thriving. (Canada's lobsters are also doing quite well.) So why the glut of Maine lobsters? Theories vary. One holds that it's due to a decline in the populations of cod, sharks and other predators. Another that warming ocean temperature temperatures speed up the metabolic processes in lobsters allowing them to grow faster. If the latter is correct, it'd be an ironic twist of fisher fate -- global warming decimating Maine's shrimp fishery while enhancing its lobster fishery.But before all you lobsters out there start cheering on global warming, there's one more twist to this story to consider.For Lobster Populations, It's Location, Location, LocationThe Southern New England decline appears to be driven by environmental and biological changes [pdf] typified by the spread of a bacterial shell disease, rising ocean temperatures (which may be a root cause for the spread of the shell disease), and a loss in recruitment as spawning has shifted to deeper (and colder) waters. (A similar situation occurred in 1999 with similarly identified culprits but without a shutdown.)So Are Warm Waters Good for Lobsters?It's a pretty strange situation, don't you think? Warming temperatures are leading to a thriving lobster population in the Gulf of Maine while decimating lobsters further south. How so? Bob Steneck a marine biologist at the University of Maine explains things like this:\"Anything above 20\u00ba C[elsius] is extremely stressful for lobsters. While warmer waters off the coast of Maine in recent years have probably aided the boom in lobster numbers, putting us right in the temperature sweet spot for this species, we're getting closer and closer to that point where the temperature is just too stressful for them, their immune system is compromised and it's all over.\"And this is leading many Maine lobster fishers (and lobster lovers like me) to worry. With continued warming, could the disease that's been helping reduce lobster populations to the south begin to do the same in more northerly waters? The Pine Tree State is a beautiful state, sporting some of the country's most spectacular wilderness, but without its lobster and shrimp, Maine just wouldn't be the same. Could it be that going without lobster on a Maine vacation is but one example of the climate adaptations that may be in store?Keep up with TheGreenGrok | Find us on Facebook"}, {"title": "High Stakes of the Great Lakes: Invasive Species", "text": "As a representative of Shedd's Great Lakes and sustainability programs, I spend a lot of time talking with our partners and collaborators around the Great Lakes Basin about the many environmental issues surrounding this important ecosystem. Through these conversations, it's become clear that we as people tend to care most about the things that affect us personally. At Shedd Aquarium, our mission is to connect people to the living world, inspiring them to make a difference. Our hope is that by demonstrating how we're all connected, we can inspire people to care about and take action in their local environments.Earlier this week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) submitted to Congress the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) Report, the majority of which concentrates on management of the Chicago Area Waterway to prevent the spread of invasive species. The report also stresses the importance of education programs to help create awareness and educate the general public on the complex issues associated with Asian carp. Although it might seem that this is a localized issue in one city or state, Asian carp affects each of the 42 million people living in the 140 communities around the Great Lakes Basin.With the Chicago waterways right in our own backyard, Shedd has invested its time and expertise in developing a suite of digital tools to educate the Great Lakes community and inspire its members to take action. The new digital resources available online are twofold: the first is an online STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) curriculum called Asian Carp Exploration designed to inspire critical thinking skills while learning about how the Great Lakes waterways are connected and how invasive species are spread; the second is a series of easily shareable public awareness videos called \"High Stakes of the Great Lakes,\" which delves deeper into the issue of invasive species with interviews from the range of stakeholders around the basin.We are doing our part to help build awareness of the lakes' vulnerabilities, contribute to research to address invasive species, accelerate habitat restoration as well as protect and promote native wildlife. I encourage you to help too, by sharing the \"High Stakes of the Great Lakes\" videos on your own channels and to check out the new curriculum. It's my sincere hope that by sharing these engaging educational tools, we can spread awareness of these important issues -- it's as easy as click, view, learn."}, {"title": "How Much Do You Know About Marijuana?", "text": "Get out your thinking caps and put your cannabis knowledge to the test.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Ferret Thefts Plague Southern England, Forcing Breeders To Adopt Strict Security Measures", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's John Platt:Well this is weird. For some mysterious reason, there's a rash of ferret thefts in southern England these days, with dozens if not hundreds of the weasels disappearing over the past two years. Many breeders have reported losing numerous ferrets at a time, forcing them to put in cameras and other security measures.  The ferrets, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, aren't pets. They're so-called \"working ferrets\" \u2013 animals kept in rural England for the purpose of routing out destructive rabbits and other critters, a practice that dates back to Roman times. They are often brought into the fields where they can easily kill rabbits or chase them out of their burrows for capture and removal.  Professional ferreter Ken Jenkins, who brings his animals to farms in need of rabbit removal, told the Journal that nobody knows why the ferrets are being stolen, although \"there are lots of theories.\" Among the theories: the ferrets could be headed into the pet trade, illegal dog or badger fights, or pharmaceutical testing.  James Bradley, Jenkins' business partner, says the thieves are specifically targeting the animals. \"They leave everything of value and just take the ferrets,\" he said.Jenkins' ferrets wear radio collars when they are hunting rabbits so they can be easily located, but that might not be enough. The Wessex Ferret Club recently recommended that its members start microchipping their animals. An announcement on the club's web site says it has \"ferret theft is on the increase\" and \"it is often the case that identification is difficult as many ferrets look alike.\" The club now has \"people trained for inserting the chips into the ferrets. The chips are the size of a small grain of rice and will be inserted under the skin between the shoulder blades. Each chip has its own individual number which can be read by scanners held the Police, RSPCA and other similar bodies, who can then trace it back to the Wessex Ferret Club by the computerized register.\" The process costs a little less than $6 per ferret. The club also has a page about providing security for working ferrets.  The thefts have precedent. Dog thefts are on the rise in England, according to a recent report from The Telegraph. A few years ago the UK experienced a wave of pet tortoise thefts, often targeting now-endangered species that had lived with families for generations.  The biggest irony about the ferret thefts? The animals breed so prodigiously that many ferret breeders either have to give their male animals vasectomies or give away their litters. Why steal what you could get for free?"}, {"title": "Should We Count on Companies to Protect Us From Toxic Chemicals?", "text": "There's a good chance you missed one of the biggest but most under-reported business stories of 2013: Retail and manufacturing giants -- including Walmart, Target, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson -- are abandoning toxic chemicals in personal care and other products in favor of safer ingredients.This market shift is a direct response to mounting scientific evidence of harm from chemical exposure and to a groundswell of consumer demand spurred by groups like the Breast Cancer Fund, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and many others. It is an unmitigated good to have more non-toxic products on more store shelves available to more people.But peek behind this story of voluntary corporate action and you'll see a federal system that is failing to protect the public from toxic chemicals in our everyday products; a government so stymied that its work on chemicals management has been easily eclipsed by a handful of companies making a few corporate policy changes.Right now Congress has before it bills that, if amended well, would significantly reform our ancient laws governing chemical use in things we and our families come into contact with every day -- everything from baby shampoo to household cleaners to shower curtains. But so far, Congress has failed to act.And while it's significant that companies are stepping into the void, voluntary policies made in corporate boardrooms are not enough to keep us safe from toxic exposures linked to cancer, infertility and other serious health problems. A closer look at some of these new corporate policies reveal their limitations. Walmart announced it will no longer sell personal care and cleaning products containing any of 10 problematic chemicals the company has prioritized for removal, but is refusing to make the list public. Target plans to rate manufacturers' products based on the toxicity of ingredients (among other factors), but hasn't committed to making the ratings public. J&J and P&G are removing some very problematic chemicals from their personal care products, but others will remain. Simply put, we can't rely on these companies to voluntarily make the kind of transformative changes we need to ensure our everyday products are free of chemicals linked to disease.So while we applaud companies that are making and selling products with safer ingredients, to truly protect our health we need comprehensive reform, and that's only possible by making our democracy work for us. Let's commit to using our people power to demand -- louder and more firmly than ever -- that our government do its job and make sure that no company is allowed to sell us products containing chemicals that cause cancer and other diseases. Let's work to make the big story of 2014 that Congress finally outpaced companies by passing laws that restrict toxic chemicals in our everyday products.

A YouTube user uploaded video of the phenomenon in Glen Arbor, Mich., yesterday. The clip shows thousands of rounded, boulder-sized ice balls bobbing up and down in the water.The balls form when chunks break off the massive ice sheets that coat parts of the lake in the winter, Annie Lipscomb, a park ranger at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, explained to MLive. They gain their shape as waves in the lake ceaselessly toss them about, slowly rolling them into spheres.Depending on the temperature, some of the ice balls may keep growing. According to AccuWeather.com meteorologist Jim Andrews, the balls can build up more and more ice \"like a snowball or like a hailstone.\" Layers of water coat the ball then freeze.A similar marvel occurred last winter in Lake Michigan's Good Harbor Bay, prompting officials to comment on the impressive size of the ice balls, some of which weighed more than 50 pounds.\"It's not that it never happens and this is a once in a decade thing,\" Tom Ulrich, the deputy superintendent from the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, told UpNorthLive at the time, \"it happens more often than that, but these are very large and got bigger than they normally get.\"Watch the ice balls take over Lake Michigan, above."}, {"title": "2014: The Maturation of Clean Tech", "text": "\"First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win.\" -- Mahatma Gandhi  As a new year begins for the clean tech industry, maturation is a theme that comes to mind. And if we think of clean tech not only as a growing global industry, but as a fundamental global transition -- as so many of its leaders and participants do -- we can chart its progress along Gandhi's oft-cited dictum of other transitions in history. I'm not suggesting that the growth of clean tech is an exact analog to India's struggle for independence from Great Britain; that would be quite presumptuous on many levels. But with renewable and distributed energy as a metaphorical threat to decades-old entrenched ways of doing things, there are parallels to be made.The U.S. solar power industry, I think, offers the best example of Gandhi's progression. It was virtually ignored for years, except among a small number of devotees, and perhaps rightfully so; for a long time, solar PV technology was relatively inefficient and prohibitively expensive. That brought ridicule too, but the real ridicule phase came much later, with the 2012 bankruptcy of Solyndra. I hesitated to even write that name, thinking that the distorted spin sparked by that very old news should be dead and buried by now, but 60 Minutes dragged it out again in its Jan. 5 segment called \"The Cleantech Crash.\"Ridicule indeed. Ridiculous is a better label for the original Solyndra controversy, when an election-fueled political agenda disparaged the entire solar industry -- and often all of clean tech -- after the failure of one government-backed PV manufacturer. This conveniently ignored the game change within the solar industry, as prices fell 50 to 60 percent in less than three years, squeezing margins for panel makers but sparking the deployment boom that industry analysts (including those of us at Clean Edge) had long predicted. Plummeting prices, along with the solar leases and power purchase agreements pioneered by SunEdison, SolarCity, and others, made solar PV the affordable mainstream energy choice it is today.Which brings us to 2013, and the \"fight\" stage. Utility-backed efforts to roll back or eliminate net metering laws sparked battles in a dozen U.S. states, some quite contentious. The nastiest one, in Arizona, even included attack ads from out-of-state political groups calling SolarCity and SunRun \"the new Solyndras.\" After this fight, did the solar industry win? Sort of. Arizona regulators in November voted to preserve net metering but added a 70 cent-per-kilowatt charge for rooftop solar users (utility Arizona Public Service had sought roughly an $8 charge).Solar advocates don't like the precedent-setting fixed charge for solar customers (Virginia-based utility Dominion also has one) and we will see this type of fight play out in a number of states in 2014. At GTM Research's U.S. Solar Market Insight Conference last month in San Diego, Dominion VP David Shuford bluntly explained that \"[utilities] make money when they build things.\" And if solar rooftops generate enough juice to cut into the two percent load growth that Dominion needs in order to build things, the investor-owned utility needs to protect its bottom line. But just-departed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Jon Wellinghoff, on the same conference panel, countered that such fixed charges for distributed solar are \"nonsensical\" and \"wouldn't be sustained on appeal\" in court.Solar power's maturation has clearly reached the \"fight\" stage; it's big enough to be taken seriously. There's a wealth of statistics to choose from to show solar's growth in the boom year of 2013. In the first 10 months of the year, utility-scale solar accounted for 21 percent of all new generation capacity in the U.S.; in the month of October, it was 72 percent. And in an unprecedented court decision in the first week of 2014, a Minnesota judge ruled that utility-scale solar is a better investment for Xcel Energy's expansion plan than new natural gas capacity.Wind power, of course, has been big enough to be taken seriously for quite a while. The U.S. wind industry now finds itself in a new stage of its maturation: life without the federal production tax credit (PTC), which expired at the end of 2013. The industry has been there before, with disastrous results, but this time is different from the past boom-and-bust cycles of the 1990s and 2000s. I don't think the PTC will ever return in its previous form; the industry will likely lobby for some type of tax subsidy as part of a more comprehensive federal tax reform package. Hopefully, that will include the long-overdue opening of master limited partnerships to investments in renewable energy projects, which would most likely be wind farms. Rather than its own PTC, that would allow wind power to enjoy at least some of the same treatment as fossil-fuel energy sources, which is just as it should be.As noted above, I don't view Gandhi's struggles as an exact analog for clean tech. It's not that clean tech will reach a \"victory\" stage over other energy sources; it's part of a long-range transition away from coal and nuclear power to a future mostly fueled by natural gas, renewables, and efficiency.One sign of an industry's maturation is the movement away from venture capital and government funding. It's easy to point to the losses of VC dollars in clean tech (Tesla and SolarCity's successes notwithstanding) and declare the sector a failure -- and 2014 may bring winning IPOs from Opower, Nest Labs, and others. But that misses the much bigger picture of an industry growing up. Up-and-down business cycles are part of that process; it is not a simple matter of a boom that went bust.In 2014, clean tech is seriously challenging the centralized utility business model (be on the lookout for a U.S. Clean Energy Utility benchmarking report from Clean Edge and Ceres later this year which is attempting to track this clean-energy shift). Clean tech has established the first new successful U.S. car manufacturer in more than half a century. It's a critical part of any legitimate conversation about energy choices at the local, state, and national level in most of the world. Clean tech will still be ridiculed and fought, but its days of being ignored are long past."}, {"title": "Baby Polar Bear Takes His First Steps At The Toronto Zoo (VIDEO)", "text": "Cue the squealing and cooing!

They focus on cultivating a living soil, growing healthy food, and capturing renewable energy. In 2013, they used their grant to help 900 subsistence farmers in Lucknow, India transition to organic farming techniques, including purchasing a microscope and projector so farmers can see healthy organic soil with their own eyes, a generator and fuel for electricity when needed, and printed information that can be disseminated even more widely.

Is your dog happy? Sad? Frustrated? Lonely? The Bowlingual would offer a phrase to let you know. While intriguing, suffice it to say the Amazon reviews are a little sad and a lot tongue in cheek. No one seems to have as yet gotten the inside line to their dog's thoughts by using this type of device.Now, a small group of researchers at the Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery have come up with a newer, more technologically oriented device which they hope will offer a scientifically based glimpse into your dog's emotions. \"No More Woof\" is touted as \"the first device to translate animal thoughts into human language.\" It consists of a headset (which I'm guessing most dogs would have to become acclimated to wearing) with an EEG sensor that reads your dog's brainwaves and, via micro-computing and special software, translates them into human speech. Although the technology is still in development, the goal is to produce three levels of the product, with the price ranging from $65 to $1200. The lower end model will be able to distinguish two to three thought patterns, most likely \"tiredness, hunger, and curiosity.\" The most advanced model will allegedly program itself while in use. According to the website, \"Over time this option lets your dog speak short sentences ('I'm hungry--but I don't like this!').\" Oh, no -- I'm already imagining Bodhi's device sounding off non-stop throughout the day: \"Got anything to eat? Can we go out now? Pet me! Pet me! Pet me!\" The researchers do point out that the most easily detected neural patterns are \"I'm hungry,\" \"I'm tired,\" \"I'm curious, who is that?\" and \"I want to pee,\" so maybe it wouldn't be quite that bad.It would be all too easy to dismiss this sort of technology as a joke; I mean, do we really not know when our dogs are hungry, curious, tired, or need to eliminate? But I do think there is merit to the concept, and that it might be helpful in specific situations. There are owners who are either not very adept at tuning in to their dogs' emotional states, or are too distracted with their own lives and gadgets to realize their dog needs something. I can also imagine the device being helpful to a segment of the elderly population who tend to be forgetful, and might not feed their dog on time or let him out without a prompt. And while most dog owners do believe that their dog has emotions, it's always good to \"prove\" it to those who keep insisting on viewing dogs as robotic little servants who live to please us. After all, it's harder to get physically harsh with a dog when you know they've got feelings, too. I would love to have technology that would tell us once and for all whether a dog is enjoying training, or being stressed out by it. It would certainly settle some arguments between trainers who use different types of training tools.The No More Woof is a project in development, and funds for the prototype are being raised. If the product moves forward, no doubt improvements will be made. For now, we'll have to stick with the best technology we've got for reading our dogs' emotional states: our eyes, our brains, and our hearts.Nicole Wilde is a canine behavior specialist and author.

Given the extent to which it was frozen in the ice, it's likely that the animal became trapped several days before it was first spotted on Dec. 29.It's apparently not uncommon for a moose to become trapped in icy waters under certain conditions. The animals may be able to swim and bear cold weather, but they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long.\"If they don\u2019t have anything underneath to kick up off, or if it\u2019s so deep it can\u2019t reach the bottom, then they can have problems,\" explained Christer Moe Rolandsen, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, according to Views and News from Norway.Last year, another moose fell through some ice in Siberia.

No one was injured in either case.While it is not clear what role, if any, the older cars played in the eruptions, regulators are facing more calls from rail operators - who are responsible for the shipments, but do not typically own or lease the tank cars - to press ahead with new rules that would either force owners to upgrade the older versions or pull them out of service.The railroads and tank car manufacturers support measures to either retrofit or phase out the older fleet, but energy groups have opposed it because they say the cost of retrofitting roughly 80,000 cars could be prohibitive.CANADA'S LATESTTuesday's accident revived memories of a devastating crash last July, when a runaway train carrying light crude from North Dakota's Bakken region exploded in the heart of the town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, killing 47. That train included DOT-111 cars.The New Brunswick train derailed in a rural area near a small village in eastern Canada. A total of 19 cars and one locomotive on the 122-car, four-locomotive train went off the rails. Three cars, one of them a crude tanker, were still burning on Thursday.CN Rail did not specify whether the crude tanker still on fire was an old or new model or whether the newer versions of the DOT-111 fared any better than the older ones in the crash.Three of the five derailed crude tank cars were new DOT-111 models that comply with higher U.S. standards ordered after October 2011, CN spokesman Mark Hallman said in an email.Unlike three other such incidents, the crude shipment came from Western Canada, not North Dakota, officials have said. Some of it was destined for Irving Oil's Saint John refinery.Hallman said CN and the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada were still investigating the nature of the damage to the tank cars and the volume of product affected.The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is in the process of assessing feedback on proposed new rules on DOT-111 specification, but it is not clear when a final decision will be made or how it would be phased in. The Association of American Railroads has recommended that even newer models get upgrades.NORTH DAKOTA VISITAs new drilling techniques have increased oil production in areas of the country where pipelines are scarce, train shipments have emerged as the preferred way to reach distant refiners. Nearly one-tenth of U.S. oil production is now shipped by rail, up from almost nothing just four years ago.In addition to the rail car design, officials are also concerned that shippers may be incorrectly labelling the contents of their tank cars, which may be more flammable than expected due to the ultra-light nature of Bakken crude.\"There is growing concern that some oil shipments are improperly classified under federal hazardous material standards,\" Senators Rockefeller and Wyden wrote.Foxx, the transportation secretary, told lawmakers that he planned to meet with rail and oil executives next week in order to understand the derailments, and also to visit North Dakota's oil patch in coming weeks to see the situation on the ground, Hoeven, a senator from North Dakota, said after the meeting."}, {"title": "Lions Nearing Extinction In West Africa, Study Finds", "text": "By John R. Platt (Click here for original article)Physically and emotionally demanding. That\u2019s how Philipp Henschel, Lion Program Survey Coordinator for the big-cat conservation organization Panthera, describes the six years he and other researchers spent combing the wilds of 17 nations looking for the elusive and rarely studied West African lion. The results of their quest were disheartening to say the least. Back in 2005, before the survey began, West African lions were believed to live in 21 different protected areas. But now a paper about the survey, published today in PLoS One, confirms that lions actually exist in just four of those sites. Worse still, the researchers estimate that the total population for West African lions is only about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals of breeding age.West African lions\u2013historically referred to as the subspecies Panthera leo senegalensis, although that taxonomic designation is not currently in use\u2013are smaller than and genetically distinct from their southern and eastern African relatives, which are also in decline and currently number about 35,000 big cats. Recent genetic tests link them more closely to the extinct Barbary lion of northern Africa and the critically endangered Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) in India, which also has a population of about 450 animals.Although shocking, the news of the lions\u2019 near extinction should probably not come as a surprise give the context of the region. The populations of other large mammal species declined an average of 85 percent in West Africa between 1970 and 2005, mostly to feed the voracious demand of the bushmeat trade. The 11 nations of West Africa are among the poorest on earth and include six of the world\u2019s least developed countries. The countries in the region have no money for conservation, and the study found that most of the protected areas that were expected to contain lions had little to no enforcement, security patrols or management. National parks are frequently overrun by tens of thousands of domesticated cattle. Henschel describes many of the so-called protected areas as \u201cpaper parks\u201d\u2013conservation sites in name only.Devastating RealizationThe research team conducted in-person surveys in 13 of the 21 protected areas\u2013each of which was larger than 500 square kilometers\u2013and relied on field reports from scientists studying other species in the eight smaller sites. Although some of the work could be done from vehicles, that wasn\u2019t an option in many sites. \u201cDue to the complete lack of roads in some protected areas, we had to conduct all survey work on foot in those areas, hiking up to 600 kilometers through rough terrain during individual surveys,\u201d Henschel says. The research was also sometimes quite dangerous. \u201cEncounters with aggressive poachers, and, in some countries, rebel groups, were frequent.\u201dThe human encounters also illustrated some of the dangers the lions face (the cats are often killed as pests). \u201cIn many of the protected areas we surveyed, we also conducted interviews with various groups about the potential presence of lions,\u201d Henschel says. \u201cOne group we targeted for interviews were herders of the Fulani ethnic group, which is the largest migratory pastoralist group in Africa, and extends across all of West Africa. We often encountered Fulani herders and their cattle deep inside protected areas, and individuals interviewed almost uniformly admitted to carrying poison to kill any lions that attacked their herds.\u201dEven harder than the travel was the fact that the researchers rarely saw evidence of any lions. \u201cIt was devastating to realize that despite all this physical effort, despite weeks spent searching for spoor, no lion sign could be found in so many areas,\u201d he says.But their work was not completely in vain. They did find spoors, tracks and other evidence of lions in the four sites and ever-so-rarely laid eyes on an actual lion. Henschel says the most rewarding encounter occurred in Senegal\u2019s Niokolo-Koba National Park. They had been searching the area for more than a month under extreme heat\u2013\u201dover 95 degrees Fahrenheit even at night\u201d\u2013 when they finally spotted a big cat. \u201cWhat says it all, concerning the rarity of the lion in the park, is that not one of my four survey team members, all long-serving national park service staff, had ever seen a lion in their lives. It was extremely rewarding to see how excited they all were to finally have seen the animal that is also a symbol of national pride in Senegal.\u201dThe CountsThe researchers found the most West African lions in W-Arly-Pendjari, a complex of parks that crosses the borders of Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger, which they estimate to hold about 350 big cats. The three other sites in Senegal and Nigeria are each estimated to have fewer than 50 lions. None of the sites are anywhere near each other, as you can see in the map below:(The map also shows the sites of two possible but unconfirmed lion sites in Guinea. No lions have been seen there in more than 10 years, but the authors write in their paper that \u201ccredible reports of vocalizations suggest they may still be present.\u201d)In addition to their low numbers, the lions also live at a very low density of about 1 lion per 100 square kilometers. Lions in East Africa live in populations fifteen times denser. Despite this stretched out distribution, Henschel reports the good news that cubs were observed, both in person and via their spoor, meaning the cats are finding each other well enough to mate. \u201cLions at all four sites where the species was confirmed present are still reproducing successfully,\u201d he says.What Comes Next?\u201cNow that this massive survey effort has been concluded,\u201d Henschel says, \u201cwe finally know where lions remain and where we need to invest our efforts to save them. This was a vital first step, but the real work of saving them is only just beginning. Even the protected areas that retain lions are understaffed and underequipped. We intend to assist lion range countries in improving management effectiveness of the areas containing lions by helping them to increase the numbers, expertise, and operating budgets of enforcement personnel in protected areas with lions.\u201d He says that will help to \u201ccurb the killing of lion prey and illegal incursions into protected areas by pastoralists.\u201dBeyond that, the genetic material collected from lion droppings during the surveys will be assessed to determine the animals\u2019 genetic diversity and health. Along those same lines, the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, which determines the conservation status of wild cats around the world, is also tackling the thorny issue of lion taxonomy, which may result in new classification for the West African lion. The IUCN currently lists the West African lion as a population, not a separate subspecies, and considers it to be endangered. \u201cIf West African lions were indeed classified as a separate subspecies by IUCN/SSC, we would recommend listing them as Critically Endangered,\u201d Henschel says.Panthera president Luke Hunter, who co-authored the new study, also hopes that the world will take notice of these lions, which have been ignored until now. \u201cLions have undergone a catastrophic collapse in West Africa,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cThe countries that have managed to retain them are struggling with pervasive poverty and very little funding for conservation. To save the lion\u2013and many other critically endangered mammals including unique populations of cheetahs, African wild dogs and elephants\u2013will require a massive commitment of resources from the international community.\u201d Whether that aid and assistance will materialize in one of the poorest and least supported regions on earth remains to be seen.Previously in Extinction Countdown:Follow Scientific American on Twitter @SciAm and @SciamBlogs.

MoveOn's work is inspired by \"both the victories and the potential for more victories,\" said Victoria Kaplan, the group's campaign director.The group has selected 100 local activists from 37 states who are leading opposition to some element of natural gas development, from extraction to pipelines to wastewater disposal. Each will receive a $500 support grant as well as training and networking opportunities. The goal of the program, said Kaplan, is to \"increase the capacity of grassroots leaders who are already driving strategic campaigns in their own communities to fight fracking.\"Kaplan noted that the activists who have been awarded grants range in age from 16-year-olds to people in their 70s. A quarter are minorities and 60 percent are women. \"This movement is diverse in many ways,\" said Kaplan. \"That, I think, is a sign of a really formidable, powerful movement.\"MoveOn has provided what it calls \"opportunity grants\" to its activists before, but this is the first program, Kaplan said, to focus on a specific issue. The group decided to start the program after seeing an increase in the variety of fracking-related petitions and campaigns from its members around the country.One recipient is Susan Weber of Albany, N.Y., who said she has already used her grant to pay for ads to get people out to protest at Gov. Andrew Cuomo's annual State of the State Address, which took place on Wednesday. Cuomo has placed a moratorium on fracking in the state, but has not made a final decision on whether the process will be allowed in the future.Corlia Logsdon, another activist who received funding, is organizing against the Bluegrass Pipeline, a proposed gas pipeline that could potentially run through her property in rural Woodford County, Ky. She said she intends to use the grant to pay for advertising and signs for rallies in the state capital. \"We're up against a multimillion-dollar company with a huge advertising budget, and we're just citizens trying to defend ourselves,\" said Logsdon."}, {"title": "The Pyromaniacs Arrive With Blowtorches on Planet Earth", "text": "So here we are in a record-breaking \"polar vortex\" with Florida's Everglades going on a freeze watch and Minnesota registering wind chills of -60 degrees Fahrenheit. This most extreme of weather systems, which should warm the hearts of climate deniers, may in fact turn out to be climate-change related (thanks to a melting Arctic warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet). Meanwhile, halfway around the world, Australia has been experiencing a staggering heat wave, having just emerged from a year that included the hottest day, week, month, and overall average on record for that continent.Still, give the climate deniers their due. They have long claimed that climate science is, at best, a mistake-prone activity. It's a point with which Professor Steven Sherwood concurs. He happens to be the lead author of a study that just appeared in the journal Nature, focused on future cloud cover and climate change. It concluded that the planet will heat up faster than expected, minimally rising by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100 (which, of course, would spell unimaginable catastrophe). Here's his way of giving the deniers their due: \"Climate skeptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong, and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, but what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by those models which predict less warming, not those that predict more.\"Meanwhile, the year just past was generally a humdrum one in the new age of climate change. Though final results won't be in until March, it will be among the top 10 warmest years since temperatures were first recorded, falling somewhere between fourth and seventh. (By the way, the 10 hottest years have all occurred since 1998, nine in the last decade). For the first time in history, the planet briefly and ominously topped 400 parts per million of atmospheric CO2; oceans grew more acidic; droughts and wildfires strengthened; storms raged, though only one reached epic proportions, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines; Arctic summer sea ice had a major melt (significantly above twentieth century levels, but less than in 2012); climate change media coverage rose modestly for the first time in years; and one of the climate-denial movement's most beloved supports -- the supposed \"warming pause\" the planet was undergoing -- went down the drain.Meanwhile, predictions are starting to come in suggesting that -- if an El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon develops in the Pacific Ocean, as some scientists believe -- 2014 could be one for the record books.As the year begins, we know more about what's in our future with somewhat greater certainty and, generally speaking, as record amounts of carbon dioxide continue to pour into the atmosphere, we're doing remarkably little about it. To adapt that classic example of free speech limits, imagine that a vast crew of scientists is now continually yelling \"Fire!\" in the global movie theater and, as a result, more pyromaniacs with blowtorches are arriving all the time. After all, of those doing nothing about climate change, no one is doing more of it than the giant oil companies and the nations -- from Saudi Arabia to Russia -- that are in essence giant oil companies.As Michael Klare indicates in his latest post -- \"Peak Oil Is Dead -- Long Live Peak Oil!\" -- the urge of the oil giants and their supporters to claim that there are no limits on the future of oil and natural gas extraction is, to say the least, chilling on a heating planet. They seem intent on giving the phrase \"the sky's the limit\" grim new meaning. Fortunately, as our resident energy expert points out, they may be in for a surprise or two themselves down the road."}, {"title": "This Moment Could Have Easily Never Happened", "text": "It was a uniquely American moment and one I will never forget.Crossing the broad James River by ferry, with my wife and kids, we were our way to the Jamestown settlement. It would be our inaugural visit to the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, in what would later become to be known as the Commonwealth of Virginia. The kids were excited as we took in the sights of the river.And then it happened. A bald eagle soared high above our heads as if to punctuate this patriotic moment with an exclamation point. There was no mistaking this bird for anything but our nation's iconic symbol. Its stark white head, contrasting against its huge, dark brown wings. And even from afar, I could spot the sharp, bright yellow beak. The eyes, heck, everything about the bird, was fiercely searching for the next meal.What struck me at the time was that I had been alive for over forty years and had spent a lot of time outdoors, but had never seen this majestic creature, the winged representation of our nation's freedom, first hand.This moment could have easily never happened. This remarkable bird of prey, the bald eagle, was headed the way of so many other species and died out, at the hands of us humans. Hunting of the bird and our widespread use of the pesticide DDT nearly wiped them out in the early part of last century. Bald eagles once numbered in the hundreds of thousands in our lower 48 states were whittled down to 412 breeding pairs by the 1950's.Then we began to take notice. Our leaders passed laws like the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty and the 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act. But it took listing the bald eagle as an endangered species to really give our national symbol a fighting chance.And the near demise helped prompt our society to begin to recognize the inherent worth of the creatures with which we share this planet. Congress embraced that concept by enacting the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Recognizing that extinction is irreversible, the United States did what no country had done before, establishing what amounts to a bill of rights for animals and plants.Enacted in the midst of a worldwide extinction crisis that threatened the bald eagle and so many other species, the act reflected the resolve of a society mature enough to guarantee a future not just for itself but for the rest of creation, even if difficult choices might be required.Forty years later, America continues to stand behind that guarantee. The experience of four decades has demonstrated the importance of the act's legal safety net.Because of the act, today's children are able to experience not only bald eagles but also orcas, alligators, condors, grizzly bears and myriad other creatures as living, breathing parts of our natural heritage -- not as dusty museum specimens.Stemming the tide of extinctions is the most important indicator of the Endangered Species Act's effectiveness, but another is the unrelenting criticism the act has faced from anti-environmental interests. They target the act because it works.It works so well that the bald eagle can be spotted by a family, crossing a river, in full-on tourist mode. In Virginia, Minnesota, Florida, California, and throughout our great country, we can witness our national bird first hand, in the wild. And we know that this bird is not only a symbol of our freedom, but of our wisdom to protect all species and the areas that they need to survive.To learn more about the Endangered Species Act, please visit Earthjustice.org.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post for Save the Eagles Day, which occurs on Jan. 10 each year to raise awareness and support efforts to protect the once-endangered American bald eagle.

One of the first items on my agenda when landing somewhere new is answering this question: where are the birds? In North America I've tracked 728 bird species, and only two nesting species remain on my North America list: the Whiskered Auklet and Ross's Gull, both found in the most remote parts of Alaska.And, as you might imagine, the Bald Eagle has been one of the most glorious winged creatures I've seen take flight. I don't know a single soul who has seen a Bald Eagle in the wild without breaking into a grin.Photo courtesy of Scott Dickerson for the World Wildlife FundWhen the Bald Eagle was removed from the endangered species list seven years ago, it gave us cause to celebrate the work of scientists and land stewards who fought to ensure that this noble bird -- our national symbol -- would be here to inspire us still today.When I was seeking my current position, one of my good friends, a Princeton professor of environmental policy named David Wilcove, quipped, \"Now that you've been selected to lead an organization with a giant panda for its logo, your main job is to make sure it doesn't go extinct.\" The same could be said for the symbol of our country. Its recovery inspires us to dream about the possibilities to do equally important work elsewhere on the planet.Around the world, you'll find countries fighting to keep their heritage alive for future generations.\u00b7 Elephants stand as perhaps the most recognizable symbol of Africa, and yet in the heart of that continent poachers kill tens of thousands of African elephants (30,000 annually) for their ivory tusks.\u00b7 In South Africa, my colleagues revere rhinos because in that country is where we saw the greatest recovery of white rhinos. An amazing turnaround occurred from a population of just a few dozen white rhinos globally in the early 20th century to tens of thousands today. And yet over the past seven years rhino poaching numbers have climbed from 13 poached in 2007 to nearly 1,000 this past year -- all feeding a demand for their horns coming from countries like Vietnam.\u00b7 In China, only 1,600 giant pandas -- the symbol of that powerful country -- are left in the wild. But the Chinese government has mounted an ambitious effort to reverse those numbers and reconnect the panda's habitat.\u00b7 And in places like India and Russia, wild tigers -- among the most majestic animals on the planet; revered creatures that feature prominently in Buddhist and Hindu folk stories -- are struggling to survive. As few as 3,200 wild tigers remain.It's difficult to imagine the devastating impact that losing such significant creatures would have not only on ecosystems, but also on the culture and soul of communities whose history is bound up in nature.Saving the Bald Eagle required ambitious strategies, a devoted country and courageous citizens to turn the tide. We need to do likewise with the other world species that stir the heart, remind us of what's wild and beautiful on this planet and symbolize the powerful connection between all of us and nature. It is nature's very foundation that gives us the ability to feed our children, put a roof over our heads and inspires us to do great things.So as we reflect on Save the Eagle day, let's cheer our past victories and recommit our efforts going forward to save the world's magnificent species. Let's celebrate the Bald Eagle's recovery by stepping outside, and looking up.

One year later, the most powerful storm ever recorded to hit land devastated the Philippines.With these once extraordinary events becoming more ordinary, it's becoming clearer that businesses in vulnerable regions need to prepare. But how should companies go about building resilient enterprises that are ready to face extreme weather and other effects of climate change? One powerful, underleveraged option is to use nature to protect our coasts and physical assets -- that is, to invest in so-called \"green infrastructure\" a term meant to differentiate projects from more typical \"gray\" or man-made infrastructure solutions (such as dams, levees, and water treatment systems) that we build to cool and purify water or defend our buildings and assets against the elements.Our natural world already provides immensely valuable services to make our economy and society possible. Most obviously, we get all our food, minerals, and metals from the ground, and forests provide wood and oxygen. But there are more subtle benefits: forests also clean our water and coastal wetlands and reefs provide natural defense from storms and floods. They can help us manage rainwater and wastewater. These services, which are not currently valued in the marketplace, protect both people and commercial and residential assets.So a city or company looking to safeguard its water supply, for example, could invest in protecting or restoring lands instead of building a new water treatment plant (which is exactly what New York City did when it bought land in the Catskill Mountains in 1997 -- this initiative avoided up to $8 billion in costs for a new filtration facility and saved $200-$300 million in ongoing operation and maintenance costs).But is this kind of green infrastructure approach generally as effective? Is it cost competitive? A recent paper by Shell, Dow, Swiss Re, Unilever and The Nature Conservancy concludes that frequently, it is.Using standard cost-benefit analysis, the study compared some natural solutions to more traditional infrastructure investments. In all of the completed corporate projects, the green option won out toe-to-toe on capital expenditures and operational expendituresHere's one of the more compelling examples highlighted in the paper:One of Shell's joint ventures, Petroleum Development Oman LLC (PDO), uses constructed wetlands to treat produced water from oilfields. PDO's extraction activities produce a lot of oily water as a by-product. After investigating alternative, low-cost solutions to treat and dispose of the water, PDO built a natural wetland system that uses sunlight, reeds, and gravity (to flow water down in steps) in place of extensive water treatment and injection operations. The latter, gray option would have required significant electric power and produced high greenhouse gas emissions... and it would've cost a lot more.On every important measure -- capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and performance -- the constructed wetland outperformed the traditional approach. Power consumption and CO2 emissions were reduced by 98 percent, which lowered operating expenses dramatically. And as a bonus, the wetland provides habitat for fish and hundreds of species of migratory birds.In this particular case, PDO only needed the natural option, but the study concluded that hybrid solutions - combinations of green and gray infrastructure -- may often provide the best mix of benefits. Together, green and gray solutions combine some of the resilience inherent in natural systems with the way an engineered solution can solve a specific challenge.Shell isn't the only company that discovered the savings from green infrastructure. The report includes case studies for Dow, which also utilized a constructed wetland at one of its facilities, reducing capex expense by a factor of 10. Today, Dow is exploring additional applications of green infrastructure and is engaged in a multi-year collaboration with The Nature Conservancy on valuing ecosystem services, which includes evaluating the viability of natural infrastructure at its largest production site.Companies with common challenges can identify savvy, shared investments in green solutions for wastewater treatment, desalination, or coastal defense (using, say, wetland and reef restoration) and potentially collaborate on new green infrastructure opportunities at co-located assets.Collectively, the companies in the report concluded that green infrastructure solutions should become a major part of the modern engineer's standard toolkit: \"Incorporating nature into man-made infrastructure can improve business resilience --and bring additional economic, environmental and socio-political benefits.\" The report also provides an emerging set of performance metrics that managers can use to assess and compare green and grey infrastructure options.As the damages from (and costs of) extreme weather and other disruptions soar, investing in resilience becomes a better deal. And nature can provide many of the solutions we need to both save money and protect our assets. So run the numbers on green infrastructure solutions. The calculations are likely to show that green options are the best investments.This post first appeared on the Harvard Business Review blog network."}, {"title": "Peak Oil Is Dead", "text": "Long Live Peak Oil!Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comAmong the big energy stories of 2013, \u201cpeak oil\u201d -- the once-popular notion that worldwide oil production would soon reach a maximum level and begin an irreversible decline -- was thoroughly discredited. The explosive development of shale oil and other unconventional fuels in the United States helped put it in its grave.As the year went on, the eulogies came in fast and furious. \u201cToday, it is probably safe to say we have slayed \u2018peak oil\u2019 once and for all, thanks to the combination of new shale oil and gas production techniques,\u201d declared Rob Wile, an energy and economics reporter for Business Insider.

The exploitation of those shale reserves may delay the onset of peak oil for a year or so, the agency\u2019s experts noted, but the long-term picture \u201chas not changed much with the arrival of [shale oil].\u201dThe IEA\u2019s take on this subject is especially noteworthy because its assertion only a year earlier that the U.S. would overtake Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s number one oil producer sparked the \u201cpeak oil is dead\u201d deluge in the first place. Writing in the 2012 edition of its World Energy Outlook, the agency claimed not only that \u201cthe United States is projected to become the largest global oil producer\u201d by around 2020, but also that with U.S. shale production and Canadian tar sands coming online, \u201cNorth America becomes a net oil exporter around 2030.\u201dThat November 2012 report highlighted the use of advanced production technologies -- notably horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) -- to extract oil and natural gas from once inaccessible rock, especially shale. It also covered the accelerating exploitation of Canada\u2019s bitumen (tar sands or oil sands), another resource previously considered too forbidding to be economical to develop. With the output of these and other \u201cunconventional\u201d fuels set to explode in the years ahead, the report then suggested, the long awaited peak of world oil production could be pushed far into the future.The release of the 2012 edition of World Energy Outlook triggered a global frenzy of speculative reporting, much of it announcing a new era of American energy abundance. \u201cSaudi America\u201d was the headline over one such hosanna in the Wall Street Journal. Citing the new IEA study, that paper heralded a coming \u201cU.S. energy boom\u201d driven by \u201ctechnological innovation and risk-taking funded by private capital.\u201d From then on, American energy analysts spoke rapturously of the capabilities of a set of new extractive technologies, especially fracking, to unlock oil and natural gas from hitherto inaccessible shale formations. \u201cThis is a real energy revolution,\u201d the Journal crowed.But that was then. The most recent edition of World Energy Outlook, published this past November, was a lot more circumspect. Yes, shale oil, tar sands, and other unconventional fuels will add to global supplies in the years ahead, and, yes, technology will help prolong the life of petroleum. Nonetheless, it\u2019s easy to forget that we are also witnessing the wholesale depletion of the world\u2019s existing oil fields and so all these increases in shale output must be balanced against declines in conventional production. Under ideal circumstances -- high levels of investment, continuing technological progress, adequate demand and prices -- it might be possible to avert an imminent peak in worldwide production, but as the latest IEA report makes clear, there is no guarantee whatsoever that this will occur.Inching Toward the PeakBefore plunging deeper into the IEA\u2019s assessment, let\u2019s take a quick look at peak oil theory itself.As developed in the 1950s by petroleum geologist M. King Hubbert, peak oil theory holds that any individual oil field (or oil-producing country) will experience a high rate of production growth during initial development, when drills are first inserted into a oil-bearing reservoir. Later, growth will slow, as the most readily accessible resources have been drained and a greater reliance has to be placed on less productive deposits. At this point -- usually when about half the resources in the reservoir (or country) have been extracted -- daily output reaches a maximum, or \u201cpeak,\u201d level and then begins to subside. Of course, the field or fields will continue to produce even after peaking, but ever more effort and expense will be required to extract what remains. Eventually, the cost of production will exceed the proceeds from sales, and extraction will be terminated.For Hubbert and his followers, the rise and decline of oil fields is an inevitable consequence of natural forces: oil exists in pressurized underground reservoirs and so will be forced up to the surface when a drill is inserted into the ground. However, once a significant share of the resources in that reservoir has been extracted, the field\u2019s pressure will drop and artificial means -- water, gas, or chemical insertion -- will be needed to restore pressure and sustain production. Sooner or later, such means become prohibitively expensive.Peak oil theory also holds that what is true of an individual field or set of fields is true of the world as a whole. Until about 2005, it did indeed appear that the globe was edging ever closer to a peak in daily oil output, as Hubbert\u2019s followers had long predicted. (He died in 1989.) Several recent developments have, however, raised questions about the accuracy of the theory. In particular, major private oil companies have taken to employing advanced technologies to increase the output of the reservoirs under their control, extending the lifetime of existing fields through the use of what\u2019s called \u201cenhanced oil recovery,\u201d or EOR. They\u2019ve also used new methods to exploit fields once considered inaccessible in places like the Arctic and deep oceanic waters, thereby opening up the possibility of a most un-Hubbertian future.In developing these new technologies, the privately owned \u201cinternational oil companies\u201d (IOCs) were seeking to overcome their principal handicap: most of the world\u2019s \u201ceasy oil\u201d -- the stuff Hubbert focused on that comes gushing out of the ground whenever a drill is inserted -- has already been consumed or is controlled by state-owned \u201cnational oil companies\u201d (NOCs), including Saudi Aramco, the National Iranian Oil Company, and the Kuwait National Petroleum Company, among others. According to the IEA, such state companies control about 80 percent of the world\u2019s known petroleum reserves, leaving relatively little for the IOCs to exploit.To increase output from the limited reserves still under their control -- mostly located in North America, the Arctic, and adjacent waters -- the private firms have been working hard to develop techniques to exploit \u201ctough oil.\u201d In this, they have largely succeeded: they are now bringing new petroleum streams into the marketplace and, in doing so, have shaken the foundations of peak oil theory.Those who say that \u201cpeak oil is dead\u201d cite just this combination of factors. By extending the lifetime of existing fields through EOR and adding entire new sources of oil, the global supply can be expanded indefinitely. As a result, they claim, the world possesses a \u201crelatively boundless supply\u201d of oil (and natural gas). This, for instance, was the way Barry Smitherman of the Texas Railroad Commission (which regulates that state\u2019s oil industry) described the global situation at a recent meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.Peak TechnologyIn place of peak oil, then, we have a new theory that as yet has no name but might be called techno-dynamism. There is, this theory holds, no physical limit to the global supply of oil so long as the energy industry is prepared to, and allowed to, apply its technological wizardry to the task of finding and producing more of it. Daniel Yergin, author of the industry classics, The Prize and The Quest, is a key proponent of this theory. He recently summed up the situation this way: \u201cAdvances in technology take resources that were not physically accessible and turn them into recoverable reserves.\u201d As a result, he added, \u201cestimates of the total global stock of oil keep growing.\u201dFrom this perspective, the world supply of petroleum is essentially boundless. In addition to \u201cconventional\u201d oil -- the sort that comes gushing out of the ground -- the IEA identifies six other potential streams of petroleum liquids: natural gas liquids; tar sands and extra-heavy oil; kerogen oil (petroleum solids derived from shale that must be melted to become usable); shale oil; coal-to-liquids (CTL); and gas-to-liquids (GTL). Together, these \u201cunconventional\u201d streams could theoretically add several trillion barrels of potentially recoverable petroleum to the global supply, conceivably extending the Oil Age hundreds of years into the future (and in the process, via climate change, turning the planet into an uninhabitable desert).But just as peak oil had serious limitations, so, too, does techno-dynamism. At its core is a belief that rising world oil demand will continue to drive the increasingly costly investments in new technologies required to exploit the remaining hard-to-get petroleum resources. As suggested in the 2013 edition of the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook, however, this belief should be treated with considerable skepticism.Among the principal challenges to the theory are these:1. Increasing Technology Costs: While the costs of developing a resource normally decline over time as industry gains experience with the technologies involved, Hubbert's law of depletion doesn\u2019t go away. In other words, oil firms invariably develop the easiest \u201ctough oil\u201d resources first, leaving the toughest (and most costly) for later. For example, the exploitation of Canada\u2019s tar sands began with the strip-mining of deposits close to the surface. Because those are becoming exhausted, however, energy firms are now going after deep-underground reserves using far costlier technologies. Likewise, many of the most abundant shale oil deposits in North Dakota have now been depleted, requiring an increasing pace of drilling to maintain production levels. As a result, the IEA reports, the cost of developing new petroleum resources will continually increase: up to $80 per barrel for oil obtained using advanced EOR techniques, $90 per barrel for tar sands and extra-heavy oil, $100 or more for kerogen and Arctic oil, and $110 for CTL and GTL. The market may not, however, be able to sustain levels this high, putting such investments in doubt.2. Growing Political and Environmental Risk: By definition, tough oil reserves are located in problematic areas. For example, an estimated 13 percent of the world\u2019s undiscovered oil lies in the Arctic, along with 30 percent of its untapped natural gas. The environmental risks associated with their exploitation under the worst of weather conditions imaginable will quickly become more evident -- and so, faced with the rising potential for catastrophic spills in a melting Arctic, expect a commensurate increase in political opposition to such drilling. In fact, a recent increase has sparked protests in both Alaska and Russia, including the much-publicized September 2013 attempt by activists from Greenpeace to scale a Russian offshore oil platform -- an action that led to their seizure and arrest by Russian commandos. Similarly, expanded fracking operations have provoked a steady increase in anti-fracking activism. In response to such protests and other factors, oil firms are being forced to adopt increasingly stringent environmental protections, pumping up the cost of production further.3. Climate-Related Demand Reduction: The techno-optimist outlook assumes that oil demand will keep rising, prompting investors to provide the added funds needed to develop the technologies required. However, as the effects of rampant climate change accelerate, more and more polities are likely to try to impose curbs of one sort or another on oil consumption, suppressing demand -- and so discouraging investment. This is already happening in the United States, where mandated increases in vehicle fuel-efficiency standards are expected to significantly reduce oil consumption. Future \u201cdemand destruction\u201d of this sort is bound to impose a downward pressure on oil prices, diminishing the inclination of investors to finance costly new development projects.Combine these three factors, and it is possible to conceive of a \u201ctechnology peak\u201d not unlike the peak in oil output originally envisioned by M. King Hubbert. Such a techno-peak is likely to occur when the \u201ceasy\u201d sources of \u201ctough\u201d oil have been depleted, opponents of fracking and other objectionable forms of production have imposed strict (and costly) environmental regulations on drilling operations, and global demand has dropped below a level sufficient to justify investment in costly extractive operations. At that point, global oil production will decline even if supplies are \u201cboundless\u201d and technology is still capable of unlocking more oil every year.Peak Oil ReconsideredPeak oil theory, as originally conceived by Hubbert and his followers, was largely governed by natural forces. As we have seen, however, these can be overpowered by the application of increasingly sophisticated technology. Reservoirs of energy once considered inaccessible can be brought into production, and others once deemed exhausted can be returned to production; rather than being finite, the world\u2019s petroleum base now appears virtually inexhaustible.Does this mean that global oil output will continue rising, year after year, without ever reaching a peak? That appears unlikely. What seems far more probable is that we will see a slow tapering of output over the next decade or two as costs of production rise and climate change -- along with opposition to the path chosen by the energy giants -- gains momentum. Eventually, the forces tending to reduce supply will overpower those favoring higher output, and a peak in production will indeed result, even if not due to natural forces alone.Such an outcome is, in fact, envisioned in one of three possible energy scenarios the IEA\u2019s mainstream experts lay out in the latest edition of World Energy Outlook. The first assumes no change in government policies over the next 25 years and sees world oil supply rising from 87 to 110 million barrels per day by 2035; the second assumes some effort to curb carbon emissions and so projects output reaching \u201conly\u201d 101 million barrels per day by the end of the survey period.It\u2019s the third trajectory, the \u201c450 Scenario,\u201d that should raise eyebrows. It assumes that momentum develops for a global drive to keep greenhouse gas emissions below 450 parts per million -- the maximum level at which it might be possible to prevent global average temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius (and so cause catastrophic climate effects). As a result, it foresees a peak in global oil output occurring around 2020 at about 91 million barrels per day, with a decline to 78 million barrels by 2035.It would be premature to suggest that the \u201c450 Scenario\u201d will be the immediate roadmap for humanity, since it\u2019s clear enough that, for the moment, we are on a highway to hell that combines the IEA\u2019s first two scenarios. Bear in mind, moreover, that many scientists believe a global temperature increase of even 2 degrees Celsius would be enough to produce catastrophic climate effects. But as the effects of climate change become more pronounced in our lives, count on one thing: the clamor for government action will grow more intense, and so eventually we\u2019re likely to see some variation of the 450 Scenario take shape. In the process, the world\u2019s demand for oil will be sharply constricted, eliminating the incentive to invest in costly new production schemes.The bottom line: Global peak oil remains in our future, even if not purely for the reasons given by Hubbert and his followers. With the gradual disappearance of \u201ceasy\u201d oil, the major private firms are being forced to exploit increasingly tough, hard-to-reach reserves, thereby driving up the cost of production and potentially discouraging new investment at a time when climate change and environmental activism are on the rise.Peak oil is dead!

Nearly half of its projects have focused on providing solar for underprivileged schools and community centers here in the U.S.. Making solar work for the world's poor is a logical extension.\"By providing reliable energy to these previously unserved parts of the world, students can study after dark, medical supplies can be refrigerated, appliances can enhance productivity, and access to information and financial services can be increased, improving lives and alleviating some of the harshest poverty on earth,\" said Daniel Rosen, Mosaic's CEO.But make no mistake this isn't all butterflies and lollipops.

It is truly a Land of Enchantment.However, one area to address is the protection of significant historical sites and artifacts within the state's borders.This is a shame, considering the wealth of history that can be found in all corners of the state -- but especially within the borders of the proposed Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in southern New Mexico.In this region, citizens are fortunate to have a place that is the cultural and historic crossroads not only of New Mexico, but also of the entire Southwest. It is here that the ancient Camino Rael from Mexico City crosses more modern routes such as the Butterfield Stage Trail, which was established in the late 1850s to provide a route for mail to travel from the eastern United States all the way to California.Several key stops along the trail were located in the footprint of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument proposal. It's sad to note that other states, such as Texas and Arizona, have done a better job of highlighting the importance of the Butterfield Stage route for their visitors and residents.As an armed forces veteran who served his country with pride and dignity, there are the other places in the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks that are close to my heart and equally worthy of permanent protection.Did you know the region was a key site for World War II bomber training? It's true. In the deserts around Las Cruces there are 24 large bulls-eyes that made up the Deming bombing targets. These targets were vital training tools for Army Air Corps pilots during World War II, giving the pilots the opportunity to test secret navigational equipment. The mastery of this equipment ultimately was instrumental in defeating the Nazis.Considering the profound historical significance of these places, shouldn't we do everything we can to ensure their protection so that future generations of Americans can learn of the important deeds that took place here?This past December, I was honored to lead a tour for more than a dozen veterans to the Butterfield Stage Trail and the Deming bombing targets. Thanks to help from local historians and resource experts, we provided a unique opportunity to learn more about the region's storied past and our shared heritage as veterans and American citizens. After being a part of this tour, I am convinced more than ever that these historical sites deserve to be protected.The timing of the tour couldn't have been more perfect, coming one day after Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) introduced a bill, S. 1805, calling for the permanent protection of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks as a national monument.The veterans on our tour and all residents of the Las Cruces area know that a national monument designation will also be helpful for the local economy. One of the veterans on the tour, Bernie Digman, an Army veteran and local business owner, summed these feelings up nicely.\"When an area is declared a national monument it immediately becomes a sought after destination for travelers,\" Digman, who owns a coffee shop, explained. \"Last year, the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument was designated in northern New Mexico. Visitation to the area increased 40 percent over the prior year and business has picked up. The same effect will play out here in southern New Mexico and I am very excited about these prospects as a business owner.\"Thanks to the work of Senators Udall and Heinrich, the Butterfield Stage Trail, the Camino Rael and the Deming bombing targets would be just some of the sites protected. Also protected would be thousands of archaeological sites ranging from the time of Spanish occupation all the way back to the Archaic Period -- literally thousands of years ago. In total, the proposed monument would protect nearly 500,000 acres of wild lands ranging from desert grasslands to jagged peaks, a far-reaching area containing many sites of equal historical importance to the places we visited on last month's tour.I join Senators Udall and Heinrich in imploring the President to do everything in his power to preserve Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks for future generations to learn from and, ultimately, enjoy."}, {"title": "Cold Weather Brings Out the Climate Change Deniers", "text": "It shouldn't come as any great surprise that sometimes, it gets cold in winter. For much of the country, it's gotten really cold thanks to the polar vortex, which occurs when a whirlwind of Arctic air spills southward. When the snow flies, so does the misinformation from the climate change deniers, who have taken these cold temperatures as an open invitation to double down on disputing well-established science.From entertainers like Donald Trump to some members of Congress to some in the news media, climate change deniers have come out of the woodwork to mock the climate crisis and spread misinformation. It's just a small sample of a larger problem: There are more than 100 members of Congress who continue to deny climate change, and do the bidding of the big polluters who fill their campaign coffers.But don't fall for their spin: Climate change deniers are putting politics over science and our moral obligation to act, as Navin Nayak, LCV's Senior Vice President of Campaigns, pointed out on CNN's Crossfire this week.The scientific views on climate change are as solid as any public policy question will ever get. Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that man-made climate change is happening. In fact, scientists recently discovered that average global temperatures were higher in the past decade than they were at almost any point in the previous 11,300 years. They're also now as certain that humans are causing climate change as they are that smoking cigarettes causes cancer.Climate change is measured in years and decades, not in days or snowstorms. While it was cold in much of the U.S., December was actually a much warmer-than-average month around the globe. And the clear trend is that the Earth is getting warmer, just as scientists predicted. The Washington Post put it best when covering the polar vortex, saying, \"cold shouldn't come as a shock, nor should it have anyone second-guessing the reality of climate warming.\"As nasty as this weather is, it doesn't change the facts. It's time for climate change deniers to stop asking whether climate change is happening and recognize our moral obligation to confront it. It's why enacting President Obama's Climate Action Plan -- including limits on carbon pollution from power plants -- is so important.

We were rolling drunk on petroleum.\"-- Kurt VonnegutLet's play a game -- it's called \"How long can CNN talk about a freak wave of arctic weather across more than half the country without saying the words 'climate change?'\" I watched for 30 minutes today without hearing one mention of it, but I'm not sure if that means I win or the rest of the world loses as we continue to neglect the one thing that may do us in before anything else.Not Just a FlukeAs I write this, it's warmer in Siberia than it is in Chicago. It's warmer in Anchorage, Alaska, than in Atlanta, Georgia. Sixty-eight percent of the continental U.S. is covered by a wave of arctic temperatures that normally don't travel below Northern Canada. The official explanation for this is a bizarre \"polar vortex\" that's causing arctic temperatures to be pushed south.The polar vortex is always present in the Arctic, but strengthens in the winter and grows weaker in the summer. The vortex itself is a natural occurrence, but occasionally the jet stream pushes it further south than normal. And as the arctic grows warmer at a rapid rate, cold snaps like the one sweeping half the country will become more frequent. The jet stream pushing the polar vortex south in the winter may be more than just a fluke if rapid climate change continues.Rapid Arctic Ice MeltsOdd patterns from the jet stream were also responsible for the catastrophic flooding in Pakistan during its already wet monsoon season in 2010, displacing millions of people and requiring a massive global relief effort. That same year, the jet stream was also responsible for the unusually dry conditions in Russia that caused a swath of wildfires to erupt across the country prompting them to temporarily ban grain exports.In this graphic, the left side shows wind patterns in the Russia/Pakistan area under normal jetstream conditions. From 1968 to 1996, these conditions remained largely the same. There's a polar jetstream on the northern side, and a tropical jetstream on the southern side. But in the 2010 graph, a very oddly strong polar wind blew north of Russia around Moscow, going directly south into Pakistan. So how did those jetstreams affect weather patterns?  The northern polar jetstream usually brings extratropical lows and cyclones that make up the bulk of the precipitation in that geographical region of the world, and serves as the boundary between cold northern air and hot southern air. When it went suddenly northward as in July of 2010, it left those exposed areas unusally hot and dry and prevented necessary rain, making the area ripe for conditions like the wildfires that ravaged the forests near Moscow. The right side of the graphic showing the 2010 jet stream illustrates what happened to the precipitation that missed Russia. After blowing far northward, the rains suddenly headed southward toward Pakistan, causing heavy rainfall and widespread flooding.The extreme cold snap covering 68 percent of the country is a direct result of the rapid melting of arctic ice, making the jet stream more unpredictable. In 2012 alone, ice sheets larger than Canada and Texas combined melted, setting an all-time record for the fastest-melting polar ice in recorded history. Just in August of 2012, arctic ice melted at a rate of 35,400 miles per day. If this pattern continues, sea levels are expected to rise by 23 feet by 2020. And such a rapid change in sea levels will not only cause cities built at sea level, like Miami, to be completely uninhabitable, but will cause an exodus of millions of climate refugees from coastal cities all over the world. And freak weather events like Hurricane Sandy rocking New York City will happen even more frequently. If you think this current cold snap is bad, wait until it takes hold for an entire winter and happens every year.The Wrong WayAcknowledging climate change is real and threatening isn't a controversial issue. Even scientists funded by the Koch Brothers to refute the climate science making the case for man-made climate change admit that climate change is real, and that it has been accelerating since the industrial age. The science that showed carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere and channels heat has been around for centuries. The only people who disagree with the scientists studying the climate and telling us that we need to pay attention to climate change are the shills paid by the oil industry to spout nonsense on cable news channels (that depend on ad revenue from ExxonMobil). And 75 percent of Americans agree that climate change is real.Unfortunately, our government seems to be heading in the opposite direction when it comes to climate policy. Like a true capitalist country, the U.S. government is seeking to help corporations enrich short-term profits rather than thinking about the long-term future of the next generations of citizens. Oil has already begun to flow through the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, the construction of which President Obama fast-tracked.As investigative journalist Steve Horn has reported, tar sands oil continues to get dredged from Alberta, and trains carrying the toxic substance have been on an alarming path of derailment and explosion, harming the communities surrounding the rail lines. And the recent tar sands oil spill in Mayflower, Arkansas, was a sobering premonition of what would happen if the Keystone XL pipeline were built and ruptured near a crucial water source like the Ogallala Aquifer.Economic Benefits of Tackling Climate ChangeWe of course need to be mindful of our economy in this era of high unemployment and record numbers of people living under or on the cusp of the federal poverty line. But the minor economic impact from a few hundred new pipeline construction jobs would be exponentially negated by all the economic damage from climate change-influenced weather events. Hurricane Sandy cost the NYC metro area $50 billion. The impacts from the cold snap enveloping half the continental U.S. are likely to be staggering, given all of the roads, schools, and businesses that have had to be shut down due to the blistering cold temperatures and wind chills.But we can help our economy while also preserving our planet for future generations. By making massive investments in building a new sustainable energy grid across the country, we could create millions of new jobs in the construction, installation, transportation and maintenance of wind turbines, solar panels, and infrastructure to enable geothermal and biomass-based energy resources. The argument that we don't have the money is silly -- we've already spent $392 billion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that's still malfunctioning today. Discontinuing that project and investing in clean energy infrastructure could be the fix to unemployment and climate change that would benefit not just America, but the rest of the world as well. Wall Street is already betting big on renewables, projecting that 69 to 74 percent of new energy development through 2030 will be in green energy.We need to get serious about addressing what we're doing to our climate in our reckless consumption of fossil fuels, or we'll have many more cold winters, hot summers, and climate-related weather disasters in our future. This cold snap is a harsh, constant lesson taught to us by our planet, and if we fail this test, the next one will be even harder.This article originally appeared on Reader Supported News."}, {"title": "Sea Lion Poop In La Jolla, Califorinia Irks Business Owners", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Matt Hickman:First neighbor-irking demolition projects and now the \u201cfoul, noxious, and sickening\u201d stench of sea lion poop wafting in from the cove \u2026  The blows truly seem to keep on coming for residents living in the sleepy seaside enclave of La Jolla, Calif. where plutocrat/prolific granddad Mitt Romney has already disrupted the peace by razing his modestly proportioned beach house with plans to erect a hulking mansion, complete with the largest basement known to mankind, in its place. On top of that, beleaguered La Jolla residents are struggling with an odor so pungent, so persistent that even celebrated boxing champ Floyd Mayweather has hightailed it out of there and fled for less rank grounds.  A collective of concerned La Jolla business owners calling itself Citizens for Odor Nuisance Abatement recently sued the city of San Diego in hopes that authorities will take action and do something about the source of the offending odor: a cluster of rocks in La Jolla Cove that are used by sea lions, cormorants, and other forms of marine life as a communal latrine.  Several years ago, city officials approved the construction of a white wooden fence geared to prevent people from getting too close to the sea lions, which, if you think about it, makes total sense as the blubbery beasts are federally protected from being harassed. But as the lawsuit alleges, because the fence prohibits people from accessing the rocks where they could potentially harm the animals or themselves, the birds and sea lions see absolutely no reason to move further out into the cove to take care of business. And without human interruption, the rocks have become the site of a big old poop party.  The lawsuit also notes that the omnipresent stench is particularly horrific due to the sea lions\u2019 anchovy-rich diet \u2014 it \"makes the smell much worse than it might otherwise be.\"   Due to the olfactory terror that\u2019s gripped the area, the owners of a handful of upscale restaurants and hotels situated above La Jolla Cove have complained of lost business. As reported by the Los Angeles Times, La Valencia Hotel lost $5,000 in one day\u2019s rooms revenue when Mayweather and his entourage checked into \u2014 and quickly checked out of 15 minutes later \u2014 two villas and six guest rooms because of the smell.  The city of San Diego has responded to similar odor complaints in the past including funding a $50,000 clean-up operation in early 2013 to rid the cliffs above La Jolla Cove of decades of accumulated bird poop. But as those living and working near the cove will probably tell you, the period of relief following the cleaning was short-lived and in recent months the displeasing aroma has returned worse than ever due in part to a surge in the sea lion population.  It's believed that taking down the fence and permitting people \u2014 people donning gas masks, no doubt \u2014 to access the bluffs again will once again bring relief, this time more long-lasting.  Just days prior to the lawsuit being filed, city officials actually did decide to install a gate in the offending fence that would allow people to access the bluffs and, in turn, keep defecating animals at more of a remove. Explains Alex Roth, spokesman for Acting Mayor Todd Gloria: \"You can't put yourself in danger or actively harass the wildlife, but you can go down to the cliffs. We hope this will alleviate the problem.\"  Bryan Pease, a pro bono attorney representing Citizens for Odor Nuisance Abatement, thinks that the addition of the gate, which, again, was apparently not in response to the aforementioned lawsuit filed by his client, is a fine start in rectifying the \u201cpotential health hazard and serious public nuisance\u201d \u2014 but not enough to do the trick. \u201cI don't think this one small gate will be enough. There is another long, flat rock area that is still inaccessible and contributing to the odor,\u201d he explains to the L.A. Times.

Legal pot shops opened to great fanfare with customers lined up at 2 a.m., some arriving in limos, others carrying guitars to serenade the crowd. Similar celebrations are expected later this year when the marijuana industry opens in Washington state. Elsewhere in the country, similar legalization bills have been introduced and political leaders aren't putting up much of a fight. President Obama has said there are \"bigger fish to fry\" than prosecuting marijuana users -- almost 60 percent of Americans reported to pollsters that they agree.The tide has turned. Even those of us who are opposed must acknowledge it. But if legalization is indeed inevitable, we must prepare for the consequences: Usage will go up. It already has as a result of the widespread legalization of medical marijuana. Teen use of marijuana has reached a 30-year high with one of out every 15 high school seniors smoking marijuana on a near daily basis. What's more, fewer and fewer teens see pot as risky, which could foretell even greater usage in the future. As usage continues to increase, we must begin to anticipate and plan how we will be able to identify and treat the individuals who have abuse or addiction problems.The shift in public sentiment around legalization is tied to the perception that marijuana is not addictive. For 90 percent of adults and 84 percent of teens, this is true. For the other 10 percent of adults and 16 percent of teens, marijuana is as dangerous and destructive as any other illicit substance.At Phoenix House, we see in terrible detail the devastation marijuana can cause. For almost all of the kids we treat, marijuana is a problem. About 70 percent of our teen admissions nationally list marijuana as their primary drug of choice. We serve some of the country's most vulnerable teens. These young people are with us because marijuana has seriously impacted their lives, making it impossible for them to succeed in school, ruining their relationships with their families, and often, leading them to try even more harmful drugs when they seek an even greater high.   Currently, 57 percent of people admitted to treatment facilities for marijuana abuse or addiction are referred by the criminal justice system. By the time an individual has an encounter with the law, their drug use has very likely escalated to drug abuse or addiction. It is far from ideal that our country relies on the criminal justice system to be the main interceptor of individuals whose use of marijuana is problematic. That's why we support decriminalization over incarceration -- because you can't cure a disease with handcuffs. However, without a better alternative in place, marijuana legalization removes the one backstop we have for identifying and helping individuals who need some form of treatment, whether brief intervention or a long-term treatment program, before they slip through the cracks.Imagine if we had systems in place that could identify symptoms early on and spare individuals and their loved ones the heartache and struggle of full-blown addiction and all its terrible consequences.There's a lot of work to do to make that happen.  First, our health care system must change. Emergency room physicians and primary care providers need training to recognize the varying degrees of marijuana dependency -- and then know how to intervene. Marijuana affects a person differently than alcohol or illicit drugs, and medical care providers need to be able to tell the difference between occasional recreational use, a problem, and addiction. There also needs to be more collaboration with treatment providers so that doctors can refer patients to places where they can get help.  Second, the treatment community needs to advance and adapt. We need to provide a much broader spectrum of treatment options, so that individuals in the early stages of marijuana abuse can seek help tailored to their needs. People may be more inclined to seek treatment when they feel like it does not mean wearing the scarlet letter of \"addict\" or \"criminal.\"Third, health care reform will provide insurance coverage to millions of individuals who are uninsured and allow them to get coverage for treatment. Paired with legalization of marijuana, this policy change could result in more patients struggling with marijuana abuse. We need to have a dynamic diagnostic, referral and treatment system in place to support this wave of new patients.  We also need to watch Colorado and Washington closely -- and objectively -- to see how legalization will play out. Will substance abuse rates increase? Will marijuana users be more likely to use other illegal substances? How will states deal with legal driving limits? I believe we will soon see just how harmful and dangerous marijuana is, and I think the public will be surprised.  Finally, family and friends are the first line of defense for loved ones struggling with marijuana abuse and addiction, and we all must be vigilant about the signs and informed and empowered to help.To be sure, there is a silver lining in marijuana legalization. It will undoubtedly demonstrate that we need to put a better system in place for helping the millions of Americans who have a substance abuse disorder, but are not getting the treatment they need. We have a real opportunity now to create the education initiatives and programs that will enable a much bigger community -- healthcare providers, teachers, family and friends -- to spot a problem and step in to help."}, {"title": "Wall Street Giant Backs Away From Washington Coal Export Facility", "text": "A multinational banking giant is backing away from a proposal to build the West Coast\u2019s biggest coal export project near Bellingham, Washington.Read more on Oregon Public Broadcasting"}, {"title": "Biking Into the Future", "text": "A few weeks ago, I was asked by a reporter, \"What's the future of transportation?\" He was wondering if I foresaw any far-out types of cars powered by some strange sustainable fuel like water, helium or carbon dioxide. I wasn't taking the bait. I don't think cars are the future of transportation. Bikes are -- or at least, a big part of it.We've all heard about the huge efforts of places like New York and Seattle -- throwing millions of dollars at making cycling as viable a transit option as taxis, rail and walking. But other, lesser known, places like Columbia, SC, Raleigh, NC and Rochester, NY have jumped into the mix as well. Over the last decade, hundreds, if not thousands, of small, medium and large cities have gone through the process to master-plan bike networks for their citizens. It's a trend that's not slowing down. Literally every week, it seems a new RFQ comes out asking for proposals to envision a citywide bike plan for another town or community.It speaks to a great change happening under the noise and dysfunction of our more mainstream conversation about climate change, cities and the future. If every master plan is enacted, it could mean, over the next decade, millions of cars being left in the garage for the more healthy peddling experience of cycling to work, recreation and commerce. This could lead to parking lots being replaced by fields of bike racks, and bike-share programs replacing the need for intercity public transit. Of course, obstacles are standing in the way. The funding is missing to build the new infrastructure to support safety for this new bicycling culture. But the money issue is really about our bad habits for designing and planning places.We institutionally believe that for infrastructure to be good and thereby serve the community, it needs to be expensive and \"comprehensive\". Many of the bike master plans, though new and innovative, have fallen into this old pattern of city and transit planning. Community involvement is limited to a mandatory protocol, and ideas are always counterbalanced by the status quo. Most of the bike network plans are huge hundred page documents with costly improvements and implementation goals that will take decades to enact.Unfortunately, another big issue surrounding successful programs is that a small group of companies are designing the majority of bike networks and bike shares. They are also, by default, the companies that cities, counties and transit departments turn to for standards and requirements as well as assistance in writing the many RFPs coming out. I don't want this to sound too sinister, because as any design professional knows, having the \"experts\" assist in writing RFPs is standard operation for all types of design from architecture, landscape and engineering as well as transportation. The real problem that comes from this is that we have a small group of people defining the performance standards for millions of people -- with little need or necessity to think creatively or from a different perspective.We need to learn from our mistakes. Car culture was not brought to us by a community driven effort for better transit design. It was brought about because a small group of companies banded together to imprint their vision of highways, strip malls and the privatization of travel. If anything, how a city or suburb redefines itself as a bike mecca shouldn't be a cookie cutter approach, but should be a highly individualized process that reaches deep into the existing communities and neighborhoods for input and implementation.The beauty of the problems we face with bicycle networks is that counter approaches exist and are accessible. A new line of design is emerging that is redefining infrastructure overall. This being, instead of expensive top-down city planning, neighborhoods and communities can have extremely inexpensive options tested and installed for -- hold onto your hats -- pennies. One of the most inspiring methods out there is called Tactical Urbanism -- but it is only one of several new tools available to people.In a recent interview for OCD:Designcast, my co-host and I had the opportunity to talk to Mike Lydon, the founder of Tactical Urbanism and discuss many of the big and small issues for reimagining cities, suburbs and transportation using a people-scaled and community-driven approach.This is really just the beginning of the conversation, and not the conclusion. The real question is, what should an individualized transit planning process look like? Are the existing standards helping us get to a bike-centric future or slowing us down? And where do we go next for engaging people in this new and rich world of peddling about to the places we shop, work and live?"}, {"title": "They Finally Figured Out How That Blood-Red Stream Got Its Color", "text": "The mystery of a stream\u2019s spontaneous blood-red coloring has been solved.An Environmental Agency investigation of the stream in Northamptonshire, England, revealed that the bizarre coloring is the result of a large red ink spillage, according to the Northampton Chronicle.Locals were likening the seemingly gory sight to a scene from a horror film.\u201cAt first I thought something had died as it looked like blood but when it was all the way along we said it must have been a whale to create that much blood,\" Northampton resident Pep Finn-Scinaldi, 28, told the news outlet.Story continues below  A stream in Northamptonshire turned a deep shade of red due to a nearby ink spillage.An EA spokesman confirmed to HuffPost UK that the color change was caused by water-based ink.

Kaplan.While both sides paid for translators during the trial, trying a case as complicated as Chevron's retaliatory racketeering lawsuit against the Ecuadorians and their counsel was confusing enough in English much less in Spanish.Much got lost in translation, including justice for Gomez's clients.No U.S. court has jurisdiction over another country's judicial system, even when that system rules against a U.S.-based corporation that just happens to be responsible for the deliberate contamination of Ecuador's rainforest. That Texaco, now owned by Chevron, admitted to having dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic water into the rainforest's waterways and abandoned hundreds of huge, unlined waste pits filled with pure crude and other toxins is NOT in dispute.What is in dispute is who is responsible, and Ecuador's highest court has upheld the decision. It's Chevron.Now Chevron wants a U.S. court opinion that says that's wrong. But imagine a U.S. judge sitting in judgment of the decision of a British or German court and declaring it unenforceable and fraudulent. It would never happen. And it certainly shouldn't happen in a case where the defendant (Chevron) wanted the case tried in Ecuador in the first place, begging and pleading with U.S. courts to send it there.Ecuador, though, is a small country that has commanded almost no respect in Kaplan's courtroom for the past three years. In fact, Kaplan has treated the country with a level of nastiness that violates basic principles of comity between nations. He recently remarked from the bench about  Ecuador's judiciary: \"[b]elieve me, if this were the High Court in London, you can be sure I'd wait\" (on a ruling then before the Ecuador court).But wait for an Ecuador court? Not a chance.Kaplan even claimed the underlying case affirmed by Ecuador's Supreme Court was \"not bona fide litigation\". In his decisions, he has consistently called the villagers the \"so-called\" plaintiffs, suggesting they might not even exist.There's also this telling comment about the lawsuit from a Chevron lobbyist: \"We can't let little countries like Ecuador screw around with large companies.\"No indeed.In traveling to Latin America and working with people from Ecuador, Columbia, Brazil and Argentina, I often hear the same refrain: \"Americans are arrogant. They think they know it all.\"The way the Ecuadorians have been treated by the U.S. court system, as well as by some U.S. reporters covering the trial in front of Kaplan, has done nothing to change this view. For example:\u2022 During the trial, Judge Kaplan struck large sections of written and oral testimony about Chevron's contamination of the rainforest, declaring that it had nothing to do with Chevron's charge that the lawsuit itself is fraudulent and that the Ecuadorians' lawyers and other advocates have lied about the contamination in order to\"extort\" money from the oil company.Don't ask me to explain the inexplicable. I can't. I've seen the contamination with my own eyes. I've talked to people who have lost their loved ones to cancer due to exposures to toxins left behind by Chevron. I've seen the overwhelming scientific evidence against Chevron. This lawsuit is anything but fraudulent.As a Canadian appellate judge recently wrote in a ruling allowing the Ecuadorians to attempt to seize Chevron assets in that country: \"...the Ecuadorean plaintiffs deserve to have the ...enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction.\"Because Chevron refuses to pay the court judgment, the villagers have filed collection actions in Canada, Brazil and Argentina to seize Chevron's assets so they can generate funds to clean up their ancestral lands. The RICO lawsuit in the U.S. is nothing less than Chevron's latest attempt to block those asset seizures and ultimately to obtain impunity for its wrongdoing.\u2022 A clerk of Kaplan's rolled her eyes and smirked when Javier Piaguaje, one of the Ecuadorians who sued Chevron, walked into the courtroom wearing the traditional dress of his indigenous tribe, the Secoya. Piaguaje has lost family members to cancer and was set to testify about the contamination -- until Chevron's lawyers objected and the judge excluded that portion of his testimony. The clerk's bold show of disrespect for Piaguaje and his plight was jarring to someone like myself who hasn't spent a lot of time in a courtroom. If this kind of behavior is fairly common, then I can certainly understand better why American citizens of color often say they are intimidated by the U.S. judiciary.\u2022 Another Ecuadorian, Donald Moncayo, who organizes tours of the contaminated areas in the rainforest, traveled for two days from the rainforest to New York's concrete jungle to testify. While on the stand, he mentioned his laptop. Judge Kaplan asked Moncayo if had the laptop with him in New York. When he answered, yes, Kaplan turned to Chevron's lawyer, Randy Mastro, and said, \"Take it from here, Mr. Mastro.\" Mastro then motioned to seize the laptop, and Kaplan ordered it turned over to Chevron within two hours. Since Moncayo was not one of the named defendants in Chevron's RICO case, he had no legal representation. Kaplan denied motions to allow him time to find an attorney.Afterwards, standing on a noisy New York City street, Moncayo had no idea why three men in expensive black suits in a Lincoln town car were driving away with his laptop, which they kept for 14 hours. On the laptop were photos of his children and wife. This high-drama tactic produced nothing for Chevron, except a story that Moncayo will never forget and will repeat over and over again. His parting words at the airport were, \"I will never step foot in this country again.\"Not one reporter covering the trial wrote about what happened to Moncayo.\u2022 Some did write, however, about what the former Ecuador judge who wrote the $9 billion judgment was wearing to keep warm in a courtroom so cold even hardy New Yorkers were shivering. The former judge, Nicholas Zambrano, traveled voluntarily from Ecuador to Kaplan's courtroom to defend against Chevron's baseless allegation that he accepted a bribe. Zambrano also received an unceremonious welcome: Kaplan allowed Mastro to berate him after he creepily promised a \"warm New York welcome\".Mastro literally gave Zambrano a trick pop quiz about his ruling on the stand. To keep warm on the second day of his testimony, Zambrano wore a wool cap, a scarf and gloves. One reporter described his attire and testimony as \"bizarre\" and headlined his article, \"Attempt to Rehabilitate Chevron Judge Gets Very Weird.\"It is possible that Judge Zambrano was making a \"fashion statement\" of his own to tell Kaplan what he really thinks of the idea of a New York judge serving as a self-appointed arbiter of a foreign nation's judicial rulings. But the American reporters didn't see it that way. Instead, they wrote about how Zambrano could not answer some of Mastro's trick questions in the pop quiz. Little did they know that Kaplan - who has never been to Ecuador and certainly would never go there to appear in a trial to defend one of his rulings - dismissed the pop quiz in a side bar with just the attorneys present. In an apparent defense of Zambrano, Kaplan remarked that even the highly-regarded U.S. Judges Benjamin Cardozo and Learned Hand would not be able to remember details of a three-year-old decision.\u2022 While reporters focused on the pop quiz and Zambrano's attire, another former Ecuador judge (Alberto Guerra) to whom Chevron paid huge sums to turn on Zambrano got on and off the witness stand relatively unscathed -- at least in the eyes of Kaplan and most reporters. In fact, nobody covering the trial detailed how Guerra testified that he changed his story about the alleged bribe three times to get Chevron to pay him more money and agree to move his entire family to the United States. Chevron has entered into a contract with Guerra that provides him with at least $350,000 over two years in exchange for favorable testimony. Chevron also has an option to continue the \"funding relationship\" indefinitely. Questions raised about faked deposit slips Guerra submitted as evidence were just not as interesting as Zambrano's wool cap.   Of course, what is really weird and bizarre is that the Ecuadorians sought to have the New York court hear the trial when the case originally was filed in 1993, but the court sent them packing back to Ecuador. A different U.S. trial judge concluded in 2001 that the courts in Ecuador were sufficiently independent and fair, and more than capable of hearing the case. Gomez, in his final brief to the court, captured this sad irony:\"When the Amazon communities came here many years ago seeking justice, this Court was eager to expel them from New York--it tried to do so once and was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, then managed to dispense with them more permanently the second time around. With no regard for this history, this Court now appears determined to maintain a death-grip on these Ecuadorian citizens, and to make itself the global, authoritative voice in this dispute.\"This Court has locked the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs into this case to this point by giving Chevron every benefit of every doubt even when there has been no good reason to do so, and, at times, by finding uncertainty in the law where none really exists. In so doing, the Court has forced the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to expend massive resources here that likely otherwise would have been allocated to attempting to enforce the judgment that it took them eighteen years to win--one of Chevron's obvious main objectives in filing this blunt instrument of a lawsuit....\"In the opening of his final brief on behalf of the Ecuadorians, Gomez aptly wrote: \"The United States courts have failed the Ecuadorian Amazon communities.\"Within the next two months Kaplan is expected to issue his opinion. In the eyes of the Ecuadorians that is all it will be - his opinion and, an arrogant one, at that._____Disclosure: I work pro-bono for a group of indigenous Ecuadorians and their U.S. legal adviser, Steven Donziger, to help hold Chevron accountable for one of the world's largest environmental disasters in the Amazon rainforest. From May 2008 to March 2013, I was paid by Donziger to represent the Ecuadorians as their U.S. media spokesperson."}, {"title": "Collaboration, Not Heros, Drives Shifts in Climate Change", "text": "When I heard in late December that Bill McKibben had written another article for Rolling Stone, I was thrilled. His July 2012 piece for that publication -- \"Global Warming's Terrifying Math\" -- started a firestorm. McKibben had determined that the public was losing interest in battling climate change because there was no clear enemy. With no titanic force to battle, consumers had no one to blame but themselves, and that notion was driving away supporters. Then McKibben's article identified the fossil fuel companies as the once and future evil, and because of horrors such as the Exxon Valdez and BP's Gulf Oil Spill, they were bad guys we already loved to hate.  McKibben gave us our powerful, venal villains. But a perfect story needs a hero too. McKibben's article's title, \"Obama and Climate Change: The Real Story,\" made it seem like that hero might be Obama.  But McKibbens' article turned out to be an indictment, using Obama's own words to brand him the President who has done more harm to the environment than even his predecessor, former oil man George W. Bush:Here's Obama speaking in Cushing, Oklahoma, last year...It is to energy what Mitt Romney's secretly taped talk about the 47 percent was to inequality. Except that Obama was out in public, boasting for all the world to hear:  'Over the last three years, I've directed my administration to open up millions of acres for gas and oil exploration across 23 different states. We're opening up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources offshore. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the Earth, and then some... In fact, the problem . . . is that we're actually producing so much oil and gas... that we don't have enough pipeline capacity to transport all of it where it needs to go.''With Obama so squarely reduced to a fossil fuel promoter, is there any good news anywhere about climate change as we enter 2014?  I had high hopes reading USA Today's energy reporter Wendy Koch 's \"Technology Can Halt Climate Change.\" Koch starts by comparing global warming to the 1890s horse manure crisis. That crisis was solved when a \"shift happened\" -- the automobile was adopted virtually overnight. Koch offers examples of possible solutions to climate change now in the works: high-altitude wind kites, \"plug and play\" nuclear reactors, giant synthetic trees to absorb carbon dioxide, sulfate aerosols to cool the planet, hydrogen fuel-cell car and mass market hybrids.  None of these potential solutions carries even the remotest possibility of quick, widespread adoption.  But amidst all the gloom, there is one old idea that just last week seemed to be everywhere again, Ms. Koch's technology predictions aside: that much maligned force of nature, solar.  Everyone prefers a transition strategy to one that disrupts our lives or limits our choices. The electric car that has a reasonable range has been one such strategy. Tesla, the first car to do that, runs on enormous batteries that have to be replaced every seven years at a cost of $20,000. Such a drawback for buyers seems to cry out for a solar solution, but it's impossible to run a car on today's solar panels. Toyota's panels generate only enough to run a car's ventilation system.  Tesla's founder Elon Musk also founded SolarCity so naturally the companies collaborated on a solution. Rather than working on better solar panels for cars, SolarCity uses Tesla's batteries first in refrigerator-sized units for commercial buildings, and eventually in smaller batteries for home solar applications, solving the problem of what happens when the sun isn't shining.  Ironically, Ford has the hottest idea for a solar-powered car. As reported in MIT Technology Review, its self-driving C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid will recharge from solar panels atop a carport roof equipped with a special flat lens. The lens will concentrate enough solar energy to recharge the car in six hours and store it in batteries made by SunPower.  Mash it all together -- driverless cars developed by Google (a version of which was recently built for $4,000 by one of Time Magazine's Influential Teens), solar powered carports, battery technology developed for the electric car applied to buildings (could power plants be next?), distributed energy produced by better roof panels and batteries for local storage -- and you start to get excited again. It's not a single hero or a single technology but a collaboration rooted in a natural energy source that comes closest to pushing the shift.  Finally, as reported on the front page of Saturday's New York Times, \"Solar Power Craze on Wall St. Propels Start-Up,\" referring to SolarCity. So on top of the technology, the hot entrepreneurs, the brainiac kids and the eagerness to collaborate, the money is there too. Now that's a shift happening!"}, {"title": "Top New 2014 Baby Names for Environmentalists", "text": "I've been noticing that everyone is coming up with lists for the New Year.

The alligator was near the edge of extinction not that long ago. Now, they are everywhere in the warmer areas of the American South. If the name is too much for him as he gets older, he can go by Al. But what guy wouldn't want to be named Alligator? 2. Carb\u00f3n.  I like the Latin sound of this. Say it loud and with authority and you'll see what I mean. Anyone with this name is likely to be a future green CEO. 3. Coal.  I have some Coles in my family. Just change a couple of letters and your son could be named after one of the major sources of greenhouse gases on the planet. It is a super masculine name. He'll be an environmental geologist. 4. ENSO.  For the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. It's a great name for anyone with Italian heritage. 5.Freon .  This is the name given by DuPont for their halocarbon refrigerants. Many new Freon products are not ozone depleting. Plus Freon is a classy sounding name.  6.LEED  The US Green Building Council rates buildings based on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design system known as LEED. If you can build a LEED platinum building, why not name the platinum child you made LEED? 7. Leopold. After Aldo Leopold, the author of A Sand County Almanac and the father of environmental ethics. I didn't go with Aldo because it sounds too old fashioned.  8. Local.  Everyone is getting on the locavore bandwagon. Why not join the trend and solidify your relationship to food by naming your son Local?  9. MO.  Short for GMO. I supposed you could name him GMO and tell people that the G is silent like Gnu.  10. Volt. Volt sounds like the name of a major soap opera heartthrob and is also an electric car. What's not to love about Volt?Best wishes for a pleasant 2014 as you welcome your little Alligator, Prairie, Volt, or Carson."}, {"title": "Humongous Waves Hit The Coast Of Portugal (VIDEO)", "text": "While the eastern United States deals with a chilling winter front, the western coast of Portugal is experiencing some monster ocean waves.On January 6, a Reddit user captured massive waves that were reportedly 23 meters (or 75 feet) tall hitting Praia do Norte near the city of Nazar\u00e9 on the coast of Portugal.This coast is not an unpopular place for massive waves.

Here are the extraordinary people and ideas changing the world this week:Earlier this year environmentalist Todd Lehman founded EnviroHub, an all-volunteer effort to curate materials and create a central location for science writing and environmental literacy resources. Since then, Todd and his team has partnered with several other environmental websites to offer content on critical issues like climate change, resource use, and population dynamics. The site also offers more than 170 scientific articles from the Environmental Literacy Council and as a result, EnviroHub is already one of the most comprehensive online collections of environmental science research.English teacher, activist, and multimedia artist Neal Sehgal is founder of the grassroots advocacy group Evolve For Animals. Unlike other organizations in the animal advocacy movement, Evolve for Animals promotes veganism in terms of lifestyle, not just diet, and animal exploitation in terms of use, not just abuse. Their approach includes leafleting, tabling, public speaking engagements, film screenings, and other tactics particularly aimed at reaching college students and the 18-25 age group.Trista Hendren is the author of The Girl God Book, a children's book that celebrates the Divine Feminine. Trista is working on her second children's book, The Mother Earth Book, a loving tribute to Mother Earth and a call to action for children, their parents and grandparents. The book will include illustrations by renowned Norwegian artist Elisabeth Slettnes as well as inspiring quotes from Vandana Shiva, Alice Walker, Winona LaDuke, Jane Goodall, Raffi Cavoukian, Arundhati Roy and many more. \"We must drastically change the world on so many levels: war, poverty, global warming, rape, violence against women, sexual and other forms of slavery,\" said Trista. \"The best place to start is at the beginning, where humans are the most open.\"Julia Metzger-Traber and Davide De Lillis are dance and performance artists who are passionate about collaborative, creative work with international participants. They are currently planning a workshop for the youth residents of the Hanoi Vietnam Village of Friendship, a healthcare provider for more than 100 children and 40 adults with a variety of mental and physical conditions, many a result of Agent Orange exposure. Julia first became interested in this community working with the film Lighter Than Orange, a documentary on some of the four million Vietnamese veterans who have been victims of Agent Orange. Julia and Davide intend the workshop to facilitate and communicate a love for these residents' unique bodies, regardless of normative shape or abilities, and have partnered with The University of Fine Arts, Hanoi, and the Berlin Technical College of Design.Mother Nature is a movement of nature activists and Buddhist monks fighting for environmental justice in Cambodia. Led by Alex Gonzalez-Davidson, Somnang Sim, Heng Meng, and Ven Lek, Mother Nature is working on a campaign to preserve the Areng Valley, one of Cambodia's most important biological hotspots and home to the Khmer Daeum indigenous groups. Their work aims to stop a proposed hydro dam that would obliterate this incredible biodiversity and obliterate the livelihoods of the 1500 people currently living in the area.Monica Mueller and Bryn Merrell are a power duo of passionate cinematographers, artists, social entrepreneurs, and storytellers. They founded the online boutique Artful Venture to help artisans in Ecuador reach an international audience, help the artisans support themselves, and create a personal connection between the consumer and the creator. A percentage of each sale supports Arte del Mundo, a non-profit free afterschool program that provides literacy and arts classes for the children of Ba\u00f1os, Ecuador.Earth Science teacher and geospatial technology expert Alex Chaucer created Geocreds, an innovative digital badge-based website, to encourage higher-education students to gain greater knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS) and technology skills. Alex believes these key educational foundations, along with critical thinking skills, are essential to addressing problems like climate change and increased environmental disasters. \"We live in a changing world and students are not getting the education they need,\" he said. \"I see a great need for leadership in getting our youth and professionals the right access to geography and GIS education.\"Congratulations to our grantees this week for their outstanding work.These are just a few examples of what a little seed money can do when put in the hands of someone with a vision and a plan to change the world.If you were given $1000, how would YOU seed the change?The Pollination Project makes $1000 grants every day, 365 days a year to individual changemakers.

Those included parts of health care reform, clean water protections and pollution limits.The rules were sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), a division of the Office of Management and Budget within the White House, which is meant to review the rules from various federal agencies. But many of them languished at the office beyond the maximum of 90 days the office has to review them.In the letter, which was also sent to the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the coalition pushes for change in the office. While there have been some \"laudable\" improvements recently, \"we believe that there remain substantial procedural and process issues with respect to the transparency and effectiveness of OIRA\u2019s involvement in the regulatory review process that require fundamental reform,\" wrote coalition co-chairs Katherine McFate, president and CEO of the Center for Effective Government, and Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen.The letter continues:We urge you to direct OIRA to accelerate efforts to reduce the regulatory review backlog and prioritize timeliness in reviews going forward. We ask you to confirm whether or not OIRA is continuing the recent practice of requiring agencies to get permission to submit individual rules for review, and if the policy is continuing, to direct OIRA to cease it. Further, more comprehensive reforms are needed to correct the systematic delay, opacity and politicization that have been pervasive issues in the OIRA review process."}, {"title": "Holy Icebergs! A Warmer, Thirstier Future on Tap", "text": "If you've spent the past few days battling the polar vortex, it might be hard to wrap your head around the idea that the freezing weather was actually caused by warming temperatures. But wait, there's more: The same global warming that sent arctic weather our way will also lead to massive water shortages in the not-so-distant future.A group of researchers from 12 countries recently released a report predicting that an increase of just 2 degrees Celsius in global temperatures above present levels could leave one-fifth of the world's population thirsty. On the list of the most at-risk regions for severe water scarcity: the southern United States.A couple days ago, The New York Times published an article on the Colorado River that started with the sobering statistic that the once-mighty river of the Southwest has suffered \"14 years of drought nearly unrivaled in 1,250 years.\"Seven states rely on the Colorado River for water. An Interior Department report released in 2012 projected that the population served by the Colorado could nearly double in the next 50 years, from 40 million to 76.5 million people. With rising temperatures and demand already exceeding supply, the river won't be able to keep up. Facing the reality of water shortage scenarios, Nevada official John Entsminger told The New York Times, \"It sure looks like in the 21st century, we're all going to have to use less water.\"The Colorado River isn't the only stressed watershed in the region. Southern California's Santa Ana River Watershed was the topic of a 2013 Interior Department report. According to the agency, the future's looking a bit dry there, too, as human population, agricultural and industry demands keep growing at the same time climate change is diminishing the supply side. A river just can't catch a break these days.Back to that 2 degree increase that'll cause water shortages for one-fifth of the world. Based on our current track record, it could happen as soon as mid-century -- around the same time the global population is pushing nearly 10 billion people.So, how do we stop this?Suggestions from the Interior Department's 2012 Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study included \"wrapping large water bags around icebergs in the Alaska region and using tug boats to transport the frozen water to a port along the coast of Southern California.\"Icebergs.Or we could focus on reducing emissions, conserving water and stabilizing population growth so we can have a healthier planet where people and wildlife thrive.Climate change, overconsumption and population growth need to be more than just bullet points buried in policy reports. These issues need to be the policies.We need to drastically cut back on water and energy intensive systems, like raising livestock for food. And instead of continuing the trend of unprecedented attacks on reproductive rights in the U.S., we need to increase access to contraception and family planning. Watershed management plans should go beyond simply meeting the needs of ever-growing human populations to actually enhance the watershed's habitat and provide a healthier ecosystem for the people and wildlife relying on it.And maybe, if we place our bets on confronting global warming and population growth, we can give rivers, wildlife and us a chance."}, {"title": "Water Is the Enemy, Gatorade Mobile Game Tells Youth", "text": "If you thought Big Soda's decades-long \"War on Water\" -- part of their strategy to increase sales of soda and other bottled drinks -- couldn't get any worse, you were wrong. The latest assault, courtesy of PepsiCo, is in the form of a mobile game for youth that brands water as the enemy of athletic performance.According to a case study video posted on the 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau MIXX Awards Winners Gallery, bronze award-winner Gatorade took action after learning that teen athletes often choose \"to drink water during practice because they thought it provided the proper hydration they needed.\"Of course, for all but a minute percentage of youth athletic endeavors (such as a marathon or all-day soccer tournament) water is the ideal choice for proper hydration, but that didn't faze sugary drink brand Gatorade one bit. In an effort to change hearts and minds, as well as further increase parent company PepsiCo's enormous profits, Gatorade brand managers asked media agency OMD to drive home the following message to youth athletes: Gatorade is superior to water.The case study video goes on to describe how OMD responded cleverly, integrating Gatorade's new anti-water message into an existing Gatorade-sponsored mobile game, called Bolt!:We came up with an entertaining and competitive way to reinforce to teens that consuming Gatorade would help them perform better on the field and that water was the enemy of performance.The objective of OMD's newly created integrated game, released in the U.S. in April, 2013, \"was to maneuver Usain's character through a course in the fastest time possible, gathering Gatorade along the way to make him go faster and avoiding drops of water that slow him down.\" That's a pretty clear message PepsiCo is sending to kids and teens-drink \"hero\" Gatorade if you want to perform at your peak as an athlete, like Olympian Usain Bolt. But drink the \"enemy\" water and your performance will suffer.Not surprisingly, the mobile game campaign to brand water as the enemy was a rip-roaring success. According to the video, Gatorade attracted four million online fans and \"a network of influential celebrities to generate buzz around the game, including Usain himself, Troy Polamalu, and Justin Bieber.\" The game has had 2.3 million downloads and has been played 87 million times. The majority of players (73 percent) fall within Gatorade's key demographic segment of 13-to-24 years old. However impressive those numbers are, the most impressive number to Gatorade is this:More importantly though, the 820 million brand impressions generated, drove home the message that Gatorade helps you perform better than water.If anyone was still harboring hopes that Big Soda was really interested in helping First Lady Michelle Obama increase water consumption through her Drink Up Campaign, this latest attack on water should burst that bubble.To briefly recap, Big Soda's War on Water has so far also included:The next obvious question is what else is Big Soda doing to quash consumer water consumption, and damage the First Lady's Drink Up campaign, that we have yet to discover?

Since then, thousands of buildings in the United States have earned LEED accreditation from LEED-Silver and Gold to a LEED-Platinum rating.In the mid 1980s, Steven Winter was an advocate of sustainability. At that time, his voice fell on deaf ears. He recounted that story in the honoree acceptance speech at the Urban Green Council's most important fundraiser that \"supports our critical education, advocacy, and research initiatives.\"For a LEED-Gold project like the Riverhouse (2005-2008) it was a major undertaking for all stakeholders involved. The three architects, many engineering and construction firms all had to be ramped up on the LEED movement. There was the Steven Winter Associates' team to give project personnel and I an education on what sustainability meant in the urban green setting.Catching up with Steve Winters On the initial attempt to develop the green building program: \"It was not really my idea, but that of several conservation-minded architects,\" he said. \"The concept was developed by some dedicated individuals like Bob Berkebile, Harry Gordon, Greg Franta and others who started out as the American Institute of Architects' Energy Committee, which later became its Committee on the Environment (COTE). COTE is now as much respected by the AIA and is influential within the building industry.\" Steven Winter added, \"But 30 years ago the AIA's senior officers decided that green issues weren't important and defunded the old committee, effectively killing its ambition and missing the opportunity for AIA to lead the sustainability charge.\"Beyond the old guard not seeing the light, Mr. Winter wrote via email: \"The earliest obstacles were credibility and buy-in by industry professionals. But starting around 2000 the whole movement took off like a rocket and players from all parts of the building industry jumped aboard in droves, with energy, time and money. During my tenure as Chairman, membership went from about 150 companies to about 2,500, and later to about 25,000.\" Steven Winter has also taught at Columbia University and the Pratt Institute.\"How can technology augment the next evolutionary phase of sustainability on building projects?\" I asked.\"There are enormous strides being made on building energy performance feedback with smart sensors and remote/automatic data gathering devices, allowing us to gather feedback on the results of our building improvement initiatives. Our onsite inspection and testing work can be recorded and reported simultaneously,\" he answered.That's a big improvement for a paper-intensive industry that has lagged far behind fifteen other verticals when it comes to investing in technology, according to a McGraw-Hill 2012 report.\"Today, big data is allowing us to make more accurate predictions about future energy and sustainability performance based on data gathered from past performance. This gives designers confidence in building models, and it gives lenders the basis for financing predicted future savings,\" Steven Winter stated.The 'body of knowledge,' which has long been lacking in the industry, too, is coming to the fore: how to gather, disseminate, and leverage historical data on projects of scale and complexity?For someone with 25+ years in the engineering-construction industry, I have seen, known, and experienced firsthand where at the end of projects, regardless of size, data goes to die. Once a project was over, the records were mothballed, in what architects called \"dead files,\" unless a defect would arise later and turn into a claim or court case. Today, technology is allowing designers to not only model, but to design and implement systems from similar projects built in the past.Another Green Advocate A week after the Urban Green Gala, I took a tour of Brookhaven National Laboratory on behalf of Livingston Securities and sat next to another \"green\" architect Gene Stern. He got involved with the urban green movement in 2000. And his view on sustainability supported that of Steven Winters.\"At the time, we thought buildings were being built with no concern to how it impacts the usage of energy, usage of raw materials, and usage of water,\" Gene Stern said. \"I knew that many buildings would last for a generation, but its impact would last for many generations.\"That insight echoed the sentiments of the USGBC, which, he said, was created by concerned individuals trying to make an impact and change the way buildings would be built in the future.\"The USGBC realized that we had to have local representation to affect a sea change. Back then, local chapters were formed; the first was in New York City. Although I worked in NYC, I lived on Long Island and along with five or six people, was a founder of the chapter there. Long Island already had issues of population growth, brownfields, and over development (i.e., farmland turned to subdivisions), with less open space,\" he said. \"Our founding group started at Brookhaven National Labs and put together a committee that led the foundation of USGBC-LI, chapter. Our group along with others across the USA created the scorecard system to evaluate buildings both new and existing. That was the beginning of the LEED.\"\"How has the LEED movement grown since you were involved?\" I asked.\"It has been eye opening for me. We had this national meeting of a few hundred people to conventions that had 40,000 visitors. Greenbuild started in 2002. It morphed into the premier sustainability conference in the world bringing architects, engineers, designers, manufacturers, government, environmentalists, developers, real estate professionals, academia, students and media together,\" he said with zeal. \"When President Clinton spoke at the Chicago Greenbuild I was amazed at how far we came. We changed the perceptions of professionals and non-professionals in the real estate market.\"\"What trends in green are taking place?\"Gene Stern said: \"The LEED rating system has undergone continual evolution. We have just instituted LEED V4 this year. We look at a changing landscape with new technologies, new materials, and new systems as an example and try to make changes to LEED to design better buildings now and in the future. There is third party evaluation process that proves what is stated by material and product manufacturers, allowing assurances that we will have better sustainable buildings.\"The ultimate goal of LEED focuses on quality of living standards, as well as using less energy and lower resource consumption, which gets aimed at \"reducing each building's carbon footprint,\" Stern concluded.Challenges for LEED in the Future Peering ahead, the sage of sustainability Steven Winter sees threats and challenges:\"LEED has competition and will get even more of it: other green rating systems that are less expensive, less restrictive,\" he wrote, are going to shake up the industry. But can less quality be transformative as the initial launch of the LEED movement?\"Building codes are catching up with green standards. In the future, LEED may become redundant because its criteria will be required by codes,\" he stated, noting two final challenges:\"LEED is under fire by some industries threatened by it, like the timber and chemical industries. They are applying political and public relations pressure that threaten its success and even its survival.\"LEED certification is time consuming and expensive, and its benefits are not universally recognized. Its proponents must make persuasive business cases to ensure its acceptance and expansion.\"On the final point, the paper-intensive industry, which is timber-related, needs to adopt more cloud computing, among other tech solutions. Less, streamlined data shared by all will make the road to LEED certification \"less time consuming and expensive.\"In that case, less will be more."}, {"title": "Reasons for Optimism on Climate Action", "text": "Climate champions, think how bad things were this time three years ago.Copenhagen's failure in 2009 still stung. The U.S. Senate hadn't even mustered a vote on its version of Waxman Markey. Numerous leadership states were moving backward on climate after the November 2010 midterms. The Obama Administration seemed poised to permit the Keystone XL Pipeline. And worst of all, after the failures of 2009-10 and the phony East Anglia climate-gate brouhaha, mere mention of climate change had become toxic politically. With no one naming it, climate had all but vaporized as an issue in the U.S.Fast forward to today and the picture has changed considerably.First off, U.S., greenhouse gas emissions are declining. They are 12 percent below 2005 levels, and national emissions have fallen every year since 2008.As a result, the U.S. is within striking distance of President Obama's 2009 pledge to reduce emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels.The downturn in emissions means there is a decent chance that the U.S. will arrive in Paris for the next major international climate conference at the end of 2015 on track to fulfilling its reductions commitment, a pole position that should give Obama considerable leadership chops with other heads of state.Some of the reduction in emissions has been the result of the downturn in the economy, but it's the other reasons that are especially interesting.Coal. The single biggest drop in U.S. emissions has come from the decline in coal fired electricity generation, which has gone from 50 to 39 percent in the last four years -- a nearly 25 percent decline.This has resulted in part from a remarkable display of grassroots muscle-flexing by the Sierra Club and tens of other regional and local groups, who have successfully argued that 180 planned coal plants should not be built, and that 158 existing plants (a third of the coal fleet in 2010) should be shut down. By 2020, experts predict, coal based electricity will decline further to about a quarter of the U.S. electricity fuel mix.Low cost natural gas has been a critical ally in all of this. With additional costs on coal-based power generation coming in the form of new EPA regulations, utilities have made business decisions all across the country that gas plants will be less risky and cheaper to run for base load power.Gas plants emit about half what coal plants do. Assuming that methane from fracking and leaks can be kept under control (still unclear), this can be a major benefit to the atmosphere.Buildings. Less well known, but potentially even more important, buildings in the U.S. are becoming much more energy efficient, and future trends look promising.The Energy Information Agency, which tracks U.S. emissions, has revised downward its curve of anticipated energy use by U.S. buildings every year since 2005. The EIA calculates that anticipated energy use in 2030 could be 40 percent lower in the U.S. than was anticipated in 2005.This is a big deal. What's going on?There is a joke that when economists walking down the street see $100 bills lying around, they won't pick them up because if they were real, someone would have already picked them up.It turns out that the private sector has been figuring out that there really are a lot of $100 bills lying around and many of the more enlightened are busy collecting them. Manufacturers, for instance, have learned they can save money by building cleaner assembly lines and by retrofitting old plants. This makes their products more economically competitive. More commercial building owners are also learning to save money by being energy efficient. And developers, and architects around the country are adopting advanced designs for cleaner buildings that their clients are seeking out more frequently.The change rippling through the building sector is nothing short of remarkable and it is a largely untold story. A lot of this is the result of decades of federal, state, and local policies on energy efficiency that have begun to kick in. As a result, the gigantic U.S. fleet of millions of buildings is collectively beginning to alter course and become cleaner.It is illuminating to realize that these declines in energy use are being driven by leadership fractions of owners and developers who are out ahead of policy because of the economic benefits of moving faster. As policy catches up and helps everyone else learn how to take advantage of these savings opportunities, the building sector will become cleaner and cleaner in coming years.On the horizon of this movement is a new class of net zero energy buildings that generate at least as much energy as they consume. Developers like KB Homes have been building them in multiple states during the past several years. Experts estimate that more than two hundred of these net zero energy buildings have been built in the U.S. during the past five years.Within a few more years, many thousands of these buildings will be coming on line. California is requiring that all new residential buildings be net zero emissions by 2020 and that all commercial buildings be net zero by 2030. Net zero buildings will surely catalyze another wave of revolution in building efficiency. A group called Architecture 2030 has just released an online catalogue of materials that builders will need to construct these buildings. Inevitably more and more buildings in other parts of the country will begin incorporating these materials as well.States other than California are enacting tax credits to create incentives for net zero buildings. Just think what this could mean in 10 years if more states adopt these rules and standards. It is easy to think automatically that a net zero home is some kind of distant futuristic and expensive fantasy, but these building are being built now and developers like KB Homes say there is only about a small cost increment. Tax and other incentives could easily close that gap.States and cities are also learning how to finance energy retrofits of existing buildings, a key need if demand for retrofits is to increase. State and local officials are doing this by encouraging policies that allow energy retrofit financing through property and utility bills. By the end of 2013 $56 million in funded projects will have run through Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) finance systems to upgrade windows, appliances, lights and insulation in commercial and residential buildings, and another $215 million in PACE project applications have been filed. Up front capital comes from lenders and other sources. Debt service payments do not exceed monthly energy savings so there is no noticeable cost to the bill payer. As this market grows, banks see a business opportunity to make hundreds of thousands of small loans with almost no risk.Thirty-one states have enacted PACE policies to finance commercial building retrofits, and a growing number of states and localities are working to take the same approach with residential properties. When these systems are up and running across the country, private and public actors will be working together to wring energy savings out of all kinds of buildings all across the country, saving billions of dollars and reducing emissions.The U.S. Department of Agriculture offers a program backed by federal dollars that helps rural households and businesses finance energy efficiency upgrades through their local Rural Electric Cooperative (REC) electricity bills. Rural homes and buildings are some of the least efficient buildings in the country. These are typically also lower income communities where these savings can make an enormous difference. As these programs proliferate across the country through the REC community, there is no good reason why larger investor owned utilities can't develop on-bill finance programs as well.What's also striking about the building retrofit marketplace is that it is truly bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats both see the value of using energy more efficiently, saving money, and generating jobs to get the work done. Enlightened bankers are eager to see this industry scale so they can more easily finance it. The only real opponents are the Koch Brothers and their ilk who want to sell more not less energy to customers no matter the consequences to the planet or peoples' pocket books.Vehicles. A remarkable, long awaited technological evolution is also powering energy saving opportunities in the vehicle sector. Obama Administration rules enacted during the President's first term mean that average fleet fuel efficiency in passenger cars is increasing from 29.7 miles per gallon to 54.5 mpg. This is a near doubling that will almost halve average energy use in passenger vehicles, saving consumers billions in fuel costs. To meet these requirements, eight automobile companies have 14 electric vehicles available in the U.S. market. Sales of these vehicles doubled in 2013. Market share is still tiny relative to overall purchases, but there is growing excitement about these vehicles, and all levels of government are working to ease their way onto the roads.Eastern states and western states, for instance, are crafting interconnected highway systems where drivers are assured of finding charging stations that can power their vehicles along trips hundreds of miles long.Eight states recently joined together to develop policy approaches to creating incentives for zero emission vehicles. This will create a large market place with harmonized standards, allowing carmakers to maximize sales over a larger territory. We've seen this movie before. States take the lead, and then federal policy follows. There is now broad bipartisan recognition that these cars are GM's and Ford's future and that building them will bring jobs and investment to American workers and communities as well as savings at the gas pump, reduced air pollution and lower carbon emissions.Renewable energy use is also on the upswing in the U.S.Wind power development reached a new record in 2012 with 13,000 megawatts added in the U.S. and $25 billion invested. In 2013, a massive bipartisan coalition of business and political leaders successfully drove renewal of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) in Washington, D.C., but project development took a hit because of the uncertainty over the renewal process. The PTC will be up for renewal again in 2014. Hopefully federal lawmakers see the downside of stop and start policy, and will create a stable long term policy framework for the future.Solar also has had two breakout years in a row in the U.S. Installed solar more than doubled in the U.S. in 2012 to 7,000 megawatts, and will grow by its largest margin ever in 2013 to nearly 11,000 megawatts despite the low cost of natural gas for electricity. This is the kind of growth curve solar companies have been predicting for years. Driving the upsurge is a combination of cost reductions and new financing tools.The cost of panels has declined by 60 percent since the beginning of 2011. The cost of installing solar (getting it from a manufacturer to a roof) is also coming down as the market grows, though we still trail countries like Germany and Japan, who install solar much faster and more cheaply than we do here. The good news is that as installation costs decline, as they surely will, overall costs to the consumer will decline further as well, making solar even more competitive.We've also finally learned how to finance solar in the U.S., which is adding to affordability. Solar leases that take away up front installation costs in states with net metering rules like California have allowed residential solar installations to skyrocket. Some U.S. localities and states are also Americanizing a European finance approach by offering long term purchase contracts for the energy generated by solar systems. These long term contracts function like a power purchase agreement and allow homeowners and businesses to get a bank loan to buy their equipment. More than 2,000 megawatts of new demand for solar has been driven by these power purchase agreements in 23 jurisdictions in the U.S. over the last three years, with another 3,000 megawatts of commitments in the pipeline.Earlier this year, Minnesota passed a solar bill that incorporates a long term contract arrangement like this for 400 megawatts of new solar in the state. In that legislation, there is also a mandatory calculation that state electricity regulators will need to do that tabulates the other values of solar including health, job, and cost benefits. These benefits can then be used by the state's utilities to justify paying a little more for the solar power they purchase from homeowners and businesses that install solar, which will allow these small time generators to do more and larger installations cost effectively. The combination of a long-term contract and a new way of calculating how to value solar may be a model other states will be interested in adopting as well. If so, this model will contribute additional momentum to solar installation growth in the U.S.Utility 2.0. Seeing the onrush of new wind and solar onto the energy grid, forward looking utility companies are exploring new revenue models for the American electricity system that will keep them solvent, fund maintenance of the grid, and continue to encourage rapid growth in renewable generation. This conversation is conflicted, with a great many voices in the utility sector arguing that renewables will destabilize the U.S. electricity system. Change is always scary, but with more utility leaders now constructively engaging in how best to modify the system rather than just fighting the oncoming changes, there is a glimmer of hope that a rapid transition can be effected more easily. This so-called Utility 2.0 conversation bears watching closely.States and Cities. Governors and Mayors are also taking action. At the end of June, the Governors of California, Oregon, and Washington and the Premier of British Columbia announced that they intend to get the ball rolling on a Pacific Coast Collaborative clean energy market development program that will bring a million new jobs to the region and also reduce greenhouse emissions by 80 percent or more.At their October announcement, these leaders detailed a suite of market creation initiatives in the building, vehicle, and electricity sectors that will make the pacific coastal region increasingly competitive economically over coming decades. They are actively recruiting other states to join them in these efforts.In the wake of Super Storm Sandy, a growing chorus of mayors is also actively urging that cities prepare for oncoming climate change by making their cities more resilient to things like storms and sea level rise. Scores have developed \"resiliency\" plans. Seeing the extraordinary costs of preparing for climate, more mayors are also taking action to reduce emissions. New York City has helped lead this effort with a remarkable plan for protecting its infrastructure and communities, and it has also commissioned a study to examine how best to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, the level of commitment scientists say we must reach for. New York City is especially vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surge as it learned when Sandy walloped the city in October 2012. It knows it needs to set an achievable example for others to follow if the city is to survive. Other American and international cities are now working with the C40 Climate Leadership Group, which Mayor Bloomberg has helped support, to actively explore how they can achieve 80 percent, or better, levels of emissions reductions.Science. Super Storm Sandy has super charged the credibility of climate science. The science debate is in much better shape. The trumped up attacks of 2009 on the credibility of the science will not be possible during the next two years. Media is smarter and an array of groups is ready to counterpunch this time. The fifth IPCC report, due out in final this year, is expected to be more definitive on the human contribution to climate change, and the analysis of coming impacts will be even starker. We may finally have gotten past the point where a handful of deniers can muck up the global climate discussion.Public Opinion in the U.S., influenced by Super Storm Sandy and other extreme weather events, has also crystalized. A Gallup poll in March 2013 found that solar and wind power were the two top choices for domestic energy production, with 76 percent of respondents wanting more emphasis on solar and 71 percent wanting more wind energy. Surveys by the Yale Project on Climate Communications and George Mason University in April 2013 found that: 87 percent of Americans say the President and Congress should make the development of clean energy a high or very high priority; 70 percent say global warming should be a priority for the President and Congress; and 77 percent of people who identified themselves as Republicans or Republican-leaning Independents say the United States should use more renewable energy resources. 70 percent of those respondents want renewable energy use increased \"immediately\".Obama Climate Plan. The really big news in the U.S. on climate change, though, is President Obama's climate plan, announced last June at Georgetown University. In it the President promised a menu of actions he and his agencies can implement using executive authority.Most commented on in the sprawling Obama climate plan is the President's decision to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to finish rules for allowable carbon pollution from new power plants, and for allowable carbon emissions from existing power plants. These rules, long anticipated, will force utilities to either capture and store carbon emissions from their dirtiest power plants or shutter these facilities altogether. Of all the measures in the plan, these are the ones with the greatest impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Not surprisingly, they are also the most contentious, particularly the rule for existing plants. A massive fight will unfold over the next three years over these rules.The Obama climate plan also lays out several other big ticket actions in the U.S., including plans to increase energy efficiency in large trucks and trailers, complete a string of appliance efficiency standards that have been languishing at OMB, and reduce emissions of methane, which is an especially powerful greenhouse gas.Less commented on is the array of smaller actions the Obama plan is encouraging. Colorado State University estimates there are nearly 300 executive actions the Administration can take to accelerate investment in clean energy markets, encourage state and municipal action, and deepen federal agency action. If the Administration can implement a majority of these over the remainder of its term, it will set in motion a sense of inevitability about the clean energy future. Advocates can help encourage this sense of inevitability by not neglecting the smaller items in the Obama plan.In a nod to the growing anti-tar sands movement in the U.S., the President also signaled in his Georgetown speech that he was concerned that the Keystone XL pipeline might lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and that he would reject a permit for construction if it did. He seemed to have finally come around to the notion that his own legacy and the climate change problem broadly requires an aggressive approach that advances clean power sources and rejects dirty power. Advocates have their fingers crossed he will maintain this urgency. \"All of the above\" is not an acceptable strategy.The Obama climate plan also outlines a set of very ambitious international moves designed to reduce emissions globally.Most significant is the President's call for a virtual end to U.S. financial support for World Bank financed coal fired power plants. In the months since release of the plan, the Administration has backed up its intention by gathering a coalition of other nations, including the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom, who are each critical funders and board members of the World Bank. The European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the U.S. Export-Import Bank have each subsequently signaled that they too intend to join the effort to end coal finance. The U.S. and its European allies are now collectively reaching out to other nations including Germany and Japan and other multilateral and bilateral finance institutions to join this effort. A global coalition of environmental and development groups, who have been calling for just this kind of leadership, are rapidly mobilizing to support Obama's proposal with national level organizing in target countries.It is interesting to see that a parallel coal divestment effort in the non-governmental realm is also taking off. A recent Oxford University study found that a campaign to get investors to take their money out of the fossil fuel sector--which has had 41 institutions join since 2010--is the fastest-growing divestment drive ever.The Obama White House and State Department are also actively working with China and India to negotiate an agreement to prevent use of hydro fluorocarbons, known as HFCs. An HFC molecule is 1,000 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. President Obama and the new Chinese President Xi Jinping have had two constructive conversations on this topic, and the Obama Administration has also reached out to India, which is the other major manufacturer of these gases.At Copenhagen in 2009, one of the major impediments to success was the very public and highly contentious discussion between the U.S. and China on how best to reduce emissions. Signs are growing that the U.S. and China, who together emit 40 percent of all greenhouse gases, have developed a much improved working relationship. Intervention by the President and Secretary of State John Kerry, have made a big difference here. This relationship has to be robust if the globe is to achieve a serious result in Paris in 2015.Obama's and Kerry's activist approach on coal finance, HFC's, and relationship building with China has been heartening to international observers and diplomats working on climate change. It signals the beginning of a positive stance on climate negotiations by the U.S. at the beginning of the next two-year negotiation. If this positive trend continues, and it appears it will, this upcoming two year period will be the longest period with publicly constructive U.S. engagement on a climate negotiation in the 20-plus years these negotiations have been occurring.With this lengthy period of constructive engagement, it should be possible to think more constructively and creatively about a Paris agreement than has been true in past conference negotiations.Other developments from around the globe are also offering additional bits of confidence and hope as we enter this critical two-year period leading up to Paris.China. In China, air pollution from coal fired power plants has become a political vulnerability for the leadership and is driving a broad scale call for change. Coal plant emissions kill 1.2 million people a year in China, and are making millions more ill. As a result, Chinese leaders are actively seeking ways to clean the air. As recently as five years ago, Chinese officials regularly said Chinese carbon emissions would not peak until 2030. Recent health and political developments have led analysts at Citibank to conclude that Chinese coal emissions are likely to peak this decade. This is not fast enough to rescue the climate, but growing political urgency about public health impacts (along with faster than anticipated penetration of solar, wind, and energy efficiency) is clearly having an impact on the Chinese leadership. Given this new openness to a more rapid shift away from coal, many are hoping there are ways to cut coal use even faster in China.The pace of renewables development in China is one example of a faster than anticipated Chinese response. China built 10 thousand megawatts of new solar in 2013, and 12,000 megawatts are expected in 2014, much larger amounts than industry insiders anticipated even a year ago. Not only is China now the largest manufacturer and exporter of solar and wind equipment, it is now installing these technologies at home much faster than anyone else.China is also likely to be the fastest adopter of electric vehicles and it has clearly signaled that it is accelerating new and existing building efficiency measures as well.Global Renewables. The global renewables picture is also much more bullish than commonly recognized. The International Energy Agency in Paris reports that power generation from renewables will exceed natural gas and be twice what nuclear will be by 2016. It also says renewable energy is the fastest growing sector of the global power market and that it will be 25 percent of all energy generation worldwide by 2018. Wind and solar are powering this jump, the IEA says, doubling between 2011 and 2018.Saudi Arabia. One surprising example of the global renewables upsurge is happening in Saudi Arabia. The nation most synonymous with oil has decided to build 54,000 megawatts of new renewables for domestic energy consumption. The Saudis are losing massive amounts of potential revenue by using subsidized oil for domestic electricity. They'd much prefer selling that oil internationally at prevailing market prices of $100 a barrel or more. As a result, it's a no brainer for them to install solar and wind at a large scale to power their electricity grid.Germany aims to be at least 80 percent renewable by 2050. Already 25 percent of its electricity grid is renewable and despite warnings from many in the utility industry, its electricity system remains among the globes most reliable. Despite warnings that renewables would cause price spikes, wholesale energy prices in Germany are 50 percent lower than they were in 2008. This is because Germany's solar and wind power are eliminating peak prices during the day when the sun shines and at night when the wind blows. The savings for the country are enormous. As a result, Germany's competitiveness as a nation, as measured by the World Economic Forum, has climbed sixth to fourth globally in 2013. Retail prices for electricity in Germany are high, largely because of taxes added to the electricity bill, but they have remained stable (at about 2 percent) relative to household income for more than twenty years. The most recent coalition agreement between Chancellor Merkel and the Social Democrats calls for rebalancing electricity costs between industry and householders, but it is in no way a step back from the aggressive pro-renewables policy of the past ten years.In an interesting twist, rural areas of Germany have been a primary beneficiary of the country's aggressive renewable energy policy, and as a result, farmers and rural communities are the most passionate supporters of Germany's rapid march towards a renewable future. Half of all German renewables are in rural areas and these communities have realized significant economic rewards in the form of investment, income, and jobs.Germany's renewable energy law has also become a model for governments around the world. Nearly a hundred governments, including 20 European nations, China, India, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and a large number of regional and local governments worldwide, have enacted some version of what the German's call a Feed-in Tariff, which guarantees a long term price for renewable energy production as well as an automatic interconnect with the grid. With these two things in hand, project developers are able to secure a bank loan to finance equipment purchases. The law and these provisions have proven that a rapid shift to renewables is feasible and can be economically beneficial. There are lessons here for the U.S.Investment Climate. In part thanks to a vibrant policy environment globally on renewables, vehicles and buildings, the clean energy investment picture is positive. Despite a small dip in clean energy investment last year, Pew notes that clean energy investment in 2012 was five times what it was in 2004. Bloomberg New Energy Finance says investment needs to double from these levels if we want to start reducing global emissions by 2020. With governments strapped, private investment is going to need to cover the costs of the massive clean energy transition necessary to mitigate climate change. With multilateral finance institutions like the Word Bank looking as if they are about to become more serious about renewables, and with the declining price of solar, and a growing sense of urgency about climate change, the clean energy investment picture will improve, but will it be fast enough, and what else can we do to grow investment faster? If policymakers need to do one thing to assure potent climate change policy moving forward, it is assuring that the investment climate for clean energy stays strong globally. Perhaps nothing else is as important.What Now? We can't kid ourselves that smooth sailing lies ahead. Deep pocketed status quo-ers like the Kochs are eager to derail the clean energy future. They have a selfish interest in maintaining their fossil fuel businesses and they seem to be myopic in the extreme, but despite their best efforts, there is evidence of a shift occurring.Thinking back three years ago, it would have been hard to imagine there being as much opportunity as currently exists to make a meaningful difference on climate change.Building, vehicle, and electricity sectors are getting cleaner. Financial mechanisms and policy incentives are beginning to work in new and hopeful ways. Coal is showing signs of vulnerability at least in several important market places. Renewables are emergent globally and in multiple jurisdictions. Gas is much less of a drag on renewables than we expected. A citizen movement is coming to life in the U.S. on tar sands and divestment. For the first time, there is an American administration with a stated and proactive climate change policy. And China shows signs of being on a path to reducing its air pollution and related carbon emissions.It is an important moment. We are a long way from solving the climate problem, but threads of success seem to be coming together into something that resembles an opportunity that we need to find a way to seize and run with during the next two years.

Recently, it seems, the dolphin has even sought out human friends, often playing with surfers and swimmers -- whether they like it or not.\"She is an attention seeker,\" National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger Peter Bergman said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. \"She goes out of her way to swim with people. She will come right up to them.\"The bottlenose dolphin, who is distinguished from others by a distinctive nick on her dorsal fin, has not strayed far from the New South Wales coast since she became separated from her pod in September 2012, according to reports. The dolphin was left by herself after she became trapped in the Sussex Inlet. Rangers stepped in to help the dolphin, but the wild animal apparently never returned to her pod.After several months, wildlife services decided to intervene again for fear that the dolphin had become too tame and accustomed to humans. A video posted to YouTube in May 2013 shows rangers catching and releasing the dolphin into the open ocean.However, it seems the call of the sea was not strong enough to dissuade the dolphin from staying close to shore. In the past few weeks, the bottlenose dolphin has been spotted near several beaches along the southeastern coast of Australia, The Guardian reports.The dolphin's fondness toward humans -- while entertaining for beachgoers -- has wildlife experts worried.\"Although this dolphin does seem to actively seek out human interaction we are becoming more and more concerned about the number of people swimming with it at once, and of reports of people attempting to ride the animal, poke it and feed it,\" Sydney Harbour Area Manager Michael Treanor said in a statement Monday.\"Ultimately, if that happens the animal may need to be taken into captivity, which is not what anyone wants and what we have been working so hard to avoid,\" he continued.For the time being, the state's wildlife services are instructing swimmers to leave the dolphin alone -- even if she instigates interaction."}, {"title": "Haunting Photos Of Ice-Covered Buildings - Weather.com", "text": "A truck is covered in ice as firefighters help to extinguish a massive blaze at a vacant warehouse on Jan. 23,Read more on www.weather.com"}, {"title": "Brain Freeze: Why Climate Deniers Flail in a Cold Snap", "text": "With the precise predictability of an atomic clock, climate change deniers break out like a bad rash with irrational exuberance each time we see a snow flake. With the onset of winter's cold each year we can look forward to the reliable appearance of Skepticana deniacus, an increasingly popular bird of prey that feeds on ignorance and fear. With the regularity of a finely tuned pendulum, as soon as the temperature hits freezing this annoying species of fowl cries out with indignation that global warming must be a farce. After all, how could the world be warming if freezing temperatures are gripping most of the nation? Likewise, every winter we see newspaper editors across the country trot out the old and tired cartoon of the global warming group meeting cancelled due to snow and ice. Give me a minute here -- I'm doubled over in pain from the laughter.Whew. Now that we've recovered from that laugh riot, we can be sobered by the reality that newspaper editors and much of the general public all suffer from the common misunderstanding that weather and climate are equivalent. They are not. While the latest record cold snap brutalizing the country is nearly orgasmic for the flat earthers, their joy is sadly misplaced, a result of deep ignorance and faith-based science.Climate describes atmospheric behavior averaged over long time periods of decades and centuries across large geographic areas. Weather describes actual local atmospheric conditions over short periods of time, from hours to days. Weather is all about the actual state of the atmosphere with respect to wind, temperature, moisture, pressure, cloud cover and other instantaneous measurements. Climate is a composite of weather conditions averaged over many years. Think of weather as a single datum point and climate as a large collection of those data.Better yet, think of weather as a one-night stand. Then climate would be raising the kid resulting from that night for the next two decades. One immediately leads to the other, but the two are completely different phenomenon. And that is why we have two distinct fields of study: meteorology and climatology.The distinction between weather and climate becomes critical in understanding global warming. Let's look at what is happening right now. A persistent high pressure over the Arctic is acting like a big boulder in a fast moving river, causing the Jet Stream to flow south deep into the United States. With that big dip in the Jet Stream comes cold Arctic air. So we are all freezing our fannies off this week. But that has absolutely nothing to do with global warming. We can see catastrophic effects of climate change with an increase in average global temperature of just 2 to 3 degrees. If the arctic air warmed from -70 to -67 degrees, you would still freeze your buttocks off when that air blew south, but the impact on the global climate would nevertheless be profound over time. Weather is right now, the need to put on a thick winter coat to stop that cold arctic air from nipping off a limb from frost bite. Climate is the fact that the arctic air is warmer than expected, even if still cold enough to kill. Arctic air will always be brutally cold even in the most extreme cases of global warming. Snow and ice will always be a winter reality. So stop already with the embarrassing nonsense that climate change can't be real because it is cold outside. Nobody ever said climate change meant the end of winter. Grow up.Another favorite foul fowl from deniers is the old canard that global warming is nothing but a sign of natural variation in climate. That claim is fascinating on two levels. First, the idea implies that scientists themselves never thought of the idea that the earth's climate varied over the past 4 billion years. Hmmm. If they had only known, this one misunderstanding would have been cleared up. Second, and this one is steeped in irony, the deniers only know of such natural variation from the field of climatology and from climatologists. So deniers believe climatologists when they say there has been natural variation, while suggesting that those scientists actually never thought of such variation! One of the oddest twists of logic I've ever encountered.But I believe the real confusion between weather and climate derives from the fact that most of us have difficulties with the concepts of averages and trends. These are seemingly simple and self-evident ideas, but that simplicity is deceptive. How many of us remember from school the difference between average, mean and median? How many of us remember how to do a polynomial regression to uncover a trend? Averages and trends are not so simple after all -- but are critical if we are ever going to move beyond the silly idea that a cold winter means climate change is not real.But forget the math; let's take a hypothetical example instead. Let's say for the sake of discussion that in Austin, Texas, in 1990 the average winter low was 40 degrees and the average winter high was 60 degrees. Then in 1991 the averages were 40.1 degrees and 60.1 degrees, respectively. Would you feel any difference? Of course not. In fact, even if the average temperature was .1 degrees higher, you could still have record lows that year if you had a greater number of days above average. But sure enough as soon as that record low was recorded a denier would be on TV claiming global warming a hoax. Local record low temperatures are a weather phenomenon, not a climate issue. But in 10 years if that trend continued the new averages would be 41 and 61 degrees. In another 10 years the numbers would be 42 and 62. In just 30 years the average temperatures would have risen 3 degrees, an increase that climatologists agree would have catastrophic impacts. The weather would not be changing noticeably even as the trend was rising dangerously. So of course we will experience cold winters, with deep freezes, snow and ice and maybe even record lows. That weather has absolutely nothing to do with the reality of global warming.Finally, climate change does not mean that all places will warm at all times; quite the contrary. We can indeed expect many places to see colder and harsher winters, just as we will see more frequent and violent tropical storms. As the climate shifts, we get more extremes at both ends; that cold snap does not indicate warming is a liberal plot; only that weather and climate are not equivalent - and that averages and trends are not determined by single datum points.Now let us all go out and do some polynomial regressions. And please spare us the pain of another bad cartoon with global warming scientists huddled outside a room boarded up with a sign that says \"closed due to snow and ice.\" A 5-year-old might find that funny the first time... but this is too serious for juvenile humor to guide our policy decisions. Unfounded skepticism needs to go the way of the dodo bird so we can get on with the business of planning for the future."}, {"title": "Whale Shark In Hawaii Gets Up Close And Personal With Tourists (VIDEO)", "text": "On Jan. 2, off Hawaii island's Kona coast, a group of excited snorkelers came across a mild-mannered and curious whale shark. The resulting scene can only be described as a flash mob as the tourists wave, flash shakas, and awkwardly maneuver around the whale shark's slow-moving path.Whale shark sightings in Hawaii are very rare, so when dive master Keller Laros of Jack's Diving Locker and his crew spotted a group of tour boats surrounding the elusive creature, he quickly grabbed his camera and dove in.\"The whale shark itself was very curious and it approached divers and boats very closely,\" Laros told KHON. \"Everyone was careful not to harass or touch or tease the whale shark.\"Laros, who is also a co-founder of the non-profit, Manta Pacific Research Foundation, tried to identify the whale shark by free diving deep underneath it. He estimated the animal to be about 20 to 25 feet long, which is relatively small considering the species is the largest fish in the sea, usually reaching up to 40 feet or more in length.\"The whale shark lives a pretty solitary life by in large. ... So, all of a sudden, to have all these interesting things happen, the whale shark just seemed to be enjoying the company,\" Laros said.Aside from documenting the rare encounter, Laros wanted to make sure the observing snorkelers were treating the wild animal with respect. In the video, he can be heard reminding them not to touch the slow-moving fish. All of the snorkelers heeded Laros's advice, except for one diver who tried to grab the whale shark's dorsal fin.\"It's pretty much understood here that you don't touch, tease, harass, ride, any of the wild animals out here,\" Laros said. \"It's just a privilege to be in their presence and the whale shark is no exception.\""}, {"title": "Stunning Photo Of Frozen Lake Michigan Lighthouse Goes Viral, But All Is Not As It Seems", "text": "A stunning photograph of an ice-covered lighthouse on Lake Michigan spread like wildfire on Twitter Tuesday, as users wielded the snowy picture as proof of just how cold much of the nation has become this week.The polar vortex turned this lighthouse on Lake Michigan into an ice palace. pic.twitter.com/BIo6p5KL88It's a gorgeous photograph for sure, and Saint Joseph, Mich., where this shot was taken, is indeed frozen over -- according to Weather.com, temperatures dipped as low as 6 below zero in the city Monday  -- but, as BuzzFeed's Mike Hayes has pointed out, the photo isn't all it seems to be.The picture, taken by pro photographer John McCormick, was actually snapped on Jan. 23, 2013, Hayes explains.But does that mean that the Saint Joseph Lighthouse was spared the polar vortex's worst?

We rightfully lambaste dams, power lines, mining operations and drilling operations when these activities have the potential to damage ecologically sensitive areas. But sometimes we become so caught up in defending land that we forget about the vast, life-sustaining oceans covering three quarters of our planet.Environmentalists don't spend enough time on cruise ships, and frankly, some of us prefer not to. After all, who doesn't enjoy a good cruise? Nobody can be begrudged for enjoying all those midnight buffets, awesome comedians and bands, pool games, or towels folded to look like animals (my favorite!).Unfortunately, our oceans aren't having as much fun with this rapidly growing industry. Discharges and air emissions from cruise lines cause extreme damage to countless marine mammals, birds, coastal areas, and already-endangered coral reefs. Millions of gallons of \"gray water\" from showers, kitchens, and laundry are dumped directly into the ocean, as are innumerable forms of hazardous waste. The raw sewage, bilge water and extensive garbage generated by these ships do not help their \"green\" credentials either.It gets worse. According to the Daily Telegraph, cruise ships expel three times as much carbon dioxide as airplanes (!). In Hong Kong, they've been identified as the single greatest contributor to air pollution. U.S. cities like Savannah are rejecting plans for new cruise ship docks doe to concerns over pollution. Cruise ships may not be the only threat to our oceans and coastal communities, but they're low-hanging fruit. Defending the planet must take priority over upscale entertainment.To begin reforming this industry, look no further than Alaska. Thanks to a flawed permit process, the state's Department of Environmental Conservation has been allowing cruise ships to pump endless waste through its waterways. A recent court order is now challenging the government agency to answer a simple question: why not require ships to utilize the best available pollution treatment? It isn't the first time the Alaska DEC has been asked to review its lax discharge permit, so now they are being compelled to take the issue seriously by one of Alaska's Superior Courts.Alaska isn't Vegas... what happens in that state doesn't need to stay there. There's a lot to learn from this \"best practices\" model, and we need to promote it far and wide. Yes, permits should mandate that cruise lines use the most effective and accessible technologies for dealing with pollution, and there's no good reason for them to do otherwise. Limits should be set on contaminants (water and air) and regular reporting should be required like every other industry that operates in the US. Period.Reforming the cruise industry won't be smooth sailing, but it's an excellent first step toward preserving our marine ecosystems. Cruises are awesome, but so is an ocean brimming with life.

However, these cities\u2019 suburbs are so damaging to the environment that they effectively wipe out any climate benefits. The study will be published in science journal Environmental Science & Technology.Using dozens of variables, researchers found that greenhouse-gas emissions -- largely from cars, trucks and other vehicles -- in the suburbs account for about 50 percent of all household emissions in the nation, even though less than 50 percent of the population lives in these areas.An interactive heat map illustrated the findings:Source: UC Berkeley CoolClimate NetworkAverage Annual Household Carbon Footprint (2013)The average household in Manhattan, for instance, has a carbon footprint of 32 metric tons annually -- the same amount of energy needed to power 6.7 cars for a year. But across the water in Great Neck, N.Y., the average household footprint is 72.5 metric tons, which would power more than 15 cars for a year. Similarly, San Francisco's annual household carbon footprint averages about 39, but levels spike to 64.6 in the nearby suburb of Danville. Chicago's levels are in the high 30s, but in the suburb of Glencoe, a whopping 93.2 metric tons.\u201cMetropolitan areas look like carbon footprint hurricanes, with dark green, low-carbon urban cores surrounded by red, high-carbon suburbs,\u201d said Christopher Jones, one of the study's authors. \u201cUnfortunately, while the most populous metropolitan areas tend to have the lowest carbon footprint centers, they also tend to have the most extensive high-carbon footprint suburbs.\u201dIndeed, households in dense urban areas tended to have carbon footprints about 50 percent below average, due in part to public transportation and smaller, multi-unit dwellings which require less energy to heat and cool. Households in the suburbs, however, had footprints about twice the average. Nationwide, household carbon footprints are generally lower in the West, with the densest population of high-carbon footprints centered in the Midwest.The study also revealed that as household income, home size and vehicle ownership increase, so do carbon emissions. But instead of adopting the policies of dense urban centers, the researchers suggested suburban communities seek out tailored solutions that fit their communities.\u201cA number of cities nationwide have developed exceptionally interesting and thoughtful sustainability plans; many of them very innovative,\u201d said Daniel M. Kammen, another author of the study. \u201c[But] cities need information about which actions have the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their communities. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.\u201d  Kammen suggested that using energy-efficient technologies might be a practical way for suburbs to tackle the problem.\u201cSuburbs are excellent candidates for a combination of solar photovoltaic systems (solar panels), electric vehicles and energy-efficient technologies,\" he said. \"When you package low-carbon technologies together you find real financial savings and big social and environmental benefits.\u201d"}, {"title": "Natural Gas Loses to Solar on Costs, A First", "text": "For those who already think natural gas will win out over renewable power, a judge has said, not so fast.In what may be the first time a U.S. solar power project has been declared cost-competitive against natural gas in a competitive bidding process, a judge has said solar is cheaper than natural gas. The ruling could be a road map for avoiding a new fossil fuel age dominated by big natural gas.On the last day of 2013, an administrative law judge for the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, Eric Lipman, issued a decision about competing energy investments for Minnesota's future. The state utility Xcel offered up several proposals to fill a 100 megawatt power need. The two main competitors were a new fossil fuel plant powered by natural gas and a series of many distributed solar projects to be built around the state, the so-called Geronimo $250 million solar proposal.This decision wrestled with competing visions of the U.S. energy future. Will it be dominated by new, large fossil fuel plants powered not by coal but by natural gas, as gas continues to replace coal - even though gas still emits significant greenhouse gas emissions? Many of the energy pundits say that is where we are heading. They argue that gas will be the cheapest fuel, beating out more expensive solar, so let's just ignore the climate impacts of gas. That's the conventional wisdom.But as with most conventional wisdom, it rests on a pile of unexamined assumptions. When this independent judge looked at the facts, rather than the hype, he found that solar wins and gas loses. He gave several reasons why solar is the preferred choice when all potential costs are considered.First, he said that future electricity demand is uncertain, at least in the next five years. In that, he echoes what we are seeing around the utility industry. Power demand is flat or declining. There are many reasons for the fall, but they suggest trouble for the electricity sector. Will electric utilities be able to survive as power demand drops? And most important, what kind of power plants will they invest in, to replace the smaller amounts of power they need - big ones or smaller, distributed ones?Second, he turned to the current and future carbon regulations that might apply to new fossil plants, including those using natural gas. Minnesota's existing law says fossil plants should not be built unless all renewable power is exploited first. The state's law also says the utility can obtain credits for solar purchases from new solar plants. He then examined how future carbon regulations could add to the price of power from a natural gas plant that would last for fifty years, as compared to a solar plant that has zero fuel costs.Third, he asked whether it was better to install smaller solar projects to avoid new transmission and distributed lines to serve electric customers. Those avoided lines would save the state over $33 million as compared to a new natural gas plant that would not avoid those costs.And then last, he asked the most important question, one that might foretell the future of energy policy in the competition of gas and renewable power. And that question was about scale - with the uncertain future of electric load, with the potential for added carbon costs and the real carbon emissions from natural gas, with the costs of new power lines for large plants, would it make more sense to approve funding for a large, central power plant powered by fossil fuel, or to make incremental, scalable investments in solar?This is how the judge put it when endorsing the solar proposals:[T]hese proposals offer competitively-priced energy generation; at firm prices; the fewest new environmental impacts; and significant protections against the imposition of project cancellation costs....[I]t bears mentioning that this procurement represents an important turning point in Minnesota's energy resource planning process. Since 1991, Minnesota has had a statutory preference in favor of renewable energy sources. Yet, that preference is overridden when the nonrenewable source has a lower total cost. Notwithstanding the statutory preference, it seemed that nonrenewable energy sources always won the head-to-head cost comparisons. Not anymore. Geronimo entered this bidding process as the sole renewable technology and beat competing offerors on total life-cycle costs.The judge added that the utility \"could avoid overbuilding generation facilities by deploying a scalable solution to meet future needs.\"So, in this new world of declining power needs, when the future costs of significant natural gas emissions, carbon controls and the scalable nature of solar power are considered - solar wins on hard costs.That rationale is far reaching beyond one state. Many states have the same kind of pro-renewable procurement rules as Minnesota, but they have not been enforced. For example, New England is now facing many new natural gas pipeline and power plant proposals, but the public officials have not figured out how to square their enthusiasm for gas with their own carbon reducing mandates for the power sector.This is a ruling that, if upheld by the full Commission on appeal, could provide a new way to think about the coming \"age of gas\". It says that, if the right costs are considered, gas might well lose to renewable power both now, and in our uncertain energy future."}, {"title": "Just In Case You've Forgotten, Half The Planet Is In The Middle Of A Sweaty Summer Right Now", "text": "In most parts of the U.S. right now, it is cooooooooold.

Treating animals like heads of lettuce --\"forget it's an animal\" says one farmer magazine -- has created institutionalized ruthlessness toward animals, workers and the environment at the same time it harms humans who eat the products. Factory farming even damages the economy thanks to meat-related obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer and greedy, short-sighted land-use policies.While many procedures on factory farms are cruel, some practices like breeding animals into mutant-like parodies of their original species and violating mother/offspring bonds are truly crimes against nature.Crime 4 -- Fast Growth DiseasesThirty years ago pigs, chickens and cattle did not look like they do today. Thanks to growth producing chemicals and selected breeding, factory-farmed turkeys can barely walk and can't fly at all or reproduce because of their extreme meat-intensive physiology. Chickens grow so intensely, if they were human they would weigh 500 pounds at age 10. The frenzied growth makes them prone to \"flip over disease\" in which the metabolic strain causes sudden death. Pigs given the growth drug ractopamine, illegal in many countries, are so muscle-bound they are practically non-ambulatory. \"Simply, the pig will go down and not be able to get back up,\" said Gary Bowman, an Ohio State Extension veterinarian with the College of Veterinary Medicine. Visitors to factory pig facilities have to wear biosecurity suits because \"the immobility, poisonous air and terror of confinement badly damage the pigs' immune systems,\" read an article in Rolling Stone.Under the use of the Monsanto-created genetically-altered recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), the udders of dairy cattle become so engorged, the animals can barely walk. The painful infections (called mastitis) the animals develop along with their shortened life spans and weakened conditions when they arrive at slaughterhouses, often as downers, are the ultimate crime against nature. Many grocery chains have renounced rBGH but some operators still use it for the \"cost savings.\"Crimes 5 -- Abuses Against Marine LifeWhile production of the fast-growing frankenfish, the AquAdvantage salmon, has temporarily halted, greed will likely prevail in aquaculture as it has in factory farming. The salmon, created by crossing a Chinook with an ocean pout and a wild Atlantic salmon, grows twice as fast as normal salmon, reaching its full size in 18 months instead of three years. Though the fish's creators and the government say it is no different from normal fish, in studies AquAdvantage salmon had high incidences of \"jaw erosion\" and \"focal inflammation\" (infection), low glucose levels and a possible \"increase in the level of IGF-1 [insulin-like growth factor-1]\" compared to normal fish.Like their factory farming counterparts, AquaAdvantage salmon promoters extol the reduced carbon footprint that can be achieved by squeezing animals together. Yonathan Zohar, PhD, from the Center of Marine Biotechnology at the University of Maryland said at FDA hearings that the fish can be grown at up to \"80 to 100 per cubic meter\"-- which is bumper to bumper fish. Is it ethical for a swimming animal to spend 18 months practically standing on its tail? In the interests of making more money? Is it ethical to expose wild fish populations to the aquaculture-generated sea lice which has all but decimated salmon farming in Chile and Norway?Crime 6 -- Brave New AnimalsAnother brave new animal which raises ethical questions is the Enviropig, a genetically modified line of Yorkshire pigs that has the capability to digest plant phosphorus more efficiently than ordinary unmodified pigs and produce a less phosphorus-rich manure. This would reduce damage to waterways and algae blooms with no cutback in factory farming itself. Brave New scientists at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, where the cloned sheep Dolly was created, have also developed chickens that produce eggs with interferon and other disease-fighting substances, functioning as living, breathing biofactories for humans. \"Once you've made the transgenic birds, then it's very easy,\" enthused scientist Helen Sang, PhD. \"You can breed up hundreds of birds from one cockerel [young male] -- because they can be bred with hundreds of hens and you can collect an egg a day and have hundreds of chicks in no time.\"While cloning was once the next big thing, it has lost its luster because of a problem called \"epigenetic dysregulation\" which causes up to 90 percent of cloned offspring to die. In fact, so many animals die to make one surviving clone, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies said \"the current level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal clones\" renders it not \"ethically justified.\" Cloned offspring \"tend to be large for their breeds, and often have abnormal or poorly developed lungs, hearts, or other affected internal organs (liver and kidney), which makes it difficult for them to breathe or maintain normal circulation and metabolism,\" says an FDA report. The problems are so common in cloned cattle and sheep, they are called Large Offspring Syndrome.Still, scientists at the University of Missouri, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Harvard Medical School have a clone product they are pretty proud of. They have developed \"White piglets with muscle tissue larded with omega-3 fatty acids,\" that can lead to \"healthy pork\" reports the New York Times, because such fatty acids are linked to a lowered incidence of heart disease. \"People can continue to eat their junk food,\" rhapsodized Harvard's Alexander Leaf, MD. \"You won't have to change your diet, but you will be getting what you need.\" Aren't animals great?This post first appeared on OpEdNews.com.--Martha Rosenberg is an investigative journalist covering the food, drug and gun industries.

The figure dwarves production rates of just over 1 billion tonnes each in Europe and the United States.Much of China's new capacity is in regions like Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, reflecting a strategy to close small mines in marginal locations like Beijing and consolidate output in a series of huge \"coal industry bases\" that will deliver thermal power to markets via the grid.While expanding output at such bases, China has shut more than 300 million tonnes of old capacity in the last decade, but critics say new mines are rapidly outpacing closures and the policy merely shifts China's environmental problems elsewhere.\"Despite the climate change pressure, water resource scarcity and other environmental problems, the coal industry is still expanding fast in northwest China,\" said Deng Ping, a campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace in Beijing.\"The scale of these coal bases has been rarely seen in other places in the world, with open-cast coal mines, coal power plants, and coal chemical plants all combined together.\"The new projects involved a total investment of 54.1 billion yuan ($8.9 billion). In 2012, the administration approved just four coal projects with 16.6 million tonnes of annual capacity and a total investment of 7.8 billion yuan.The list of approvals does not cover all mines launched in 2013, with many smaller projects under the purview of local authorities and not the central government. According to rules issued in December, coal mines producing more than 1.2 million tonnes per year need Beijing's go-ahead, while local governments can approve the rest.It takes the NDRC months to announce new mine approvals, so other projects may have been passed in the fourth quarter. One 46 million-tonne mine was approved in December but the NDRC has yet to publish details.An NDRC spokesman was not available to comment.TACKLING SMOGWith major cities hit by smog last year, the government has promised to ease its dependence on coal, a major source of air, soil and water pollution as well as climate-warming emissions.It has issued guidelines to restrict mining in residential areas, improve quality and reduce overcapacity.But coal is cheaper than all the alternatives and China is the world's biggest producer as well consumer. It is also far more reliable than intermittant energy sources like hydropower or wind.The 2011-2015 plan said around 860 million tonnes of new coal production capacity will be brought into operation, as well as 300 more gigawatts of coal-fired power, twice the total generation capacity of Germany.While Beijing said in September that it would cut the share of coal in its primary energy mix to \"less than 65 percent\" by 2017, down from 66.8 percent in 2012, consumption will still rise in absolute terms, with total energy demand set to grow 4.3 percent a year over the 2011-2015 period.\"The replacement of coal hasn't been as fast as expected, and other sources of energy are not only expensive but also face a lot of technical and environmental problems,\" said UOB's Lau.The government's 2011-2015 energy plan put coal production capacity at 4.1 billion tonnes by 2015, but Lau said it may be much higher.\"We estimate China's total coal production capacity will be 4.7 billion tonnes by 2015 - I think the government figure is a big underestimation.\"($1 = 6.0506 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by David Stanway; Editing by Richard Pullin)"}, {"title": "This Man Raised A Duckling In His Beard (PHOTOS)", "text": "A man says he has been raising a duckling in his beard -- and he has the photos to prove he isn't a quack.Reddit user Spongi said he failed to hatch chicken eggs but, somehow, a duck egg that got in the batch ended up hatching.

The MMPA calls for monitoring bycatch both by a government-managed observer program and by self-reporting from fishing vessels. It also calls for reducing incidental deaths and injuries of marine mammals, with the ultimate goal of eliminating death and injury altogether.Unfortunately, the MMPA standards are vague and not well-implemented. The NRDC reports that bycatch is rampant, with more than 650,000 marine mammals dying or getting severely injured each year as a result of bycatch.Because the federal government has never strictly enforced the MMPA, foreign fisheries have not invested in curtailing bycatch. As a result, these fisheries export problematic seafood to the United States.This infographic displays the various marine mammals that die or get injured as a result of U.S. seafood imports from all over the world.The MMPA clearly states:The Secretary of the Treasury shall ban the importation of commercial fish or fish products from fish which have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in excess of United States standards.If followed, this measure would extend protection for marine mammals across the globe. It would also ensure that the seafood Americans eat was not obtained while harming other animals. Additionally, it would create a level playing field for U.S. and international fisheries, requiring them to meet the same environmental protection standards.The NRDC recommends action on the federal and individual level. The National Marine Fisheries Service, the federal agency in charge of interpreting and overseeing the MMPA, should clearly define \u201cU.S. standards\u201d for bycatch, and should educated foreign fisheries on regional regimens for reducing bycatch.

But it might take physical barriers separating the two bodies of water to halt the disastrous spread of invasive species.According to a new study released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the fix will neither be easy nor immediate, and the bottom line could cost billions. The study advances eight alternatives that could help stop the spread of 13 invasive species, including carp, threatening the environmental health of the Mississippi River Basin and Great Lakes ecosystem. Commissioned by Congress in 2012, the study focused on the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), a 128-mile network of waterways around metropolitan Chicago. CAWS includes five aquatic pathways that connect to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basins.Aquatic nuisance species, or invasive species, can overwhelm new environments, choking out indigenous species. while causing serious environmental and economic harm -- for instance, the at-risk Great Lakes fishing industry, valued at $7 billion. Scud, bighead carp and silver carp are the three most likely threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem, after having reproduced mightily in the Mississippi River watershed. The carp gobble huge amounts of plankton vital to the ecosystem's food chain. Ten species threaten the Mississippi River basin, including bloody red shrimp, grass kelp, and a fish called the threespine stickleback.The study highlighted many methods to stem the tide of threatening species from migrating between both ecosystems, ranging from basic (removing fish with nets, public education) to technologically-advanced and significant construction processes, without advocating for one best solution. Structural controls like gate locks for boat traffic passing between water bodies and electric barriers that could repel or stun fish attempting to get through the locks could help prevent bighead and silver carp from forming a permanent home in the midwestern Great Lakes.More drastically, physical barriers could be placed to stop the flow of water from the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes. New waterways, known as buffer zones, would separate the two water basins with water that's filtered, screened and exposed to ultraviolet light. Since this move would likely impact water quality in the areas where the physical barriers were located, some alternatives include costs for building new treatment plants or a new tunnel and reservoir system to maintain water quality in Lake Michigan. Shipping interests and Chicago's boat tour industry have objected to this plan, however.The costs for the structural recommendations range from $7.8 to $18.4 billion dollars, according to the study's estimates, and could take as long as 25 years to finish design and construction. The Obama Administration has already poured about $200 million in shielding efforts to stop the Asian carp migration, including building an electrified barrier, according to The Associated Press.
