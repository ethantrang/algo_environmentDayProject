In the image, Legarth, who founded the Modisa Wildlife Project in Botswana with fellow animal lover Valentin Gruener, is seen hugging Sirga, a 110-pound lioness who had been abandoned as a cub.\"A pride had three cubs and two were killed before Sirga was abandoned without food,\" Legarth told Caters News Agency. \"It happened on our land and we could not stand by and watch her die.\"It was in February of last year that Legarth and Gruener took Sirga in. The animal had been severely dehydrated at the time, according to a 2012 post on the Modisa Wildlife Project's blog, but the duo nursed her back to health.\"We believe that she is probably the most spoiled and well-fed lion you can find in Botswana,\" Legarth wrote in the post. \"We made her milk from scratch -- fresh eggs, cream, milk, vitamins, sunflower oil and calcium -- [a] luxurious meal for a little lion. Now she is too old for milk, but we are still making sure to cut the best pieces of meat for her.\"Sirga's surrogate parents say that the lioness -- who interacts only with Legarth and Gruener to prevent excessive human contact -- is given plenty of space to roam and hunt in her natural habitat.Legarth and Gruener, who are from Denmark and Germany, respectively, founded the Modisa Wildlife Project in 2012.

Others can be reduced by collecting mercury vapor released in gold mining. And others will require large-scale investment to remove polluted soil and sediment, such as cleaning up nuclear materials from reactors in Chernobyl or Fukushima.THE NEW TOP TEN FOR 20131. Agbogbloshie, in Accra, Ghana, is a vast site for recycling electronic wastes (e-wastes) such as computers and printers, largely imported from the West and set ablaze to remove copper and other metals.The site is a hellish scene of black, toxic smoke that poisons thousands who work there or live nearby, and floats over the city's largest outdoor food market. Ghana annually imports around 215,000 tons of e-waste, expected to double by 2020. Lead levels at the site were as high as 18,125 parts per million -- the USEPA standard for lead in soil is 400 ppm.2. Chernobyl, a Ukrainian nuclear power plant that melted down in 1986, released 100 times the radiation of the Hiroshima atom bomb, affecting 150,000 square kilometers in the path of the plume and leaving an uninhabitable 19 mile exclusion zone. The cement sarcophagus the Soviets built around the melted reactor is crumbling and is to be replaced in 2015. But five to 10 million people live nearby and can't be relocated.3. The Citarum River Basin which supplies 80 percent of surface water to Indonesia's capital Jakarta, is contaminated with up to 1,000 times the lead allowed by the USEPA standards. Aluminum, manganese, and iron were also above acceptable levels. The government has negotiated a $500 million loan package with the Asian Development Bank as part of a $3.5 billion plan to restore the Citarum River Basin.4. Dzershinsk, Russia, one of Soviet Russia's principal sites for chemical weapons, is still making chemicals. Between 1930 and 1998, an estimated 300,000 tons of chemical wastes were improperly landfilled in and around the city of 245,000 people. Water showed levels of dioxins and phenol thousands of times above recommended levels. The Guinness Book of World Records named it the most polluted city in the world. In 2006, life expectancy in Dzershinsk was 47 for women and 42 for men.5. Hazaribagh, Bangladesh has dozens of tanneries releasing toxic wastes into the water supply to the capital Dhaka. Daily they dump 22,000 cubic liters of toxic waste, including cancer-causing hexavalent chromium -- the chemical investigated by Erin Brockovich in California that was the subject of a movie. The roughly 10,000 Bangladeshi workers and their families live next to contaminated streams, ponds, and canals.6. Kabwe, the second largest city in Zambia, is contaminated by lead mining and smelting. A 2006 study found children's blood lead levels exceeded recommended levels by five to ten times due to contamination. Children who play in the soil and young men who do small-scale mining are most at risk.The Zambian government is dealing with the issue thanks to $26 million from the World Bank and Nordic Development Fund.7. Kalimantan, on the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo, has small-scale gold mining, which is the support for 43,000 people. Most use mercury, which extracts gold from ore and is then burned off. The UN estimates that worldwide, this process each year releases more than 1,000 tons of mercury into the environment, 30 percent of all man-made mercury emissions. Mercury is a neurotoxin affecting local people directly through the air but also all of us through fish.The Indonesian government signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury October 10 this year and supported Blacksmith Institute and a local NGO, Yayasan Tambuhak Sinta (YTS), to reduce mercury release and exposure.8. The Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin in Buenos Aires, in Argentina has 15,000 industries releasing chemicals into the river. A 2008 report said that soil on the banks of the river contained high levels of zinc, lead, copper, nickel, and total chromium.Some 12,000 of the people near the river basin live on land not fit for human habitation. They suffer from diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, and cancer. Water from wells near the Matanza- Riachuelo river basin was not safe for drinking due to contamination. However, a billion dollar World Bank-funded effort will focus on sanitation and industrial pollutant abatement.9. The Niger River Delta in Nigeria has long seen oil spilled from production sites and pipelines, in part due to insecurity and ethnic conflict over recent years. Between 1976 and 2001 there were nearly 7,000 oil spills where most of the oil was never recovered. An average of 240,000 barrels of crude oil are spilled in the Niger delta every year due to mechanical failure, third party activity, and many unknown causes. The spills contaminated the surface and ground water, the air, and crops with hydrocarbons, including known carcinogens like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.10. Norilsk, Russia is an industrial city that held the world's largest heavy metals smelting complex until the early 2000s. Nearly 500 tons each of copper and nickel oxides and two million tons of sulfur dioxide are released annually into the air. Life expectancy for factory workers in Norilsk is 10 years below the Russian average. Some 130,000 local residents are exposed to particulates, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, and phenols each day. Past studies have found elevated copper and nickel concentrations in soil nearly everywhere within a 60km radius of the city. This has led to increased levels of respiratory diseases and cancers of the lungs and digestive system.Despite these Top Ten threats, some progress has been made in recent years to clean up sites. However, said one Blacksmith expert, some sites are too vast and require decades of work and billions of dollars to clean up.Blacksmith is working with funding from the World Bank and other donors to apply low-cost engineering solutions so that gold miners can recycle mercury instead of releasing it into the air, and it is devising similar solutions to reduce pollution.Ben Barber is a communications advisor to Blacksmith Institute."}, {"title": "The Local Food Project", "text": "By guest blogger Nate Luke, photographer and video directorThere's an old story that's just starting to be told again in the Ozarks. Or maybe these days it's being told more loudly and by a new generation of young farmers and entrepreneurs. Isn't that the way most stories begin again?I started searching the Ozarks for threads of the emerging local-food movement story when I photographed Jere Gettle at Baker Creek Seed Company, an heirloom seed company in Mansfield, Missouri, in 2006. The Gettle family's commitment to locate, protect, and share non-GMO seeds inspired me to search for growers where I live. I wanted to know the people who were using the seeds and sustainable growing practices that are foundational to our Ozark heritage.Shortly thereafter, I met Curtis Millsap at the Greater Springfield Farmer's Market. In his characteristic overalls, wide-brimmed straw hat, and wire-rimmed specs, Curtis was selling an array of stunning vegetables, shoulder-to-shoulder with other food and craft vendors in the parking lot of the Battlefield Mall. A few days later, I was invited to Millsap Farms, which is just north of the Springfield city limits, where Curtis and his wife, Sara, farm about three acres with their nine children--all girls, except for the new infant, Ruben--and a host of volunteers and rotating resident interns.As Sara stirred soup in three stockpots on the stove, the two shared their story: Through several iterations of farming projects and a variety of public offerings--including chicken and turkeys, hogs and piglets, seasonal vegetable and bakery CSA [community-supported agriculture] memberships, and now a pizza club that makes hand-tossed pizzas using seasonal farm produce and bakes them in traditional clay ovens, the family has made a life producing food that's good for families and good for the earth. The farm exudes a warm, community atmosphere: The dirt and the children, the shared meals, and the hard work envelope the visitors, students, interns, and CSA volunteers. Now the weekly pizza dinners are attracting a larger swath of Springfieldians who are interested in dining on local fare in a farm setting.As Millsap Farms was growing on the outskirts of town, Curtis was also instrumental in helping a group of citizens, spearheaded by his sister-in-law, Melissa Millsap, change the planning and zoning laws that prohibited farming and farm structures inside the city limits. Melissa and her husband, Adam, had a vision to establish an urban farm in a center-city neighborhood that was, by all accounts, a food desert, in which the mostly transient and renter population could only buy food from convenient stores. The Springfield community rallied to support the changes in planning and zoning, and in 2009, on an acre plot of land that had previously been a parking lot and the site of burned-down apartments beside Melissa and Adam's home, Urban Roots Farm began to slowly emerge as a four-season, high-intensity vegetable farm.The farm exclusively used sustainable and organic farming methods and invited neighbors to work and share in the bounty of their efforts. Melissa also helped to establish the nonprofit Springfield Urban Agriculture Coalition, which established 10 schoolyard gardens in Springfield Public Schools and created an intern-training program to help educate the next generation of urban farmers. Urban Roots currently sells produce to local restaurants, has a presence across from Millsap Farms in the pavilion structure at the new Farmer's Market of the Ozarks, and hosts an annual farm-to-table dinner that has attracted the attention of national press.Since I began photographing the emerging story of the local-food movement in Springfield, a lot of things have changed: Local-food-based grocery stores have emerged; restaurants have begun to feature food produced locally and even from their own gardens; a new farmer's market has arisen to support increasing consumer demand; a processing and distribution hub for locally grown food now feeds whole and fresh veggies and fruit to kids in a YMCA after-school program; and partnerships have been formed with a variety of institutions and nonprofit organizations to promote education about healthy, local growing and eating.The story that connects us to our Ozark homesteading roots also connects us to the national local-food movement, and the human element of this connection to our food and the people who care for it is what I hope to capture in these images. There is something in this work that is intrinsic and inspiring and burgeoning. Something nourishing that connects the soul of the land to our own souls, and to each other.View more of Nate's \"Local Food Project\" photographs here.Nate Luke is an adventurer by heart, advertising photographer by trade.

Fortunately, the design strategy can assist in facilitating innovation strategy, diagnosis, formulation and implementation.Design conventionally contributes to creating value in the value chain at four levels, dependent on the design maturity of the organization. According to the DesignenceTM model these are: (1) Lowest level - by differentiating offerings, (2) second level - by streamlining the process, (3) third level - creating unique internal and external configurations and (4) top level - assisting in the creation of actionable strategies.To plan and manage design strategy and ensure that it is responsible and accountable for its activities, relevant metrics need to be in place. When measuring design, one-size-fit-all does not apply and this kind of thinking can be directly counterproductive. Metrics need to align with the corporate strategy and the design strategy.As an example, when Apple decided to develop the iPhone, the firm was fiercely competing in an adaptive market with low malleability and low predictability. Plenty of marketing data was available for traditional cell phones and the technology was mature with touch screens already a proven technology. Apple had gained some experience by launching a short-lived phone together with Motorola in 2005 and felt that compromising with a non-Apple designer was hurting the offering.What Jobs then did, was to pursue a strategic disruptive innovation direction. He envisioned Apple leveraging its ability to provide excellent synchronization software by betting on cell phones becoming essential devices for portable information access. When launched in July 2007, the iPhone disrupted the entire cell phone market, driving Nokia, which had close to fifty percent market share, out of the business.Now conventional metrics for strategy implementation are achieving strategic goals in sales, brand value and stock performance. According to these lagging metrics, Apple has done extremely well along all three metrics. The new category Smartphone, enjoyed explosive growth and Apple successfully positioned itself in synchronization software. The firm's brand value (according to Interbrand) went up by 790% from 2007 to 2013 (130% average per year) and its share price grew by 530% from January 2007 to October 2013 (82% average per year).These metrics measure design aesthetics impact through sales and brand perception but do not speak to the design strategy used in managing the innovation necessary in order to achieve these results. We need other Design Quality Criteria content to act as early lead indicators and to be focused on innovation management. The Concept Attention Profile does this by measuring designers' design discourse focus on user activity for breakthrough innovations.We have only indirect information access to these metrics, first, through the official autobiography on Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson, which describes Job's dedication to making users activities easier and second, through the auditing of the Industrial Design Excellent Award (IDEA) by the Industrial Design Society of America (IDSA). Here, Apple performed about average with regard to focusing on user activities, in line with the IDEA Gold Award winners.Metrics differ with the nature of innovation. If the firm is pursuing an incremental innovation (investing and exploiting mode) standard financial and brand metrics are useful for the Design Quality Criteria Process, Function and Expression. On the other hand, if the firm is engaged in breakthrough innovation (betting and exploring mode), context and process metrics have to be added as they are building unique inimitable capacities.Ultimately, it comes down to how the organization is defining its strategy. Is the organization looking at design as a competitive advantage on the market or is the organization adopting a more risk-driven attitude and looking for a sustainable competitive advantage through design as a core competency? This translates into a \"design you cannot see\" capacity building, which is difficult to copy even when publicly available. A coherent design strategy can help organizations to effectively navigate these options.

In 2012, such blazes consumed an acreage equivalent to the combined size of Massachusetts and Connecticut. This year has likewise proved to be exceptionally devastating in many regards. You've likely heard conversations about the Rim Fire -- California's fourth-largest wildfire ever, burning a total of 260,000 acres -- or the Yarnell Fire, a tragedy that claimed the lives of 19 firefighters in Arizona.After hearing about these events time and time again, one might develop questions that most articles on the topic fail to address. Why do wildfires continue year after year? Can't we do something to better manage fires? To further compound matters, wildfire reports or news segments are likely to include terms the majority of us are unfamiliar with -- making these questions that much more difficult to answer.Of course, questions like the above are also long-standing; wildfires have been happening for as long as lightning and forests have been around. But to be clear, the ways in which wildfires impact us are evolving. Here are five key facts to understanding wildfires in today's ecosystems:1. Wildfires are a natural occurrence, but they're changing.  Though many wildfires are caused by human carelessness or sparks from machinery, much of the land burned annually can be traced to lightning strikes or the sun's heat. These fires can, when properly managed, actually be beneficial to forest ecosystems. However, a number of factors -- including decades of fire suppression, 'invasive species' like cheatgrass (a highly flammable plant taking hold in the American west) and the habitat range expansion of pine bark beetles (which kill off trees that then drop their parched needles on our forest floors) -- are changing the frequency and intensity of these natural fire cycles. Together with climate change (which is resulting in drier summers and more intense storms that can trigger lightning strikes in many parts of the country), these factors are creating wildfires that are stronger, hotter and more unpredictable.2. Land recovers from wildfires, but slowly -- and it often needs help.  It will take years for some of the scarred land affected by the Rim Fire to regenerate naturally, and some may never do so without our help. Generally speaking, if a wildfire is too hot, tree roots and seeds buried deeply in the soil can be killed. If damage caused by a wildfire reaches this extent, restoration -- a process in which ecologists, land managers or other professionals are tasked with replanting and stabilizing a natural area -- is needed.3. When replanting, some methods are smarter than others. Landowners, both public and private, need to be careful about restoration efforts in order to keep out harmful invasive species. Ongoing studies in regions across the world are uncovering the best plants to introduce to a region post-wildfire. For example, Chicago Botanic Garden scientist Dr. Andrea Kramer is working to bolster restoration efforts at the site of last year's Pine Ridge Fire in Grand Junction, Colorado. Dr. Kramer's research is testing certain plant species that could potentially replace the seeds currently being used for restoration.4. Reintroducing native plants helps to maintain healthy landscapes.  Early findings from Dr. Kramer's research show that certain 'native plants' -- or those plants that have occurred naturally for many years in a given area -- likely outperform the seed mixes traditionally used by local restoration efforts in several important ways. For example, data show some native plants (we call them 'native winners') are better at growing quickly and reducing soil erosion after fires. Perhaps more importantly, these native winners might be the key to keeping out the non-native invasive species, like cheatgrass (mentioned above), that make wildlands more prone to uncontrollable wildfires. Native winners' performance in these indicators makes them better candidates for restoration. Properly managed, they can help break the cycle of wildfires escalating out of control.5. There is hope that the future will have \"better\" wildfires.  Many organizations are working together to ensure future fires on our public and private lands, especially in the American West, will be \"better.\" That is, we're working toward prescribing and managing natural fires so they are healthy for the land without compromising future forest health or harming human communities.  Much can be written on the science of wildfires, and indeed much has been. Still, knowing the above facts will help you better understand the issues surrounding wildfires. Should the above statements have created an appetite for further understanding, Paul Tullis' recent feature in The New York Times Magazine explores the debate on wildfire suppression through the lens of the latest advancements in fire science.  As we move deeper into fall, we hope to hear of fewer and fewer wildfires. And as research continues, we are confident that the passionate experts who have dedicated their careers to this work will make great strides in mitigating wildfires and restoring healthy ecosystems."}, {"title": "Underground Carbon Sequestration Can Cause Earthquakes Too, Study Shows", "text": "From Climate Central's Bobby Magill:Two scientists have found evidence that underground carbon dioxide injection in oil and gas fields may cause earthquakes, a finding that suggests carbon sequestration projects could shake the earth, too.Carbon sequestration projects, also called carbon capture and storage, or CCS, projects, are thought to be one solution to reducing climate change-fueling carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources. Several such projects are currently being studied across the country.CO2 storage facility at a Norwegian offshore gas facility. (Photo by Heidi Wideroe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Though scientists have speculated that it's possible that injecting gas underground could cause seismic activity, there had been no hard evidence, until now. Seismologists Wei Gan of China University of Geosciences and Cliff Frohlich of the University of Texas-Austin investigated why a West Texas oil field experienced 93 earthquakes in 2009 and 2010, some of which were Magnitude 3 or greater, and they were surprised by what they found.Frohlich said he originally thought the earthquakes were caused by an oil production process called \u201cwaterflooding,\u201d which involves the injection of large amounts of water into the ground to help move oil deposits into wells, increasing crude oil production.\u201cI was surprised when I found the quakes in West Texas appear to be caused by carbon injection,\u201d he said.He and Gan were studying quakes in the Cogdell oil field southeast of Lubbock where scientists have found that waterflooding induced earthquakes between 1975 and 1982. The scientists ruled out water injection as a cause of the recent quakes in part because much less water had been injected into the ground in the Cogdell field over the past decade than between 1957 and 1982.But since 2004, large volumes of carbon dioxide were injected into the ground in the Cogdell field. The study says the timing of the gas injection suggests it may have triggered quakes Magnitude 3 or greater, according to the study.The study concludes that understanding when carbon dioxide injection can trigger earthquakes will help officials evaluate risks associated with storing carbon dioxide deep underground as a way to combat climate change.\u201cThe implications (of the study) have more importance to the climate community,\u201d Frohlich said. \u201cOf the things that have been proposed (to address climate change), the one probably farthest along is carbon dioxide sequestration.\u201dFrohlich said the study does not prove that CCS projects will cause earthquakes, but it shows that they could.\u201cIt\u2019s not a smoking gun,\u201d said Wayne Pennington, interim dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan Technological University, who reviewed Gan and Frohlich\u2019s paper prior to publication. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen everywhere. It does not mean you cannot do carbon sequestration. It removes one level of uncertainty.\u201dScientists don\u2019t know why underground water injection related to oil and gas development causes earthquakes in some places but not in others. Likewise, scientists don\u2019t know why carbon dioxide injection would cause quakes in some places, but not in others, he said.\u201cThe bottom line here is, as Gan suspected, carbon dioxide injection under high enough pressures and with high enough volume could induce seismicity just like any other fluid at high enough pressures and with high enough volume,\u201d Pennington said. \u201cWe see (quakes) fairly often with water injection. We know that that can often trigger seismic events and sometimes those can be quite large. So, it isn\u2019t really a surprise that carbon dioxide injection does the same thing. Now the element of mystery is gone.\u201dThe study\u2019s findings shouldn\u2019t discourage carbon sequestration projects but they should inspire further discussion and research into several questions related to induced seismicity, Frohlich said.\u201cHow come it happens in some places and not in others?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere can we inject and when can we inject?\u201dThe study, \u201cGas injection may have triggered earthquakes in the Cogdell oil field, Texas,\u201d was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."}, {"title": "The Urban Stage on Election Day, Seattle Style", "text": "It's 11th-hour politics in my hometown of Seattle. This year, incumbent Mayor Mike McGinn -- who some call the most progressive mayor in America -- has faced an election challenge focused more on provocative, pluralist style than the issues themselves. In general, our mayor's race has been local in focus, without ample attention to how McGinn reflects, if not leads, the trend lines of changing cities everywhere.A case-in-point comes from Seattle Times' November 3 editorial, a regional piece about the role of policing and mental health reform in perceptions of street safety downtown.In the quixotic headline: \"Street disorder makes downtown Seattle feel like a mansion with dry rot.\" The editorial proceeds in support of the challenger, state Senator Ed Murray, and without full regard to the world-stage idea of what Seattle is.Seattle's liberal moniker may actually predicate the iconic New York City mayor's race, a post-Bloomberg defining moment more closely watched than our own. At issue there is a model of governance that will predict the voting outcomes for evolving American demographics, as well as a decided tilt toward equity and the new urban populism.Often, it takes such icons to remind us of who we are.In a New York Times article, candidate Bill de Bliaso's wife, Chirlane McCray, pointed to Seattle in the context of her husband's post-Bloomberg focus, hoping to restore New York's reputation as what she called \"a progressive capital.\" She showed concern that New York \"has trailed behind cities like San Francisco, Seattle, even Cleveland.\"And, in the last few days, the Washington Post framed another attention-getting national story: If McGinn loses, the article implied, one of his signature 2009 campaign issues, daylighting dark wire broadband in the City on a widespread basis. might never be realized because of Comcast's financial support of his opponent (an implication which Murray later denied, criticizing McGinn's implementation and not the premise itself).I have made no secret of my belief that Seattle -- once a tip-of-the-tongue \"livable city\" -- has growing pains around the undeniable playing fields of urban change -- transit, safety, education, climate change, energy sources and broadband, to name but a few. But I prefer the creative over the Seattle Times' quixotic to make my point. My well-documented focus on the \"sit-able city\" last month grew as much from our mayoral debates over downtown public safety concerns as it did from overseas photography and inspiration.In Seattle, the progressive ideals already on the map are not so much at issue. The mayor's race has been more about the delivery of those ideals, and the challenger has really not brought new content to related discussions surrounding social justice, education, safe urban places for all or other vanguards that typically fall under the progressive flag.As noted, it's late in the game and we are onstage, partly because of the provocative conviction of the mayor we have. Using sensational words, such as the \"dry rot\" of downtown in today's Seattle Times editorial, does nothing to advance admiration of who we already are.Image composed by the author in Seattle.

For others, some houses just don't make a good site for renewables.Never fear, there are still plenty of ways to get in on the clean energy revolution. Here are just a few of them.Use less energy From installing LED bulbs to adjusting the thermostat, we already know that energy conservation can both save you money and slash carbon emissions. What's less talked about, however, is that it also makes clean energy more viable. One of the biggest challenges we face in ramping up renewables is the problem of \"intermittency,\" meaning that solar and wind can be somewhat unpredictable. That's not an insurmountable problem \u2014 there are many ways to make renewables more reliable \u2014 but reducing the overall demand for energy would be a huge help in making the supply side of the equation less daunting.Buy green power If you live in a state or country with deregulated electricity markets, you may have the choice of buying electricity from a 100 percent green energy company like Clean Currents. That means you won't just be buying out of coal and other fossil fuels, but you'll also be helping to build a more powerful voice for the alternatives. To see how dramatically this can change the landscape, look at the story of Ecotricity's Dale Vince in the U.K., who went from living \"off-grid\" in a bus to building a gigantic wind energy empire, and publicly taking on the traditional \"Big Six\" utilities in the U.K. for their lack of progress. If you don't have the luxury of consumer choice in your electricity market, you may still be able to invest in green energy programs through your utility. The U.S. Department of Energy has a list of green energy markets by state.Support businesses that use green power Every time you drink a beer from New Belgium Brewery, you can also raise a glass to green energy. The company is proudly wind-powered and employee-owned, and it seems to be expanding fast with a new brewery opening in Asheville, N.C. From Apple's gigantic solar farm through IKEA's huge investments in renewable energy, an increasing number of businesses are buying some or all of their power from clean energy sources.It's not just the big guys either. My own small branding agency purchases green energy credits to cover our consumption, as do many of our clients. And in my neck of the woods I see solar panels appearing on everything from a car repair shop to a trade show exhibit manufacturer. Where you have the choice, choose to use businesses that put their weight behind renewable energy \u2014 and let them know why you are doing so.Donate to clean energy campaigns and charities From the collaboration- and research-based approach of the Rocky Mountain Institute to the campaigns of Greenpeace, there's no shortage of causes you can donate to that are either developing alternatives to fossil fuels or campaigning for a change in the system. And if you are motivated by international poverty alleviation work, you can still support clean energy \u2014 simply by donating to groups like the Solar Electric Light Fund or Solar Aid to bring reliable energy to communities that need it.Vote, Vote, Vote Whether it's the fight over the future of net metering in Arizona, or national controversies like Keystone XL or Department of Energy loan guarantees for renewables, the fight both for and against clean energy is going on at the community, state, national and even international levels. Participating in the democratic process is a crucial strategy for keeping progress on track. Choose candidates who value clean energy innovation and environmental protection, and make sure they know that these issues matter to you."}, {"title": "Tanzania Suspends Campaign Against Elephant Poaching To Investigate Reports Of Killings", "text": "The government of one African country has reportedly suspended its campaign to crack down on elephant poaching.According to the Agence France Presse, Tanzania shelved its anti-poaching operations on Friday in order to investigate reports of wrongful property seizure, torture and killings that were allegedly perpetrated by officials during the campaign, dubbed \"Operation Terminate.\"Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Khamis Kagasheki defended the program, arguing: \"I admit that there is an ugly side in the operation,\" he said. \"But what is happening now in arresting culprits and impounding tusks is part of the success of the operation.\"Illegal ivory poaching is a big problem in Tanzania, a country that is estimated to have lost about half its elephant population to poachers in the last decade, primatologist Jane Goodall said last year.However, the recent crackdown against elephant poaching has been swift and thorough. Tanzanian officials promised the country would use all the resources it had in combating poachers and said more than 950 poachers had been arrested in the past two months alone, Chinese news agency Xinhua reports.As recently as Saturday, authorities seized nearly two tons of ivory from a house in the city of Dar es Salaam, an amount that represents the deaths of hundreds of elephants.But the campaign has brought its share of controversy, too. Kagasheki was criticized after suggesting last month that ivory poachers be shot on the spot.Some argue that's not the best way to deal with the matter.\"[Killing poachers] would lead to an escalation in violence; it\u2019s very difficult to control who is actually killing,\" Bell'Aube Houinato, the World Wildlife Fund's country director in Tanzania, told The Guardian. \"There are law enforcement and judicial systems and they should be made more effective.\"(hat tip, Reddit)"}, {"title": "Microbes: Nature's Greatest Gift", "text": "Is our antimicrobial obsession making us sick?Killing bugs has become a modern-day pastime. Just scan the products on offer at your local supermarket. There's anti-bacterial this and antiseptic that. Antibacterial soap, often with triclosan added for its supposed antifungal and antiviral properties, is a popular choice on the personal hygiene aisle even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration states on its website that \"the agency does not have evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.\u201d (See more here.) And these days it seems that everywhere you turn there's a handy little dispenser of hand sanitizer, some with triclosan and others alcohol-based.If you are up on your reading, however, you are no doubt aware of a growing body of data (see here, here and here) that suggest that this all-out war on germs may be counterproductive, may in fact be making us sick. Instead of making your home as antiseptic as possible, you may be a lot better off rolling around in the dirt with all those little bugs or doing it by proxy by cohabiting with a dog or other low-to-the-ground, dirt-loving creature.Why, you may ask, would it be good to get down and dirty with the bugs? How, you may ask, can killing germs make us sick? A nice summary of the evidence in support of a microbially friendlier lifestyle appeared recently as a perspective piece in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Graham Rook of the University College London. He argues that our immune system requires \"microbial input from the environment,\" and to get that input, he advises finding green spaces.We All Know Green Spaces Are Good for UsThe idea that green spaces are good for us is certainly not news. Most everyone knows that hanging out in a park or hiking in the woods feels good, so it's got to be good for you, right? Well, yes, there are data to back that up. Previous studies (see here, here and here) have documented a host of what might be termed psychological benefits. The data suggest, Rook writes, that living close to nature\u201creduces overall mortality, cardiovascular disease, and depressive symptoms and increases subjective feelings of well-being. \u2026 Looking at green spaces or walking in parkland or forests cause rapid \u2026 changes that can be demonstrated not only by psychological testing but also by mobile electroencephalograms and by measurements of cerebral blood flow, various cardiac parameters, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol.\"But the author sounds two cautionary notes with regard to the significance of these data.So does that mean that Rook rejects the notion that green spaces provide health benefits? Hardly.The Real Benefits of Green Spaces Come From the BugsWhile most folks think that hanging out in nature is beneficial because it soothes and calms, Rook argues that much more substantial benefits come from the exposure to microbes that green spaces afford. While some microbes are without doubt harmful and disease-causing, the vast majority are not and in fact many are beneficial. And it's exposure to these bugs that make green spaces so essential in Rook\u2019s view.Immunological BenefitsWe are witnessing an alarming growth in autoimmune diseases ranging from chronic inflammation to asthma to potentially life-threatening conditions such as lupus. In each case, Rook writes, the \"cause is at least partly a failure of immunoregulation, so that the immune system is attacking inappropriate targets, such as self, harmless airborne antigens (allergens) and gut contents.\" He goes on to point out that more and more studies (see here, here and here) are showing that exposure to bugs, especially at an early age, is essential for training and calibrating our immune system, teaching it, in a sense, what are the things it should attack and what it shouldn't. And without appropriate calibration, the immune system can mistake the good guys for the bad guys.By raising babies in urban environments devoid of bug-rich green spaces, we may very likely be depriving them of exposure to the diversity of bugs needed to form a healthy immune system and thereby setting them up for a life of chronic pain and illness. (Along similar lines, it\u2019s been argued that C-section births lead to a deficit in good microbes in babies.) Rook refers to the bugs needed to train our immune system as our \"Old Friends\" defined as \"organisms ... from mankind's evolutionary past that needed to be tolerated and therefore evolved roles in driving immunoregulatory mechanisms.\"Microbiota EffectThe other benefit of exposure to bugs arises from the fact that a good part of each and every one of us is actually a huge microbial community. As we grokked about last year, we humans share our bodies, mostly in harmony, with trillions of microbes -- on our skin, in our guts, and just about every place in between. These bugs, especially those in our gut, carry out critical functions like digesting food, fending off infections, helping to build the heart and other organs and possibly influencing our diet and behavior. A number of recent studies suggest that our microbiome may play a critical role in promoting or preventing obesity. (See also here.)Here again living in an environment devoid of green spaces without exposure to a suitable diversity of microbes may deprive ourselves of bugs that play essential roles for our own health.Ecosystem ServicesThere are any number of reasons to preserve the natural environment. For some people, the intrinsic value of a green space is self-evident -- meadows, forests, mountains, et cetera should be protected regardless of their value to people. Many others don't share those sentiments and feel that human needs must come first. They want more objective, economic metrics to justify preservation. To address that need, scientists have developed the concept of ecosystem services -- the valuation of services such as clean water, clean air, pollution abatement that natural ecosystems provide. (See also here.) In many cases the value of such ecosystem services far outweighs the economic value of exploiting the ecosystem and therefore justifies its preservation.Rook argues that the microbes one finds in green spaces are \"a major component of the beneficial effect of green space, and a neglected ecosystem service that is essential for our well-being.\" When tallying up the value of a green space, we should add in the value it provides in support of our physical health. Is that valuable?

The six proposed coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest are among them. If these terminals are approved, they will unleash one of the biggest carbon sources on the planet, by creating a new pathway for Western US coal to reach Asian markets, and it will be hard to put the genie back in the bottle.That's why I traveled to Tacoma, Washington, in late October for a public hearing against the proposed Longview coal export terminal. I was floored and inspired to see the sea of red shirts marking the hundreds upon hundreds of clean energy supporters attending and speaking out at the hearing. It's an electrifying movement that has stopped three of the six proposed terminals to date - the climate pollution equivalent of stopping 35 new coal-fired power plants. When we stop all six projects, that will equal the carbon impact of stopping 105 new coal plants.Washingtonians know that putting this carbon into the atmosphere would be catastrophic for our climate. A new study in the prestigious journal Nature found that by 2050, if we don't reduce our carbon pollution, what are now our hottest years and hottest temperatures may become our coldest years and coldest temperatures.In 2050, my three-year-old daughter Hazel will be the age I am today. Once our kids are adults, it will be too late to turn this around. We are the last generation of people who can stop climate change.A coal export terminal is proposed for Oregon as well, and opposition there is just as strong. What's more, one of the companies (Ambre Energy) proposing to build the Morrow Pacific terminal just had to delay its permit again because the state department of lands said the company still had not provided enough information for the agency to make a decision. This is the company's SIXTH permit delay!That's just another example of a foreign company failing to do their homework so Pacific Northwest families know the full risk posed by exporting coal through their communities.As a West Virginian, I testified at the Tacoma hearing about the realities of a \"coal boom\" to the people at that Longview hearing: The coal industry would just love to bring you a boom and bust economy, along with the asthma and heart attacks from coal pollution. The coal industry has been doing that in Appalachia for 100 years.While I was in Tacoma, I also met with leaders from the Lummi Nation to thank them for their leadership in the opposition to the proposed Cherry Point terminal, which threatens their ancestral fishing and burial lands. It was an honor to meet Jewell James, a longtime Lummi leader who recently made headlines, including this USA Today story, when he led a powerful totem pole journey across sacred lands of the West that ended at the Cherry Point site. Here is how the organizers described it:The House of Tears carvers of the Lummi community has created a tradition of carving and delivering totem poles to areas struck by disaster or otherwise in need of hope and healing. Now it is Lummi Nation's own sacred landscape, Xwe'chi'eXen, that needs hope, healing and protection. The most imminent threat to this sacred landscape and to treaty rights associated with Xwe'chi'eXen comes from a proposal to build North America's largest coal port: the Gateway Pacific Terminal.I'm inspired by the thousands of people - tribal members, parents, doctors, nurses, business owners, faith leaders, teachers, public officials, and more - who have spoken out against coal exports at all the recent hearings in Washington. More than 5,000 people have attended these hearings in recent months to express overwhelming opposition to these projects.On top of that, hundreds also showed up for another hearing last week, Washington Governor Jay Inslee's hearing on how the state can fight climate disruption. People are speaking out in droves for strong action on climate. And their leaders are listening - last week the governors of Washington, Oregon, and California, along with the premier of British Columbia, signed an agreement to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate disruption.This leadership in the Northwest is combining with the efforts nationwide that are making a difference. Over the past decade, communities have worked together to stop 182 new coal plants, and they've also won the retirement of 152 existing coal plants.Join them - send a comment urging the rejection of the coal export terminals. We want our public officials to demonstrate the leadership on climate change that this nation and the world are desperate seeking."}, {"title": "Elephant Poaching Threatens Animals' Culture; Leaves Lasting Impact, Research Suggests", "text": "By Megan Gannon, LiveScience News Editor:Poaching and habitat loss may be putting elephants at risk of losing their culture \u2014 the learned behaviors that seem to be passed down from generation to generation, researchers say. What's more, the trauma of separation and displacement may have lasting psychological impacts on the creatures resembling post-traumatic stress disorder in humans, according to a new study.There's truth in the saying \"Elephants never forget.\" The huge land mammals are known to recognize individuals that they haven't seen in decades. One study published a few years ago showed that the older female matriarchs of elephant herds in Africa even seemed to remember distant sources of water from their youth, which helped keep their groups alive during later periods of drought.Older elephants have a deep well of experience to draw from: The average life span of an elephant in the wild is 60 or 70 years. Though social learning has not been definitively proven among elephants, there is evidence that older family members pass down their knowledge to youngsters. But the species' complex social structure can be disrupted when herds are fragmented and calves are orphaned, researchers say. [Elephant Images: The Biggest Beasts on Land]Social disturbance can also lead to deviant behaviors among youngsters. The authors of the new study pointed to groups of orphaned male elephants in two protected areas in South Africa. Without older males to keep them in check, the young animals became abnormally aggressive and killed 107 rhinoceroses over a period of 10 years, the researchers said.\"We previously knew very little of how crucial skills of communication and cognitive abilities that are at the basis of complex societies might be affected by disruption,\" study researcher Karen McComb, from the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. \"While elephants in the wild can appear to recover, apparently forming quite stable groups, our study was able to reveal that important decision-making abilities that are likely to impact on key aspects of the elephant's social behavior may be seriously impaired in the long run.\"McComb and colleagues conducted experiments with two populations of elephants. One group was made of up orphans introduced to Pilanesberg National Park South Africa in the early 1980s and 1990s after a series of culling operations. The other group was a relatively undisturbed population in Amboseli National Park, Kenya.The researchers played elephant vocalizations, both familiar and unfamiliar, to simulate different levels of social threat for the two groups of animals and observed their reactions.Compared with the Pilanesberg elephants, the Amboseli group made better decisions in correctly recognizing foreign elephants as a greater threat than familiar elephants, the study found. This herd also showed it could distinguish between the calls of elephants of different age classes; the Amboseli elephants were most defensive in the face of calls from older animals, representing more dominant individuals, the researchers said. A rank-appropriate response is necessary to keep the peace in elephant hierarchies and avoid violence.While the Wildlife Conservation Society has estimated that some 25,000 African elephants are killed each year, the new research highlights that the survivors of poaching and culling operations may be at risk for unseen social problems.\"The dramatic increase in human disturbance is not just a numbers game but can have profound impacts on the viability and functioning of disrupted populations at a deeper level,\" study researcher Graeme Shannon, also of Sussex, said in a statement.The findings were detailed online Oct. 23 in the open-access journal Frontiers in Zoology.Follow Megan Gannon on Twitter and Google+.

It contains dozens of traditional and personal stories and takes the from of a film, an iPad/iPhone App and a website. The filmmakers are currently seeking crowdfunding on Indiegogo to complete their four-year passion project.It all began in 2010, when Ben, editor Jos Pederick, photographer/ cinematographer Ali Sanderson, and motion graphics designer Michael Duff -- who as a team form Goodmorningbeautiful Films -- spent ten days traveling 2,300 km down the Murray Darling with a group of Australian Aboriginal elders.The Goodmorningbeautiful Film Team. Photo by MeiMei FoxAfter 10 years of terrifying drought, the Murray Darling was dying. A group of Aboriginal nations had united to attempt to save the river and the life that relied upon it. The film crew's objective was to document the performance of the Ringbalin, a traditional rain dance.Ringbalin proved a tremendous success. Rain clouds followed the group throughout their journey south. By the time the indigenous people had finished their dance rain was falling. What followed were the biggest floods on record in Australia. Uncle Moogy, the founder of the modern Ringbalin, responded, \"People say it had to rain sometime. Of course it did. But it just rained when we danced.\"Uncle Herb Wharton, Kooma Tribe. Photo by Ali SandersonThe film crew was profoundly affected by their Ringbalin experience. \"Traveling with the elders opened my mind,\" Ben said. \"It was like looking through a time scope 30,000 years back before the pyramids were built. All of the stories we heard had been passed down from person to person, mother and father to child, on and on and on.\"As they realized how many wonderful, funny and wise stories the Aboriginal elders could tell that went way beyond the scope of the immediate expedition, Ben and his colleagues expanded their vision for the film. That's when they opted to create a geo-located documentary/app/website that uses Australia as a stage to explore issues of ancient wisdom, modern humanity and climate change. They wanted to create \"something you could travel into, where elders of the 40 nations who share the rivers could create song lines of story and myth for you to discover.\" They longed for you to be able to see the world through the eyes of the ancients.Aunty Cheryl Buchanan, Guwamu Tribe. Photo by Ali SandersonI wondered what advice the Aboriginal elders might have for us, in this day of furious debate over climate change policy. Ben told me that Uncle Tom Trevorrow, an amazing leader of the Ngarrindjeri Nation, offered guidance to the Australian government so powerful that it now sits on the front page of the legislation that changed how they run their seminal Murray Darling River program.Uncle Tom said, \"Our traditional management plan was don't be greedy. Don't take any more than you need. And respect everything around you.\" That's the management plan -- it's such a simple management plan, but so hard for people to carry out.\"Aunty Beryl Carmichael, Ngiyampaa Tribe.

Follow your own gut feeling, hone your skills and instincts and do the hours. Line up the minutes until they are years of effort.\"In conclusion, Ben urged each of us to learn about the First Nations and make the time to listen to the earliest stories from the regions we call home. \"The words we speak rustled through grasses, crashed on sandy beaches, and broke from mountain crags before they tickled our tongues.

Moyer, however, argued that similar policies in Europe have had the opposite effect. \"[GMO labels] become a de facto warning label for people,\" Moyer said. \"What ends up happening is that then those foods are taken off of store shelves and consumers are left with a reduced amount of choice at the end of the day.\"Moyer also explained that recent scientific studies have shown that GMOs are just as safe as other foods.For Hirshberg, though, the most damaging argument against genetically modified crops is that their introduction has gone hand in hand with the increased use of chemicals in our agriculture. \"From my vantage point, the argument is very simple,\" Hirshberg said. \"Since the introduction of these crops, we've seen an explosion in the use of herbicides in this country.

The Secretary was certainly visible in her wide travels over the vast domain of lands the Interior Department manages which covers about 20 percent of America's geography. But there wasn't much to show in terms of direction, commitment, action items or even intent. So this speech was generating a lot of anticipation, with somewhat low expectations for the message.When she concluded her speech she got the standing ovation. I think everyone in the room breathed that collective sigh of relief. The reaction from conservationists, park rangers, sportsmen, and environmentalists were all positive. She pinned the donkey tail on Congress for not adding a single new acre of land for conservation since 2010. The last time there was a Congress that failed to protect any new lands was more than 60 years ago. She rightly slammed the recent government shutdown as enormously wasteful and added that there was absolutely no political agenda in the National Park Service closing down access to visitors during the shutdown.More importantly, she talked about balance between conservation of America's finest landscapes, particularly our national parks, and energy development. She echoed the view that there can be responsible energy development while safeguarding wilderness, wildlife, and scenic and recreation values. She even highlighted Master Leasing Plans, which are an innovative tool to encourage oil and gas drilling in areas of least conflict and ensure the multiple-use mandate of our public lands by protecting other values. More broadly she talked about the need to do planning on a larger landscape level. That is something we at Park Rangers for Our Lands have been urging from the beginning of her tenure.To her credit, she specifically highlighted threats runaway oil and gas development poses to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Many of our greatest national parks face the same challenges such as Arches and Canyonlands National Parks in Utah, Mesa Verde National Park and Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado, and Chaco Culture National Historic Park in New Mexico. If we don't find a way to take a more balanced approach to what happens on the doorsteps of these national parks, we stand to lose the cultural values and beauty millions of American families have come to enjoy and cherish every year.We believe that we must develop oil and gas on public lands for America's energy independence. However, we've also argued that energy development can occur, without sacrificing the values of our national parks. Secretary Jewell embraced that position, and we commend her for it.The challenge now is how much can be done in the short time remaining. As discouraging as it sounds, the secretary only has a little more than a year left to really make a difference. After that the nation will be in full campaign mode again, and this administration will become a lame duck. I would prefer it to be otherwise. Secretary Jewell showed herself to be a leader who grasped the complexities and subtleties of the problems and challenges her department faces. She understood the need for a landscape level perspective on planning. And she seems to understand the natural, social, and political elements at play in the issues that always swirl around conservation vs. development.I had the chance to meet Sally Jewell at a reception shortly before her speech. I told her we are ready to support her department's preservation and conservation agenda. I hope she will take us up on that offer by taking concrete actions supporting her vision for balance between conservation and energy development. And I hope she will use this next year to make serious progress in protecting lands for preservation whether through Congress or through the President's use of the Antiquities Act. There is still time for a conservation legacy, but she will have to hurry."}, {"title": "Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline Fight: Critical Part of Tackling Dirty Energy and Climate Change", "text": "When it comes to fighting climate change, we need to tackle every source of dirty energy while building clear pathways for clean energy to succeed. Today\u2019s energy challenges include a continued global dependence on coal as well as on ever dirtier sources of transportation fuel such as tar sands. In the face of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s interest in business as usual, grappling with climate change requires many people, engaging on many fronts. We can\u2019t fight climate change by nibbling away at the fossil fuel industry -- we need to tackle our dependence on coal, oil and gas head on. So when I hear questions about why fighting the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is a central issue for the environmental community, the answer is easy. The effort to stop the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would bring tar sands from Canada to the Gulf Coast for refining and exporting to overseas markets is a critical piece of the fight to stop expansion of dirty fuels. Keystone XL as a driver of tar sands expansion would be a significant contributor to climate change in its own right. And the fight to defeat Keystone XL has sparked an international debate around when and where to draw the line when it comes to dirty sources of energy. We need limits on carbon pollution from power plants. We need to stop building dirty energy infrastructure such as tar sands pipelines. And we need to ramp up our clean energy choices. The efforts by NRDC and our partners to curb expansion of dirty fuels such as tar sands is a critical step towards a healthy climate and clean energy future.Let\u2019s take a closer look at the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and three simple reasons why it is a critical part of our efforts to curb climate change and build a future with healthier and cleaner energy choices.We cannot continue to green-light dirty energy projects such as Keystone XL that dig the climate hole deeper. The oil industry intends to triple production of tar sands oil in the coming 15 years, which would supercharge growth of what is already Canada\u2019s fastest growing sector of carbon emissions. The effort to stop the Keystone XL pipeline is part of a larger effort to stop expansion of ever dirtier sources of energy such as tar sands. As an individual project, Keystone XL is of particular importance to the tar sands oil industry. It is a lynchpin for tar sands expansion and the accompanying carbon emissions. You can find NRDC\u2019s analysis of Keystone XL, climate and tar sands expansion here.Tar sands expansion is not inevitable and rail is not a magic bullet to replace tar sands pipelines. Fighting for our health and environment is about tackling difficult challenges such as our continued dependence on fossil fuels. We cannot let ourselves get waylaid by industry attempts to undermine our spirit with false claims of \u201cinevitability.\u201d There is no such thing as \u201cinevitable\u201d destruction of the planet if enough of us work together for a better path. And in the case of tar sands expansion, the good news is that people across North America are saying no to the damage caused by tar sands. Farmers in Nebraska are concerned about the damage to their homes and waters from tar sands pipeline leaks. Chicago has had a wake-up call to the dangers of tar sands refining as pet coke piles up causing black dust to force families indoors. Indigenous communities in British Columbia have said no to tar sands pipelines crossing their rivers and oil tankers in their inner coastal waters. And we are not seeing economically viable alternatives to pipelines when it comes to moving tar sands. Rail, which is much in the news now, is unlikely to be more than a niche or stopgap option for tar sands due to a number of factors including cost and infrastructure demands. Instead what we are seeing is that investment in future tar sands projects is shrinking as the oil market in North America changes and the market price of this incredibly expensive to extract substance drops below what is profitable for investors. In fact, a Canadian investment corporation recently found that direct >tar sands foreign investment had dropped from $27 billion a year ago to $2 billion this year.Keystone XL and tar sands expansion is also about Indigenous rights, health, water and forests. It is well documented that the efforts to stop tar sands expansion is about so much more than protecting our climate. Tar sands expansion flies in the face of First Nations efforts to protect their health, waters, lands and way of life. Tar sands strip-mining and drilling is also a scar on the face of the great Boreal forest, threatening wetlands and freshwater resources with tailings waste and leaking pipelines and drill sites. So although, climate change is a major international reason to stop tar sands expansion, there are numerous equally important reasons to find alternatives to dirty energy that affect people and our natural resources.To stop the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline go to www.stoptar.org and to hear additional voices on the need to stop dirty fuels and advance clean energy go to www.demandcleanpower.org."}, {"title": "You Won't Believe How This Kitten Was Rescued (VIDEO)", "text": "This kitty was certainly in the wrong place but luckily, it was the right time. Southern California resident Paula Tiberius noticed a mama cat moving her kittens along her fence. Paula figured the mother was looking for a more secure, sheltered home. Out of curiosity, Paula ventured into her unlocked shed where sure enough she found a small kitten looking back up at her. Paula didn't pick up the kitten right away knowing his mama would be looking for him.Soon after the discovery in the shed, Paula and her family heard a mournful mewing every night. It sounded as though a kitten had made its way into the attic. After another restless night, Paula decided to brave the attic and find the kitten. On her hands and knees, she crawled around unable to find the source of the woeful cries.The sound of the meowing suddenly moved to the first floor wall in the front hall. The meowing continued. The kitten had somehow fallen in between the walls and couldn't get out. He was trapped. Time was ticking for this three-week-old kitten.Paula and her husband, Richard, didn't hesitate. They immediately got to work. Using a jigsaw blade, Richard slowly sawed through the wall. Within minutes, a four-inch square piece of drywall came loose revealing an emaciated and flea infested white and gray kitten. The kitten was worse for wear.The kitten was covered in fleas. His eyes, covered in discharge, could barely open. The number of fleas and amount of blood loss resulted in near anemia. Paula and her sister, Kiry, and daughter, Violet, gave the kitten a needed bath as they carefully hand picked the fleas from his fur. If Paula hadn't been so adamant about finding the meowing kitten, the kitten would not have survived long.Paula called founder of Animal Rescue Alliance and Farm Sanctuary, Kelly Roland, who instructed her to take the kitten to their vet and finally to Petopia, where they would be willing to take the kitten in and find him a happy home.Petopia gives names to all of their rescues. Paula volunteered the name \"Valentino\" for the heart shaped marking on the kitten's head. A fortuitous symbol that this kitten's life is certainly not over and has still so much more love to give.True to his name, Valentino, now Atticus, was lucky a second time. He was adopted from Petopia last December. He is now thriving in his new home.Follow Petopia on Facebook!Do you have a Tail of Hope or Survival? We'd love to hear it!

What can I -- as one caring person -- do in the face of the catastrophic directions of our economy? Forget shorter showers, it said, arguing that municipal and individual water use amounted to only 10 percent of the total consumed. Industry and our political/economic structure are the problem, and by living a low consumption lifestyle, we are assuming the guilt. What's needed is aggressive political change.The latter is certainly true; if we don't change our society, no individual actions will matter. But the first premise is entirely false for several reasons. Individual actions matter because people take the example of others that they respect as a model for their own life. \"Industry\" is making the things that we buy -- if we stop buying, they will stop making and try to ascertain what their consumers want to buy instead. Small things add up; if every household in the United States replaced just one roll of their selection of toilet paper from a brand made by deforesting old-growth forests (yes, many brands are still produced that way) and bought a brand made from \"post consumer\" materials (ie old newspapers; note that \"recycled\" has become a false label), over 400,000 trees are saved. This is a real difference. Now think about how many trees we'd save if every household in the U.S. replaced all of their toilet paper.I am reminded of a parable: A little girl walks down the beach throwing sea stars back into the water. A man approaches and says, \"Why are you wasting your time? This makes no difference.\" The little girl picks up another sea star and throws it in the water, responding, \"it makes a difference to that one.\"Political/economic change is vital; if we don't change the structure of our society, our children are in for a very bad time. Voting is important, protesting is important, changing the government is important. But we live in a very polarized country -- almost half of Americans don't accept the reality of climate change (or other impending environmental catastrophes). Unfortunately, the only thing that will change their minds are their peers (who watch Fox News).Make no mistake, the drastic political overthrow hinted at in the editorial will be met with bullets, and not a few of them. The carbon barons are not going to just forgo their profits because we picket outside their offices, and, as was so shockingly proven during the BP Gulf Spill (by the Coast Guard and local police), the armed services work for them, not for our children. And let's remember that it's not the tree-huggers that have the large caches of arms, it's the reactionaries. So any revolution would probably not come down on the side of peace and conservation.It is a sad thing that probably only a series of major disasters in which many lives are lost and much property damaged will drive the change that is needed, at which time it will be too late.Meanwhile, those of us who realize what is happening, and don't ascribe the signs to \"Acts of God\" have a limited range of actions. Voting is not very effective (between the Electoral College, Citizens United and the very effective redistricting of the last 10 years), nor is protesting, but building an alternate economy will make a difference, and this is done by supporting it with our dollars. So buy your toilet paper made from post-consumer content, get your food as organic and local as you can (urge your local farmer to trade in that gas guzzling pick-up for something more climate friendly) and pray for a miracle."}, {"title": "Hawaii Molasses Scandal: Agency 'Never Got Around' To Warning Matson Of Leaking Pipe", "text": "HONOLULU - On the morning of Sept. 9, people arriving at Honolulu Harbor began noticing fish floating to the surface, lethargic and gasping for air.A murky brown plume was moving through the water. Some people wondered if there had been a sewage spill at one of the piers. The city was doing some work nearby, but the smell just didn\u2019t match.But at noon, an employee of Horizon Lines shipping company thought the air smelled of molasses. The worker notified the Department of Transportation \u2014 the state agency in charge of the harbor.Nearly three hours later, Bob Lamb of Matson Navigation Co. contacted Harbor Operations Supervisor Alan Murakami to say there\u2019d been a spill. Matson is the only company that ships molasses out of Honolulu Harbor.Murakami immediately emailed Randal Leong, an environmental engineer in the DOT Harbor Division, to tell him what he\u2019d just learned. But Leong wasn't surprised.\u201cWe informed Bob that the line had a slow leak some time ago,\u201d Leong said in an email back to Murakami. \u201cApparently they never addressed the leak.\u201dThe fact that both the state and Matson had known about a leaking molasses pipeline for more than a year would quickly become a public embarrassment for the DOT. It turned out the state knew the leak had never been fixed shortly after the spill was reported, but lied to the media and lawmakers about it.DOT officials later said they misled the public because they weren't sure what they were legally allowed to say. Still, the misstep has worked to undermine the credibility of the very state agency that is supposed to oversee shipping. It's also called into question the capabilities of Matson, one of the oldest shipping lines in the state, to conduct a safe operation.Many questions remain about how the public was informed about the spill and its cause.But DOT emails obtained by Civil Beat through a public records request show that the state was largely caught off guard about how to respond to Matson\u2019s 233,000-gallon molasses spill, mostly because there was no contingency plan in place.The documents also reveal a government agency that wanted to protect itself from any liability in what was quickly becoming one of the worse marine disasters in state history.And other internal emails given to Civil Beat also indicate DOT wasn\u2019t necessarily willing to admit that it even knew Matson\u2019s molasses line was leaking. In fact, at least one harbor employee urged his supervisor to \u201ccome clean with the public.\u201dThe Matson molasses spill spotlighted many problems with the state\u2019s oversight of its harbors.Molasses is not considered a hazardous material, such as jet fuel or oil, which require shippers to perform routine inspections and have spill response plans in place.And while hundreds of thousands of gallons of molasses are shipped from Hawaii\u2019s harbors each year, DOT never monitored whether companies inspected or maintained their pipelines.When the 1,400 tons of molasses leaked into Honolulu Harbor on Sept. 9 DOT officials also had no idea who actually owned the pipes or whether it was DOT\u2019s responsibility to maintain the lines or the shipping companies.This became increasingly clear in the days immediately following the spill. DOT officials rushed to figure out whether they were the ones on the hook for the pollution, eventually finding the answer in an amendment to a 1993 lease with Matson that put the company in charge of maintenance and repairs of the pipeline.By Sept. 11, DOT Deputy Directors Randy Grune and Jadine Urasaki \u2014 both cabinet level employees appointed by Gov. Neil Abercrombie \u2014 were notified that the state had no liability based on the lease agreement.But as the days passed and response workers scooped up dead fish and other marine animals, it became apparent the state was at least partially responsible for the spill because it did not follow-up with Matson to make sure the company fixed its leaking pipeline.In July 2012, DOT had sent a letter to Matson informing the company that it had a leak in one of its molasses pipelines. Then in May 2013, just four months before the massive spill, harbor officials again found the same leak in the pipeline while doing a stormwater outfall inspection.Again, Leong was the one to break the news.\u201cPersonnel in the kayak noticed that no repairs to the molasses riser and took some pictures of it,\u201d Leong told told Urasaki in a Sept. 12, 2013 email. \u201cUnfortunately, we never got around to informing Matson of their non-response.\u201dIt's unclear why DOT never made that notification.Despite internal acknowledgement of prior problems with Maton\u2019s molasses pipeline, the company and DOT continued to publicly deny that there had been any indications of trouble.On Sept. 16 when Matson President and CEO Matthew Cox took lawmakers and the media on a tour of the harbor, both he and DOT Director Glenn Okimoto reiterated that they had no prior knowledge of any issues with the pipeline before the spill.Just four days later, however, the state and Matson held a joint press conference admitting they weren\u2019t being truthful. Grune said DOT wasn't sure what information was legally able to be disclosed under attorney client privilege so officials simply didn't tell the truth.But another batch of emails obtained by Civil Beat paints a more complicated picture.On Sept. 12, a contractor who was working with the DOT Harbors Division sent an email to staff and other officials who were involved with the May 2013 stormwater outfall inspection that found Matson's leaking molasses pipeline, telling them not to talk about what they had previously observed.That same contractor, Mark Ambler, of Weston Solutions Inc., had also been involved in the July 2012 incident in which Harbors staff first notified Matson that it had a leaky molasses pipeline.\u201cThis may go without saying, but please redirect any requests/inquiries for comment, media, or information regarding the outfall/pier inspections conducted earlier this year to Randal Leong,\u201d Ambler said in an email with the subject line \u201c05/2013 Outfall Inspections.\u201d\u201cAlso, please maintain confidentiality of any media including photos or videos of the inspections that may be in your possession. If you need to transfer possession of any of these items, please notify Randal.\u201dOne day later, on Sept. 13, Michael Howells, a drafting technician in the Harbors Division emailed his supervisor, Arnold Liu, saying they needed to tell the public what they'd found during those two inspections in July 2012 and May 2013. Howells added that the DOT also needed to explain that the agency didn\u2019t do anything to \u201crectify the situation\u201d except for sending a letter to Matson in 2012.\u201cThis information will get out one way or another and I think we would all prefer to hear it from the DOT administration than an outsider,\u201d Howells said. \u201cWe need to take responsibility for our inaction in the past in order for us to move forward with a clean slate and a new plan. I hope you agree.\u201dOn Sept. 16, another series of emails circulated through DOT\u2019s Harbors Division telling employees to mark any communications about the molasses spill as attorney-client privilege.Under state law, this could keep that information confidential and therefore hidden from the public.\u201cAs you know this topic of the molasses spill has been on-going for a week now and many people are talking about it and asking questions,\u201d said Richard Yoneda, an engineer in the Harbors Division. \u201cEffective immediately, if you receive any e-mails on this topic, do not respond directly. Please forward the e-mail to me and copy Carter Luke and Donna Kalama and include in the email the following words: \u2018Attorney Client Privilege Communication - Do Not Print or Distribute.\u2019\u201dLuke is the head of engineering in DOT\u2019s Harbors Division, and Kalama is a deputy attorney general.She appears to be mentioned in another string of DOT emails between Sept. 11 and Sept. 13 in which Luke asks Urasaki if he should \u201cstart copying Donna to protect docs from discovery.\u201dThe molasses spill remains under investigation by both the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has jurisdiction under the federal Clean Water Act. Matson has also received a subpoena from a federal grand jury.The company has promised to pay for the initial response and clean-up of the spill, but has been vague about just how much it will spend beyond that.Meanwhile, the DOT has asked all businesses that operate pipelines in its harbors to provide the latest inspection reports and spill response plans in an effort to provide more oversight of the state's waterways."}, {"title": "Bringing Wolves Back: Snatching Victory From the Jaws of Defeat", "text": "One of the my most important outdoor experiences was spending a week backpacking on Isle Royale National Park, in Lake Superior, as a teenager. Early one morning, as I sat on the shores of a pond on the island I spotted a gray wolf on the other side of the pond. I swear it looked me in the eye, as we shared in the beauty of the beginning of the day. That wildlife encounter stuck with me, and years later, I knocked on doors to gain support for reintroducing wolves to suitable areas in Colorado.In the mid-1990s, I was the head of a statewide Wyoming conservation organization when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. In Yellowstone, wolves quickly reestablished a natural order to the park, culling out weak deer and elk, and out-competing coyotes. Areas that were once overgrazed by elk and deer recovered and birds, beaver, and other wildlife are bouncing back. The return of the wolf has pumped new tourism dollars into local communities around Yellowstone as people from all over the world come to see and hear wolves in the wild.Unfortunately, the hatred for wolves from a small, yet politically powerful group of western state leaders in Wyoming prompted efforts to establish a state funded wolf bounty, and eventually categorized wolves as essentially \"vermin.\" Such state \"predator\" status means wolves are regarded as pests outside of Yellowstone. No longer protected as an endangered species outside of park boundaries, hundreds have been trapped and shot, ensuring that they will not recover as a viable species in most of the West.  Last June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed no longer protecting gray wolves as an endangered species in the vast majority of the country, threatening any chance of wolves returning to much of their former range. Putting the fate of wolves back into the hands of the western state politicians will not keep them on the road to recovery, but send them down a path to destruction.This is also a critical time for Mexican wolves, the smallest, rarest, southernmost-occurring wolf. Although the Mexican wolf would keep its \"endangered\" status, the Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed changes that could severely limit recovery efforts for this wolf, one of the most endangered animals in North America. Today, there are only about 75 Mexican wolves living in the wild. Education efforts and increased law enforcement throughout the Mexican wolf recovery area are needed to prevent more such killings.If you live our west, you can tell the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in person that wolves must be protection. The agency has rescheduled public hearings to take place on November 19 in Denver, Colorado, November 20 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 22 in Sacramento, California and December 3 in Pinetop, Arizona. Each public hearing will include a short briefing by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and provide the public a chance to give comments as well.And if you can't be there in person, join us in calling for more wolf protections with this online action. Add your voice to the more than 700,000 other Americans who've urged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to hold true to their duty to uphold the spirit of the Endangered Species Act and continue to recover wolf populations to the wild.A few years ago, in Yellowstone, my wife, 8-year old son and 13-year-old daughter watched a pack of wolves close in on a herd of elk in Yellowstone. We shared a spotting scope with a woman from Wisconsin, a family from Spain, and a long-time Wyoming resident. Seeing that pack of wolves stalking a herd of elk, and watching the elk clump together to defend themselves against the pack showed that the laws of nature have been restored to Yellowstone.We must allow the recovery of wolves to continue under the Endangered Species Act; the job is far from done. Bringing back wolves restores predator-prey interactions that preceded humans and shaped the wild special places that we all love today."}, {"title": "Electric 'Fireball' Caught On Video After Montreal Windstorm", "text": "After a powerful windstorm hit parts of southern Quebec on Friday, a resident of Montreal filmed an incredible \"fireball\" of electricity on the power lines outside his house.\"Oh God, here it comes,\" Lachine resident Huw Griffiths says as the bright, crackling surge heads his way.

As households cranked up their electric heaters, the local utility, Arizona Public Service, released additional power onto the grid. But this wasn't the typical power produced by a coal or natural gas power plant. Instead, it came from sunshine captured the day before.As we look to transition our economy to clean, renewable energy, storage will be one of our biggest challenges. To bring more power from solar and wind farms onto the grid, we need to figure out how to store that power when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing.As the New York Times reported on Thursday, a new solar project in Arizona is making big strides toward improving storage capacity. Fifty miles southwest of Phoenix, a three-square-mile stretch of desert has been converted into a sprawling solar farm. Mirrors focus the sun's energy on a series of black pipes. Those pipes carry the heat to tanks of molten salt. The salt then stores the heat, and when the sun goes down, the plant can extract that heat and convert it into electricity.Power plants in the United States account for 40 percent of our nation's carbon pollution. While they churn out the electricity we need to light our homes, they are also sending carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.And that carbon pollution is causing dangerous effects worldwide. All of the 10 hottest years on record were within the past 15 years. Last year, Arctic sea ice shrunk to the lowest size ever observed. And scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have now declared that human-caused climate change helped fuel extreme weather events in 2012.We shouldn't have to choose between having enough electricity and putting our planet and health at risk. We need clean power that helps our economy grow without endangering future generations.Bringing more solar and wind power onto the grid is a critical step, and improving storage technology is already making this possible. But the reality is that our economy is still largely dependent on traditional fuels like coal and natural gas. We need to act now to cut down the carbon pollution spewed into the air when we burn these fuels.That's why the Obama Administration announced a first-ever carbon pollution standard for every new power plant built in America. We already protect our health by limiting emissions of arsenic, mercury, soot, and other air pollution from power plants. Now we can cut down the pollution that is heating our earth and causing sea levels to rise.Already, big polluters and their allies in Congress are trying to block or weaken the new standard. But big corporations shouldn't decide our future--not this time.Write to the EPA and tell them you demand cleaner power and limits to carbon pollution. Transitioning away from our outdated fossil fuel based energy economy is critical for our country's energy future, will make our economy stronger and help tackle climate change while encouraging the necessary innovation to keep our country leading on clean energy."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday: (Vegan) Chocolate Makes Everything Better, and Other Sweet Truths from Fran Costigan", "text": "More than 150 pounds of chocolate, 100 pounds of cocoa powder and 20 years of sweet experience went into \"Vegan Chocolate,\" the new and already bestselling cookbook by pastry goddess Fran Costigan. With tarts and truffles, cookies and creme and shower-stoppers like Sachertorte and Costigan's childhood favorite, Brooklyn Blackout Cake, it's a chocolate orgy that's absolutely plant-based.A classically trained pastry chef gone vegan, Costigan admits, \"Vegan desserts had a bad rep to overcome.\" Rather than suffering through a dusty-tasting carob cube masquerading as a brownie, for a time she shunned all sweets. This did not sit well with her family. Her son announced, \"You're not giving me a baked sweet potato for my birthday. Figure it out.\" She did.\"A beautifully-made vegan chocolate dessert, with high-quality chocolate tastes as good -- or better\" than the same dessert loaded with cream, butter and eggs, says Costigan, who subtitles her book \"Unapologetically Luscious and Decadent Dairy-Free Desserts.\" Turns out all that dairy traditional pastry chefs swear by doesn't do a body good and doesn't help the dessert, either. \"The more fat that's in a recipe, the less intense is the taste of the chocolate.\"Costigan has been the go-to girl for vegan pastry. She baked the wedding cake for Rip Esselstyn (\"The Engine2 Diet\") and the sweet treats for the baby shower of Vegucated's Marisa Miller Wolfson, but for \"Vegan Chocolate,\" she wanted to create recipes doable even if you're not a vegan pastry diva. \"Most of these recipes were brand new, ultimately tested by real people in real kitchens with an ordinary stovetop and oven.\" How does a perfectionist like Costigan know when a recipe's bookworthy? \"When it is unapologetically delicious and works every single time. I want people to have success. I want their desserts to turn out right.\"Meticulous Costigan tried recipes repeatedly, trying different versions, testing how long things stayed fresh, how well they froze. It wasn't all hardship. To perfect recipes, \"you need to taste the chocolate, take nibbles of what you made. It's a treat I enjoy eating every single day.\" So how is it she's willowy, not whale-shaped? \"I didn't eat the whole cake,\" she says. \"When you make something really delicious with real ingredients, your mouth knows it, your brain knows it, your body knows it. You feel satisfied.\"Chocolate is part of her daily diet, but so are soups and kale smoothies. \"The main of my diet is plant-based whole foods.

Costigan's a sought-after instructor at Natural Gourmet Institute  and other plant-based culinary academies and retreats, her pastry classes draw students from as far away as India and Israel, but \"my chocolate classes always sell out first. It's everybody's favorite flavor,\" she says. \"It's emotionally loaded.

But consider the whole picture,\" says Costigan. \"Feeling happy is part of being healthy. I eat chocolate every day and I feel pretty happy.\"Chocolate Olive Oil Glaze for Chocolate-Dipped Anything"}, {"title": "Adapting to Climate Change Does Not Mean Accepting It", "text": "At the end of last week a new IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report was leaked projecting that climate change would reduce the world's food productivity throughout this century. We also saw the Obama administration issue an Executive Order on Climate Preparedness as part of its Climate Action Plan. The Obama Climate Action Plan includes elements to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. This Executive Order focuses specifically on the urgent need to adapt to climate change. The order: \"directs Federal agencies to take a series of steps to make it easier for American communities to strengthen their resilience to extreme weather and prepare for other impacts of climate change.\" The president also:... established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the Administration on how the Federal Government can respond to the needs of communities nationwide that are dealing with the impacts of climate change. The Task Force members include state, local and tribal leaders from across the country who will use their first-hand experiences in building climate preparedness and resilience in their communities to inform their recommendations to the Administration.There is no question that the accumulation of human-created greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has begun to heat the planet and the era of global warming is here. There is also no question that moves such as President Obama's new Executive Order and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's $20 billion Climate Resiliency Plan for New York are necessary responses to the growing impact of climate change. But while these actions are necessary, they are by no means sufficient.Despite the presence of \"know nothing\" deniers of climate science in the United States Congress, the causes of the climate crisis and the solution to that crisis are known and need to be made an urgent priority in the nation's capital. There are several elements to the solution. First and foremost, we must develop a fossil fuel-free, renewable energy economy. This requires massive public and private investment in basic and applied research and similar investment in infrastructure, such as smart grid technology, that would permit the distributed or decentralized generation of energy. It also requires a focused effort on making our homes, businesses and transportation systems more energy efficient than they are today.The effort to encourage renewable energy through a carbon tax or a cap and trade based regulatory system has not yet gained political traction. A traditional command and control system of greenhouse gas regulation has begun, but faces a decade of litigation and the certainty of delay. Environmentalists may stop the Keystone Pipeline only to see the Canadians ship the oil by rail or bucket brigade if necessary. The obvious answer is not to attack fossil fuels by making them more expensive, but to promote renewable energy by making it cheaper and more convenient. The business model should be comparable to how the cell phone replaced land lines or how streaming video has made DVDs obsolete. Make fossil fuels unnecessary and irrelevant.Politics responds to the crisis of the moment. Today, the memory of Hurricane Sandy remains vivid and is a clear force on our political agenda. This is the moment for mobilizing the political world for the changes needed to make our communities strong enough to withstand climate impacts and to rebuild quickly from the damage of extreme weather events. The president's Executive Order is a step in the right direction. But the real work remains.Like others, I see no reason to trust the president and his team with this task. An administration that doesn't seem capable of launching a health care website does not inspire anyone to think they are capable of the far more complex task of transforming the energy base of the economy. Fortunately, the role required of the federal government is modest. Their key role is to fund the basic science and engineering of renewable energy, battery technology, and smart grids. They then will need to provide a revenue stream (new tax) and capital formation strategy (tax law) to stimulate private investment in new energy infrastructure. America's public and private sectors are capable of achieving this transformation, and in the process could create an export industry capable of transforming the world's energy system. Since climate change is a global problem, America cannot solve the climate problem on its own. But we could do much more than we are doing.This plan requires determined, persistent and focused leadership. From time to time, President Obama has demonstrated the potential to become such a leader, but overall his performance has not matched his potential. The focus on climate adaptation with its pessimistic projections of future impacts, assumes that our efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions will largely fail. People are being told not to live near coastlines, and to prepare for a future of flood and famine. (Can the locusts and frogs be far behind?)Projecting the future from current trends is always tricky. At the start of the twentieth century one of New York City's most difficult pollution problems was the presence of horse manure on our streets. In lower Manhattan we were knee deep in the stuff. A few decades later, the internal combustion engine solved that problem (while of course, creating other problems). Climate change is a more difficult problem to understand and solve than horse manure. Horse manure was generated locally and seen and smelled immediately. Even a Tea Party Republican would be unable to deny its cause and effect. By contrast, climate change is caused everywhere and its impact is in the future. It requires more than smell and touch to fully understand.The urban horse manure problem was not solved by making horses more expensive or by eliminating transportation of people and their goods. It was solved by a technological fix. The climate problem and other environmental problems caused by extracting and burning fossil fuels will only be solved when we develop a less expensive and more effective technology to power our economy.Free market advocates may argue that Henry Ford didn't require government's help to build the Model T, but of course he did. Without government there would have been no roads to drive cars on and no ports or railroad lines for shipping the raw materials needed to manufacture cars. Government is needed to build infrastructure and to enforce the rules needed to maintain a level playing field for private competition. The infrastructure needs of the 21st century brain-based economy differ from those required during the Industrial Era, but they remain a key function of government. An ideology that refuses to acknowledge the role of government in the economy makes it difficult for government to do what is needed to facilitate the transformation to a renewable economy. A White House more concerned about politics, policy and image, than management fundamentals only compounds the problem.My view is that the technical breakthroughs needed for this transformation will come. I am counting on human ingenuity coupled with a growing cultural awareness of the need for clean, renewable energy. As early 20th century New Yorkers stepped through the manure in lower Manhattan, they knew that the era of horse-based transportation had reached its limit. Horses worked well in small towns, but created problems in larger cities. We know that a planet with over seven billion people cannot fuel its economy the same way it did when it was as a planet of one or two billion people. We also need to remember that adapting to climate change does not mean that we accept it. We still need to eliminate global warming by reducing the production of greenhouse gases."}, {"title": "Going Public: The American Commonwealth", "text": "In a recent \"woman on the street\" interview on PBS, a run-up to the election for governor in Virginia, the prospective voter repeatedly invoked the phrase, \"the state of our commonwealth.\" Virginia, like three other states, is officially a commonwealth.  Perhaps the woman's phrase is also a sign of the times -- that people are worried about \"the commonwealth,\" in a time of rancorous divisions and a culture of private pursuits. For our nation's founders, commonwealth meant not only popular government but also the public world shared by all, for which all have responsibility.Indeed, one feature of groups like RESULTS and the Citizen Climate Lobby, citizen-based policy efforts which I recently wrote about, is the way they help people move from therapeutic and private questions like \"how do I feel?\" to public ones like \"how can I be effective on an important issue?\" They answer a hunger among the people.Today in America we need a new story in which diverse people can see themselves, countering the false notions that making money, meritocratic success, and other private goods are the only aims in life. The commonwealth is such a story, that needs to be revitalized. Experiences some years ago of house boaters in Seattle who saved their houseboats and helped to birth the environmental movement, offer some lessons.Terry Pettus, a talented journalist and grassroots community organizer, moved to Seattle in the 1920s. Over the next two decades he was a leading figure in many popular movements, from labor organizing to fights for public utilities and old age pensions. Pettus was shaped by the populist politics of the New Deal, a pluralistic politics that birthed the community organizing tradition which later schooled Barack Obama.In the mid-1930s, Pettus helped to organize the Washington Commonwealth Federation, a political group of labor unions, farming communities, cooperatives, small businesses, and neighborhood organizations. By the 1940s, the Commonwealth Federation held a majority of seats in the state legislature.As I noted in my book, Everyday Politics: Reconnecting Citizens and Public Life:\"Pettus and his wife Berta lived in a freewheeling houseboat community on Lake Union, near downtown. Boatyard workers, sailors, students, poor people, and bohemians mingled with retired radicals from the Industrial Workers of the World. Along the shore, speakeasies and brothels were scattered through small shacks and apartments.\"City officials had always disapproved of the community. In 1962 they moved to dismantle the houseboats to make room for high-rise lake-front apartments and other developments. Their complaint against the house boaters was the sewage they dumped in the lake, though the boaters' sewage was a minuscule one half of one percent of the total sewage being dumped.Few thought that the iconoclastic individualists of Lake Union could be organized, but Pettus knew they could. \"People will fight for their existence, if not for abstractions,\" he told me. He and others formed the Floating Homes Association to solidify the community and they tied their concrete self-interest to an ideal to which everyone could relate.Most importantly, they redefined the issue from survival of the houseboats to the meaning of progress. Was the Puget Sound only to become a \"space age\" consumer paradise, symbolized by the Space Needle, or was it a space for a far deeper way of life. \"We knew we could never win if the issue was only the survival of the house boats,\" said Pettus.Drawing on the commonwealth legacy, Pettus and his neighbors portrayed Lake Union as the embodiment of the commonwealth for and by the people of Seattle, \"a gift to us from the Ice Age,\" as he put it. To make the point they turned the complaint against the house boaters for pollution on its head. \"I knew we could never win by debating percentages, claiming 'less responsibility' for pollution than others,\" said Pettus.To the consternation of city officials, house boaters demanded that they be permitted to pay for sewer lines to their boats. The association held workshops on welding pipes and hooking up lines. They gained allies like the city's Health Department.They also organized on multiple levels. House boaters encouraged sympathetic journalists to write articles on the lake and its history in magazines and newspapers. Working with school teachers, they sponsored history tours of the lake. They held neighborhood festivals. They launched an aggressive speaking campaign across the city. They won support from faculty and students in urban planning at the University of Washington.Throughout, their message connected the lake and its history with work, arguing Lake Union always had been a \"working lake,\" built by the people of the city, that had multiple uses: recreation, commerce, residence, as well as a site of beauty and rest, and a place of sacred meaning for native peoples. The organizing effort tapped deep unease about the environment, and gave it shape in a different narrative of \"the good life.\"Thus the fate of the house boats acquired enormous symbolic significance. It became a choice between unreflective consumer culture and the commonwealth.By late 1963, city officials were forced to respond. A city study group called for protection of the lake. The Floating Homes Association was able to block industrial uses, pressing the city to acquire a large area for a public park. The state legislature passed the strongest shoreline management legislation in the country. Pettus, who had been jailed under the Smith Act as a \"subversive\" in the 1950s, helped to write the legislation.The organizing effort had contagion effects which continued for many years. \"Seattle had a major era of citizen participation,\" said James Ellis a prestigious lawyer who was sometimes called \"the informal leader of the city's elite.\" As a result, Ellis believed, \"there was an incredible flowering in the city.\"The lesson of Lake Union remains relevant.Civic revitalization is needed inside institutions and also beyond them, in renewing concern for the shared public world. We need to remember that the American promise is a commonwealth democracy, built and sustained by the labors of all."}, {"title": "A Year After Sandy, Action on Climate", "text": "Last October 29, Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeast with incredible force. It was the largest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, spanning more than 1,100 miles from edge to edge. By the time the rains subsided, at least 117 lives had been lost and hundreds of thousands of homes had been damaged. All told, the storm caused more than $60 billion in damage to our communities. The New York City Office of Management and Budget estimated the total damage to the city to be $19 billion, inclusive of all private, public and indirect costs.When it comes to the debate over global warming, hopefully future generations will look back on Hurricane Sandy as an event that helped break through partisanship and culture war divides to convince the American people that climate change is an urgent threat worth addressing.Global warming made Sandy worse. Warming -- driven by fossil fuel pollution -- has contributed to a rise in sea level in the Northeast of about five inches over the last 60 years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found this doubled the risk of Sandy-scale coastal flooding. Just think of what could happen if sea levels rose by three feet or more -- which is where scientists estimate we could be by the end of this century without action to reduce climate pollution. If we allow that to occur, it won't take a superstorm like Sandy to cause widespread destruction.Coastal areas are not the only locations at risk. The consequences of climate pollution also include greater risk of droughts, more intense rainfall, hotter heat waves, higher levels of air pollution and greater risk of wildfires. At the same time, carbon dioxide pollution is acidifying the ocean, threatening marine ecosystems. These impacts threaten to disrupt agriculture, damage our communities and worsen our health.The more climate pollution we emit, the more serious and potentially irreversible all of these problems will get. Coordinated action to reduce emissions of heat-trapping carbon pollution is urgent if we want to leave a stable climate to future generations. As President Obama said at a speech given in the sweltering heat of this past June at Georgetown University, \"the question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late.\"Fortunately, New York is showing a way forward by strengthening the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) -- a program to limit global warming emissions from power plants. This program has already helped to reduce emissions by more than a third since the program's conception in 2005. Once the new rules are in place, they will lower power plant pollution by an additional 15 percent within the decade. Through 2020, a strengthened RGGI will avoid about 90 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution -- the equivalent of the annual emissions from 16 million cars.RGGI also helps New York make investments in clean energy solutions, like solar energy, wind power and energy efficiency. That helps shift our economy away from fossil fuels and accelerates our progress toward a future without climate pollution.RGGI -- and other clean energy programs across the country -- are making a difference. In 2012, energy-related climate pollution in the United States was at its lowest level in almost 20 years.Governor Cuomo and Jared Snyder, Assistant Commissioner of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, should be commended for their work to support RGGI.But the actions we've taken thus far are clearly not enough to prevent the worst impacts of global warming. New York must do more to limit climate pollution, and the rest of the nation must follow New York's lead.At the federal level, President Obama's proposed limits on carbon pollution from new and existing power plants would be a huge step forward. While we currently protect public health with limits on arsenic, lead, soot and other pollution from power plants, there are no existing federal limits on carbon pollution. Leaders at all levels of government in New York should support the president's action to reduce carbon pollution from power plants.We have an obligation to protect our children and future generations from the impacts of global warming. Let's hope that it won't take another Hurricane Sandy for the nation as a whole to find the courage and the wisdom to act."}, {"title": "Leaked Climate Change Report Predicts Violent, Poorer, Sicker Future - Weather.com Executive Order On Climate Change", "text": "Starvation, poverty, flooding, heat waves, droughts, war and disease already lead to human tragediesRead more on www.weather.com"}, {"title": "Nepal's 'Bird Brother' Seeks To Highlight Conservation Through Shows, 'Crow Conferences'", "text": "By Gopal SharmaKATHMANDU (Reuters) - A young man with a microphone stepped onto a small stage and cawed like a crow. Minutes later, hundreds of noisy birds circled above him, perched on trees and sat on roof tops, astounding the crowd at a show called the \"crow conference\".Gautam Sapkota, fondly known in Nepal as \"charidada\" or \"bird brother\", then made another series of sounds. The crows fell silent before disappearing into the grey sky before dusk.\"I told them to come, sit, be quiet and fly away,\" said Sapkota, a 30-year-old school dropout who has been doing \"crow shows\" at schools since 2005 to entertain students and raise awareness about nature and the conservation of birds.He says he can imitate the sounds of 251 kinds of birds and hopes for recognition of his talents from Guinness World Records. He plans to broaden his conservation message with an album that remixes Nepali songs with the sound of a crane.\"I want to preserve the sounds of birds which may eventually become extinct, by keeping them in recordings,\" he said.Conservationists say 149 of Nepal's 871 bird species face the threat of extinction. Although not considered to be threatened, crows are disappearing fast.Sapkota has given more than 3,200 shows in 66 of Nepal's 75 districts and received an award from the conservation group WWF-Nepal for his efforts.The latest show in the capital Kathmandu coincided with the Hindu festival of crows, which are revered as messengers from heaven and envoys of Baliraja, the king of death.\"As a messenger it gives the sign of anything good that is likely to happen, or anything bad that may strike a family,\" Sapkota said of the crow.But beyond their religious significance, crows are scavengers that help to keep the environment clean.\"These important birds are dying fast because of the use of poison to kill insects and rodents on which they feed,\" said Sushila Chatterjee Nepali, chief of the group Bird Conservation Nepal.Sapkota, who was inspired to mimic birds by a television show, appeared to have left a mark on the crowd.\"I now know why we need to preserve nature and birds,\" Ashish Uprety, a sociology student, said after watching the show. \"I had never seen so many crows before.\"(Editing by John O'Callaghan)"}, {"title": "Sea Shepherd's Pivotal Role Protecting our Oceans", "text": "Last week (October 2013) Captain Paul Watson, founder of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society came home to the U.S. after 15 months at Sea (mostly off the Australian Great Barrier Reef) avoiding Interpol Red Notices by Costa Rica and Japan. It's an extraordinary maritime story about an intrepid eco-warrior - who since 1977 has been involved in direct-action protecting the endangered whales from 'The War Against Nature.'In May of 2012 whilst visiting Germany on route to the Cannes Film Festival, Costa Rica issued a Red Notice for Watson with the intention of handing him over to Japan. Watson skipped bail, making his way through the Netherlands onto the sea, eventually joining the Sea Shepherd fleet in the Southern Ocean to prevent Japan from slaughtering endangered whales in the Antarctic sanctuary.Sea Shepherd has saved 5,000 whales in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary from the lethal Japanese harpoons. Incidentally, Japan sells its Antarctic whale meat for $250,000 a head - do the math - that's $1.25 billion that Sea Shepherd has denied the Japanese government. Is it any small wonder why Japan is after Captain Paul Watson?In the weeks ahead we can expect a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague where Australia argued that Japan's claim to be hunting whales in the Great Southern Ocean for scientific purposes is spurious.Here's an except from my forthcoming book Shepherding the Sea: \"Japan's 'scientific whale research' is overtly flawed. If, in fact, they were testing a hypothesis then their factory boat the Nisshin Maru's reaction to harassment by the Sea Shepherd ships during the 2012-13 whaling season would have ended the research sampling for that season. Instead, the Nisshin Maru fled, followed by one of its catcher boats, to the other side of the Antarctic continent, thousands of kilometers from its designated research area where it resumed harvesting piked whales. A real research program is based upon systematic, pre-planned sampling in a designated area within a designated time frame. Japan's 'lethal research' of rorqual whales in the Antarctic has nothing to do with 'scientific research.'\"Moreover, the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency just released a scathing report documenting Japan's ecocide within its own waters. Japan's bloodthirsty repulsive sense of entitlement clearly knows no bounds. Over the past 70 years Japan has slaughtered one million small-toothed whales, dolphins and porpoises surrounding its tiny island nation. Sadly, these creatures are now toxic - blubber samples consistently contain 85X safe levels of methyl mercury and 140X safe levels of polychlorinated biphenyl's (PCBs).Not only are they driving all cetaceans (whales and dolphins) to extinction, quickly but also according to Elsa Nature Conservancy, Japan \"The government of Japan's stubborn reluctance to relinquish this archaic industry is not only driving marine species to extinction, but endangering the health of its people.\"Furthermore, Japan is capturing dolphins and selling them for as much as $175,000 to dolphinariums burgeoning in China. This is animal cruelty of the highest magnitude and an unimaginable sentence for these sentient remarkable creatures. Just go and see the documentary Blackfish.I recently had the pleasure of spending the morning with Jeff Hansen, Director of Sea Shepherd Australia at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) as he passed through on route to Seattle to defend Captain Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd USA against a SLAPP - a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation - a civil suit launched by the Japanese whalers.Earth Dr Reese Halter with Director Jeff Hansen of Sea Shepherd Australia at Los Angeles International AirportThe Ninth District Court, Seattle will examine non-Americans on Dutch-registered vessels operating out of Australian ports in international waters.Watson says \"Our tactics are non-violent - always have been and in 40 years of operating, I've never caused a single injury to anyone.\"\"Yes we are aggressive but we're non-violent and we only intervene against illegal activities, intervening but making sure that nobody is injured.\"\"They (Japan) can call us all the names they want but in today's modern world if you boycott something you're suddenly a terrorist.\"\"They've taken the meaning out of the word and trivialized it and that's certainly unfortunate for all those who have been victims of real terrorism in the world.\"Watson will challenge Japan's Red Notice in the U.S. if required.Former Australian Green's leader and Chairman of Board of Sea Shepherd Australia Dr Bob Brown, whose is also in Seattle at the Ninth District Court this week, and Jeff Hansen will run 'Operation Relentless' the tenth consecutive year Sea Shepherd has protected the endangered whales in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary.Over the past 200 years humans have massacred five million whales; there's no more than three percent of the great whales remaining. My colleagues have clearly shown that toothed whales cull the old and weak prey preventing diseases from becoming epidemics, and filter feeding or baleen whales fertilize the oceans with their flocculent fecal plumes stimulating phytoplankton thereby enhancing fisheries. It is time now to grant amnesty to all whales and dolphins and end the rapacious global hunt by every remaining country i.e Japan, Norway, Iceland and Danish Faroe Islanders.\"The War Against Nature\" has turned into a prolonged global looting spree. The oceans are dying, rapidly. And as Captain Paul Watson has sagaciously warned \"If the whales die, we die.\"I, for one, love this planet and under no circumstances will sit idly whilst Japan blatantly plunders endangered whales, dolphins, porpoises and other sealife because they exert a sense of entitlement and a largess bank account.The oceans in fact belong to the commons. And whether you realize it or not Sea Shepherd is playing a pivotal role in defending your children's birthrights - our oceans; Sea Shepherd is empowered in doing so by the United Nations World Charter for Nature, which by the way all nations including Japan signed in 1982.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and author of the forthcoming book 'Shepherding the Sea: The Race to Save Our Oceans.'"}, {"title": "Sec. of Interior Jewell's Halloween Speech Praising \"Fracking\" Was Truly Frightening", "text": "You may have seen all the glowing reviews of Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell's Halloween speech trumpeting \"the Administration's vision for conservation that will strengthen our economy and ensure that we pass along our nation's rich legacy to the next generation.\"But watching Secretary Jewell's National Press Club speech during the \"live\" video feed and then reading the \"prepared remarks\" issued by the Interior department to the media, it was clear why there were so many glowing press reports: They were based on the official prepared remarks, not what Jewell actually said during the speech.What's more, the official transcript leaves out her Q&A session after the speech - luckily included in the archived video - when Jewell's true oil and gas alliances were revealed.In an email blast the day after the speech, the former petroleum engineer, turned commercial banker, turned outdoor recreation industry executive at REI, Jewell wrote: \"President Obama and I believe that we have a moral obligation to the next generation to leave our land, water, and wildlife better than we found it. At Interior, we are already playing an important role in fulfilling this mission - particularly during this time when our natural resources are facing unprecedented challenges from climate change and a growing population.\"Part of this \"moral obligation to the next generation\" is focusing on a \"landscape-level planning approach,\" a re-accruing theme in the Jewell's speech and the Q&A session. Apparently the Secretary of the Interior thinks the only thing American's care about is how good their public landscape looks on the surface, not how healthy it actually is beneath the surface.\"I know where President Obama stands,\" according to the official transcript of Jewell's speech. \"The President believes that we have a moral obligation to the next generation to leave our land, water, and wildlife better than we found it. That's why he launched the America's Great Outdoors program in 2010. That's why he's taking comprehensive action to cut carbon pollution and to slow the effects of climate change. And that's why he has used his authority time and time again to protect some of the places that Americans love most.\"Sounds great.Unfortunately, most reporters relied on the official transcript, rather the actual speech, so they missed Jewell's pro-drilling attitude.In the milk-toast transcript version she mentions that the \"balanced approach to development is especially what we need as we explore new frontiers in the Arctic, as we implement onshore leasing reforms, or as we experience an energy boom in the Bakken Region in North Dakota.\"Again, sounds great.But then she goes off-script in the actual speech to talk about her trip to North Dakota, where \"I learned a lot about how companies were directionally drilling and have a smaller footprint on the land than the drilling methods that were used when I was in the industry.\"There's that smaller footprint \"landscape-level approach\" theme again. In fact, she took the opportunity to announce her first Secretarial Order \"to ensure that whenever our public lands or resources are impacted by development activity, that we are also considering how to mitigate those impacts at a landscape level through strategic conservation and restoration.\"According to the \"prepared remarks,\" Jewell was suppose to say that the Secretarial Order \"will help Interior create a simpler, more straightforward approach for businesses to be good partners and good stewards of our public lands. Project proponents will be able to invest with certainty and clarity in their projects and support the region's environmental needs, rather than ad-hoc, project-by-project mitigation efforts.\"Compare that to what she actually said during the speech:\"We're also considering how to mitigate these impacts and a landscape level through strategic conservation and restoration. So as a business person, I appreciate that there is an important role for government to oversee how our lands are developed. We rely, as business people, on government making those kinds of choices. I also know that there is nothing more frustrating than to be well into an investment and find your investment challenged. It gives you uncertainty, it results often times in costly delays and perhaps lawsuits. But by understanding our landscapes and guiding developments to the areas of highest resource value and lowest environmental concerns, we can reduce the likelihood of conflict. We can help businesses drive a more predictable return on investment, and that's what they're looking for.\"Finally, several \"bears-pooping-in-the-wilderness\" jokes later (Yea, you missed those in the transcript too), the moderator of the Q&A session popped the \"F\" question: \"Thirteen percent of all oil drilling and fracking is done on BLM land right now. Will that number rise in the future?\"\"I'm going to talk about fracking for a second because I've fracked wells before,\" said Jewell, continuing to explain:\"Fracking has been an important tool in the toolbox for oil and gas for over 50 years. And some of the new techniques that are being used actually reduce the amount of foot print on the surface acreage in order to recover oil and gas from a much larger area, so this is an important tool. But it has to be done safely and responsibly. BLM is working on regulations that some of you are aware of.We have a number of opportunities to continue to develop oil and gas on BLM lands and we will continue to see that happen. So if you take the example I used earlier of the national petroleum reserve in Alaska, you want to make sure you minimize the surface impact for a whole variety of reasons - species migration, sensitive ecosystem, permafrost, all of those kinds of things.By using directional drilling and fracking, they have an opportunity to have a softer footprint on the land. But there's a lot of acreage that the BLM has that will be developed, so the short answer to your question is we'll likely do more because we'll be releasing more land to do it, but we're going to do it in a safe and responsible way.\"  Maybe it's just me, but she should have skipped Halloween and saved her \"prepared remarks\" for April Fool's Day, especially the part where she says: \"The real test of whether you support conservation is not what you say in a press conference when the cameras are rolling.\"So true, but the cameras are also rolling during the Q&A sessions."}, {"title": "Federal Pipeline Regulatory Body Re-Opens Line Causing Biggest Fracked Oil Spill in US History", "text": "Cross-Posted from DeSmogBlogA month after over 865,200 gallons of oil spilled from Tesoro Logistics' 6-inch pipeline near Tioga, North Dakota, the cause of the leak is still largely unknown to anyone but Tesoro. The pipeline resumed operations today.Carrying oil obtained via hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"), the controversial horizontal drilling method used to capture oil and gas found embedded in shale rock basins worldwide, the Bakken Shale pipeline spill on September 29 was the largest fracked oil spill in U.S. history. Oil spill experts say the spill may be even bigger than originally estimated.Yet few details of what caused the spill - and how to prevent it from happening again - have arisen in the month since it occurred.The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) believes a lightning strike may have created the quarter inch hole in the pipeline, leading to the spill.PHMSA says it will carry out a rigorous investigation into the cause of the spill, but allowed the restart after Tesoro agreed to the agency's safety order mandating aerial monitoring of the pipeline over the next three days during the restart and then weekly for the next year, along with 20 other things.The safety order also mandates Tesoro provide a documented updated within six months indicating how it enhanced its control room monitoring, instructs Tesoro to finish the final mechanical and metallurgical testing report of the failed pipe within 30 days and dictates that within \"90 days complet[ion of] a root cause failure analysis for the Line that contains a detailed timeline of events.\"Documents obtained by Greenpeace USA under North Dakota's Open Records Statute show the oil has settled over 12 feet below the ground layer of the soil. The oil that settled on the surface was burned off.\"At 10-12 feet below surface, there is a extensive clay layer that underlies the entire hill top,\" Kris Roberts, Environmental Response Team Leader for the North Department of Health's Division of Water Quality, explained in an October 3 field report.In an interview with DeSmogBlog, Roberts said studies to test the impacts of the massive amounts of oil on the area's soil are forthcoming.\"There will be a lot of testing done after the process of cleaning it up,\" he said. \"For now, it's kind of a moot point when you've got product moving through the soil, it's kind of screwed up. So, there will be sampling that happens as we work toward different options toward remediating the contamination.\"Rather than rush to clean up the soil now, though, the North Dakota Department of Health plans on \"putting it to bed for the winter\" and finishing up in the spring, Roberts said.\"We'll continue to recover any free oil, but essentially because winter is days away if not already there, they're basically just putting it back to bed, ensuring it's properly contained and monitored,\" he said.\"They will hopefully get some natural remediation over the winter below the frost zone when the indigenous bacteria start flourishing, that'll probably help a little bit cleaning up. But for the most part, everything is pretty much on hold and active remediation is going to be on hold until next spring.\"Below are some of the photos provided to Greenpeace USA as part of its Open Records request.They include a photo of the oil burn, which Tesoro did the day after the spill upon getting permission to do so from the North Dakota Department of Health; as well as aerial and on-the-ground photos of the scene of the spill site.Stay tuned for DeSmogBlog's continuing coverage on North Dakota's massive Bakken Shale fracked oil spill in the days and weeks ahead.A photo of the in situ burning of oil from a distance; Photo Credit: Greenpeace USAOver 865,000 Gallons of Fracked Oil in the Soil; Photo Credit: Greenpeace USAA birds-eye view of the 865,000 gallon spill of fracked oil in Tioga, ND; Photo Credit: Greenpeace USA"}, {"title": "Rules of the Road Needed for North American Energy", "text": "On Oct. 8, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) and Rep. Gene Green (D-TX) introduced H.R. 3301, a bipartisan bill to make integrated North American energy infrastructure a reality. Without the certainty of law, America and our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, cannot realize a truly integrated North American marketplace and the United States cannot exercise its new found energy muscle in the global energy marketplace.At present, there is no US authorizing statute governing cross border crossings of energy infrastructure, such as pipelines and transmission lines. A one page Executive Order governs the process, and it is characterized as the \"Presidential Permit Process.\" Unfortunately, there is little guidance on what is subject to review and what is exempt. Thus, every new application or technical change (e.g. intra-company transfer, name change, etc.) becomes a one-off, entirely subjective examination. The result of the lack of clear guidance is uncertainty and delay.The Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on Oct. 29 on the state of the existing \"process\" (or lack thereof). The hearing did not focus on the Keystone XL pipeline -- the most famous issue involving the \"Presidential Permit Process\" -- but rather on the broader question of how all types of cross-boarder energy infrastructure projects should be dealt with in the future.While delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has garnered widespread pubic attention, there are many other Presidential Permit applications pending at the State Department. Many of these applications are simple changes of ownership filings with no impact on the pipeline's operations or border-crossing status. And yet even these face lengthy delays; it is not unusual to see approvals delayed for five years or more.H.R. 3301, the North American Infrastructure Act, would address this issue by consolidating and standardizing the cross-border approval process for oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and electric transmission lines. The bill would replace and supersede the current processes that have been created in an ad hoc fashion through multiple Executive Orders.The bill does not waive any environmental laws, and applicable permits would still be required. It instructs that all applications for cross-border oil pipelines be handled by the Department of Commerce, natural gas pipelines by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and electric transmission lines by the Department of Energy. And it requires agencies to approve cross-border applications within 120 days of submission unless they determine the project is not in the national security interest of the United States.To address existing projects with Presidential Permits, it specifies that existing projects do not need further approvals, including new or revised Presidential Permits, for modifications such as reversal of flow direction, volume expansion or adjustments to maintain flow or in cases of changes in ownership.With new North American resource abundance, we have the opportunity to better control our destiny and move to greater independence. But we cannot hope to do that without a robust integrated North American energy marketplace."}, {"title": "The Digital Life", "text": "Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that before mid-century the exponential acceleration of information technologies, robotics, medical science, and artificial intelligence will result in a \"singularity\", a point at which humans will essentially merge with their technology. Such an event may seem implausible, but discoveries of how technology and humans really interact are being made every day, leading one to the conclusion that it's not an unimaginable future -- and it may be the key to sustainable living on an increasingly overcrowded planet.Heart pacemakers and artificial hips already demonstrate the seeds of Kurzweil's vision and innovations like Google Glass will get more real time information a lot closer to us very soon. But could we use such technology to measure what our bodies actually need and then design foods and homes that maximize our limited resources to sustain a growing population?The U.S. Department of Defense has been working on these ideas since 2008 at its National Center for Telehealth and Technology, introducing wearable sensors that report to smartphones on a user's health and wellness. Called \"BioZen\", the system shows real-time data from the heart, respiration, skin responses, temperature, blood chemistry, and brain waves. The data is used to determine what medicine or nutrition might be needed by the soldier in the field or by the returning veteran undergoing rehabilitation.Dozens of companies all over the globe are working on various versions of BioZen, bringing down cost, increasing functionality, and improving the analytics. These technologies can make limited health care dollars go a lot farther by preventing illness or by identifying and treating conditions much earlier. Using the same technology to monitor our nutritional needs, and the actual value of the foods we consume, will fundamentally change the way we grow, process, and deliver food to consumers in the future.Another example of taking a cue from our bodies and improving the technology to meet those demands comes from NASA. Astronauts in the International Space Station go through a 24-hour day of light and dark every ninety minutes. Not surprisingly, their sleep is disrupted and productivity is impacted, so high-tech lights are tuned to mimic natural daylight, stimulating alertness. At \"night\", when light may be needed for performing some tasks, but astronauts want to avoid stimulation that inhibits sleep, special lights filter out certain wavelengths for a more restful environment.Florida-based Lighting Science Group, which designed these lights for NASA, has brought the technology to earth with its Definity Digital light bulbs that give you the choice of being alert or promoting sleep (disclosure: I was so impressed by the company, I invested in their stock). A growing number of studies highlight this problem on earth, where we spend hours before bedtime illuminated by computer screens, TVs, and other lights that make us more alert at precisely the time we want to start decompressing and getting ready for restful sleep. By combining things like BioZen sensors and Definity lights in the future, the body could send signals to tune lights for our bodies' needs making us more productive and healthy.And lest you think that these developments are the sole domain of science fiction or risky Silicon Valley venture capitalists, tech giant Qualcomm is sponsoring a $10 million Tricorder XPRIZE competition to stimulate more innovation in the \"integration of precision diagnostic technologies, making definitive health assessment available directly...on a consumer's mobile device...thus making healthcare more convenient, affordable, and accessible. The winner will be the team that most accurately diagnoses a set of diseases independent of a healthcare professional or facility and that provides the best consumer user experience.\"The \"singularity\" event when Man and machine merge may actually be more of a series of \"multiplicity\" events that collectively make better use of scientific discovery and information technology, but either way, our lives are about to evolve from a horse-and-buggy era to truly digital in exciting ways that can make us healthier and more sustainable for the foreseeable future."}, {"title": "Oil & Gas Talking Points Start to Unravel", "text": "Colorado Public Radio's Ryan Warner and ProPublica's Abrahm Lustgarten fact checked a new set of ads sponsored by Coloradans for Responsible Energy Developments.

I've traveled all over the east coast speaking at colleges, including  Brown university who's board recently decided not to divest from coal. I really hope the students there who listened to me talk about the realities of living in a community of extraction will continue pressuring their institution to do the right thing. After my tour of a few colleges where I spoke and raised awareness about the coal issues in my home state I went to Powershift.For those who are unfamiliar, Powershift is a conference of a few thousand college students who are interested in climate change or extraction issues. It's a pretty good platform for people on the front lines of fights against whatever extractive industries are poisoning them and their community to raise awareness and support, as well as recruit volunteers and interns. At least that's what it should be for, but from my perspective, and the perspectives of other people on the front lines of extraction it was an event for big green organizations to co-opt the struggles of people from marginalized communities. I mean, sure there were a few token panels and discussions on the front line fights against extraction, but many of them were scheduled at the exact same time.After Powershift, I returned to West Virginia to set up and get ready for the Mountain Justice fall summit, which was held at the Coal River Mountain Watch volunteer house in the heart of the Coal River valley. We raised huge tents, got the wood stoves going inside them, set up a security station at the end of the drive way, got the outhouses in working order, as well as numerous other things to get ready for almost two-hundred people camping in our yard. I was particularly nervous because at this same event and location last year we were harassed by coal industry supporters who called me out by name and threatened my family. This year though, we only got a few honks. It seems that industry folks prefer more covert and underhanded tactics nowadays, like attempted murder. The fall summit went off without a hitch though, and we took almost everyone there up to the top of Kayford mountain to let them see first hand the destruction of surface mining.me, at the fall summitYou might be thinking to yourself now \"Dang!, why didn't I know about the fall summit before hand so I could go?\" To that I say sorry, but maybe next year. Also, I'd say that my friends at Hands-off Appalachia are having an action camp in Connecticut that starts November 19th.

The parasite is only on its gills, which come off when the head is removed for human consumption.A shrimp company operator in Florida said she had not seen black gill disease there this year.\"We have seen it in the past in Florida, but it's when the shrimp in Georgia have moved down,\" said Marilyn Solorzano, who operates Miss Marilyn Louise Shrimp Co. on the St. Johns River in Jacksonville.\"There haven't been enough shrimp in Georgia this year to move down to Florida,\" she said.Researchers in Georgia are studying the life cycle of the parasite that causes black gill disease in hopes of finding a way to combat it, Geer said.Officials blamed drought for earlier outbreaks in the last decade, but this year the U.S. Southeast saw record rainfall.Too much rain changed water salinity and upset the delicate balance of salt and fresh water in the creeks where shrimp grow up, Bell said.\"When the shrimp are stressed, they're susceptible to being infected with the parasite,\" he said.Wildlife agency officials in Georgia will meet with the state's shrimp association this month to determine just how bad the crop has been.If data indicate a major decline, Georgia will apply for relief funds from the National Marine Fisheries Service, Geer said.South Carolina officials have not determined whether to seek disaster relief, Bell said.Tommy Edwards, a veteran shrimper in Charleston, said he is barely getting by.\"I'm not making any money,\" said Edwards, 52. \"Normally, we have enough money where we're set for the winter and repairs and so forth, but we don't have enough for a month's worth of bills.\"Black gill disease tends to taper off as waters get colder in November, officials said.

When a cloudburst hit the state in June 2013, the choked rivers were unable to cope with the ravaging floods. Flashfloods washed away hundreds of buildings, bridges and dams, claimed more than 5,000 lives and caused an estimated damage of $50 billion.Climate change will bring more extreme weather events such as droughts and the cloudburst experienced in Uttarakhand. Healthy rivers and their floodplains act as natural buffers that protect us from the worst vagaries of a changing climate. Free-flowing rivers build the deltas and mangrove belts that protect our coastlines, preserve fisheries and forests, and recharge the groundwater reserves that sustain our water supply and agriculture. Floodplains, marshes, dunes, reefs and mangrove forests -- often referred to as green infrastructure or bioshields -- are vital to making our societies more climate resilient.Climate change is water change. Learning from earlier flood disasters and preparing for climate change, governments, scientists and environmental organizations have started to remove levees and recreate floodplains on rivers such as the Rhine, the lower Yangtze and the lower Danube. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is being promoted by forward-looking tools such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the UNECE Water Convention.In spite of positive approaches rivers, the arteries of our planet, are under mounting pressure around the world. More than 60 percent of the world's major rivers have been fragmented. Freshwater ecosystems face higher risks of species extinction than any other major ecosystem. Even so, China, South and Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America are currently experiencing unprecedented dam-building booms. Ironically, the infrastructure built today not only weakens the climate resilience of riverine ecosystems, but is in itself highly vulnerable to a changing climate.Parineeta Dandekar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People warns: \"Dammed rivers are damaged rivers; they are less able to protect us from climate change and more likely to worsen problems when big floods and droughts hit. We need honest and holistic cost-benefit analysis of dams to account for these climate change risks.\"A new report published by International Rivers offers guidance on how to strengthen climate resilience in the water and energy sectors. The guide explains how rivers act as natural climate buffers, how large dams increase the vulnerability to climate change, and how climate resilience can be integrated into water resource management and infrastructure planning. It was prepared with input from experts and partner organizations, and is addressed at civil society organizations. The new publication, which was written by Katy Yan and Lori Pottinger, includes a lot of concrete cases studies and practical advice for groups working in the water and energy sectors and confronted by dam projects.John Matthews of Conservation International, one of the advisors to the new guide, comments: \"Ecologically poorly designed water infrastructure is likely to reduce the inherent resilience and adaptive capacity of [developing] nations' ecosystems, permanently altering lakes, rivers, soils, and fisheries. Climate-infrastructure mismatches may actually make poor nations even poorer.\"The new report equips civil society groups to advocate for infrastructure investments that strengthen rather than weaken the climate resilience of ecosystems and human societies. It will be complemented by a video, and used for civil society training workshops on climate resilience in different parts of the world.

He unsealed a legal document that could underscore the island's courtroom defense of Bill 2491 if the county has to defend it from legal challenges threatened by the biotech industry.The document offers the county attorney's assessment of the legal challenges facing the bill. Releasing the document, supporters of the bill say, amounts to leaking a possible roadmap to the county's legal strategy in case the biotech industry follows through on threats to sue.The county counsel would represent the county in possible legal proceedings. Critics say that the mayor released information that jeopardizes the county's chances of winning a court battle.Andrea Brower, a key supporter of the bill, said in a written statement Friday that the mayor's action is \"a double betrayal.\"The polemic bill would require biotech companies to disclose details about pesticide use and farmers to tell the county if they are growing genetically altered crops, and violators can face fines or jail time.The Kauai County Council, which voted 6 to 1 last month to pass the bill, will likely move to override the mayor's veto.Beth Tokioka, a spokeswoman for the mayor, defended Carvalho's decision to declassify the document, noting it's best to be forthcoming with the public about the bill's legal challenges.\"The mayor has the right to waive the attorney-client privilege if he feels it\u2019s in the best interest of all involved,\" Tokioka said by email. \"In this instance he has chosen to do so, feeling that with such a contentious issue, the key to finding consensus is through an overabundance of information. He wishes to be as transparent as possible.\"Deputy County Attorney Mauna Kea Trask's 66-page legal opinion to the mayor details a number of areas where the county may be on shaky legal ground if the legislation becomes law.In particular, there's a \"strong likelihood\" that a court would rule that the county overstepped federal and state laws, according to the opinion. There are also legal questions about whether the county council has the power to assign new functions to a county department that were not initiated by the mayor, whether the bill is an invalid exercise of police power, and whether it violates state law that forbids officials from declaring farming operations a nuisance.The \"county attorney's office concludes that there are many legal challenges facing Bill 2491,\" writes Trask.By contrast, prominent environmental attorneys released a statement last month saying that Bill 2491 was sound and urging council members not to be swayed by threats from the biotech industry.Earthjustice attorney Paul Achitoff, one of the lawyers who signed the statement, told Civil Beat on Friday that the mayor's decision to release the legal analysis was \"nuts.\"\"It gave him more political cover,\" said Achitoff. \"But that is self-interested. That is saying, 'I'm putting my own political career ahead of the interest of the county,' which is now in an awkward position because if this veto is overridden and the industry sues you have this document out there that the county now has to deal with in litigation.\"Earthjustice has offered to represent community groups that may intervene in potential lawsuits between the county and the biotech industry.The mayor's decision to release the legal analysis contrasts with an earlier vote by the county council to keep such information confidential. Last month, the county council voted 5 to 2 to keep a similar county attorney's office analysis sealed.\"In court, the process is an adversarial one, so you don't disclose your strategies or information to the other side,\" said Councilwoman JoAnn Yukimura at the time. \"So if we are going to court to defend Bill 2491, as is a possibility, then it's in my opinion and usually counsel will advise as such, that we do not reveal our hand.\"Syngenta attorney Paul Alston noted that the biotech industry had made public its own 40-page memorandum on what it believed to be legal flaws in the bill and said that it made sense for the county attorney's office to do the same.\"Then people interested in seriously studying the issues, instead of just offering soundbites or doing a very superficial review of the legal issues could have a serious debate about those things,\" he said.In addition to new pesticide and GMO disclosure requirements, Bill 2491 also requires the county to conduct studies on the potential health and environmental harms associated with pesticide spraying. And it requires buffer zones between biotech fields where pesticides are being sprayed and public spaces, including schools, parks and hospitals."}, {"title": "'Frack Check' Videos Blast Claims Made By Colorado Oil And Gas Industry", "text": "An anti-fracking group in Colorado has released a series of ads blasting claims made by the oil and gas industry in the state as four communities prepare to vote on bans or moratoriums on drilling and fracking in their regions.Fort Collins, Broomfield and Boulder voters all face ballot initiatives that would put a moratorium on fracking and drilling inside city limits for five years. Lafayette voters will consider a measure that, if passed, would amend the city charter with a community bill of rights -- one that would make it illegal for any person or company to drill for oil and gas within the city limits.Released by Frack Free Colorado and called \"Frack Check\", the videos offer counterpoints to the industry's drilling safety claims.In one video (watch above), Weston Wilson, an EPA whistleblower who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for 37 years, talks about the threat of groundwater contamination due to fracking. He cites a leaked EPA powerpoint slideshow from August, one that Wilson says reveals a clear link between fracking and groundwater contamination in Pennsylvania.\"The presentation concludes that the methane and other gasses released during drilling caused significant damage to the water quality there,\" Wilson says in the video. \"Charges from that leaked document shows that wells being fracked for gas create pathways that allow gas to migrate to shallow aquifers.\"Wilson also points to a Duke University study that found drinking water wells near fracking sites have 17-times more methane than those wells that are farther away.\"This EPA report backs up other studies like the one done by Duke University that found drinking water wells near fracking sites have 17 times more methane than those wells that are farther away.\"\"It's now clear that EPA had prior knowledge that fracking does cause contamination of groundwater and contaminate the air we breathe,\" Wilson concludes.In the second video (below), Anthony Ingraffea, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University who has also served as a oil and gas industry consultant for more than 25 years, talks about how much fracking has changed over the years (story continues below video):\"The gas industry is going to tell anybody who is going to listen that fracking has been around since 1947,\" Ingraffea says in the video. \"Saying that fracking has been around since 1947 and shouldn't be of concern now is pretty misleading. Fracking has changed tremendously in the last 65 years as have many industries. For instance, in 1947 a frack job would consist of about 1000 gallons of water or napalm going into a single well. Today fracking for shale gas or shale oil can involve 10 or more wells on one pad and collectively consuming over 50 million gallons of water and chemicals.\"Hydraulic fracturing is a controversial process of injecting water, sand, and chemicals underground at very high pressures to release natural gas. Most companies however have declined to reveal what components make up their fracking fluids, calling them \"trade secrets.\"It has been less than a year since Gov. John Hickenlooper said that the state would sue any city in Colorado that bans fracking and only a few months since the state filed its first lawsuit against Longmont's drilling rules.The push in the four communities follows a surge in drilling around the state which has become home to a total of more than 51,000 operating oil and gas drill sites. A recent report from advocacy group Environment America reported that Colorado is the second-highest fracked state in the U.S. with 18,168 fracking wells, second only to Texas.\"Colorado has been called the ground zero of fracking,\" Ana Tinsly, spokesperson for Frack Free Colorado, said in a press statement. \"Gas and oil companies are virtually self-regulated, with devastating consequences, as we saw in the recent flooding of thousands of fracking sites that were allowed to be built on a flood zone. Governor Hickenlooper, in fact, is such a supporter, he once claimed to have drunk fracking fluid.\"Tinsley refers to controversial testimony Hickenlooper gave to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources back in February.\"You can drink it. We did drink it around the table, almost ritual-like, in a funny way,\" Hickenlooper said, The Washington Times reported.Last year when Hickenlooper was invited to give the keynote address at The Atlantic's Next Generation Energy Forum, he vigorously defended the practice and even went so far as to say that the anxiety about fracking \"isn't directly connected to the facts.\"\"There's a lot of anxiety out there, certainly with hydraulic fracturing and the kind of unorthodox technologies for the extraction of natural gas, but oftentimes that anxiety isn't directly connected to facts,\" Hickenlooper said during the forum."}, {"title": "White Nose Syndrome, Bat-Killing Fungus, Is All But Invincible, Study Finds", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon:As the weather cools and bats across North America prepare to hibernate, a new study sheds light on the mysterious monster that will haunt them in their sleep. Much like Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and other Halloween villains, the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats is ridiculously difficult to kill, researchers report.  That fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has killed around 6 million American bats since its debut in a single New York cave seven years ago. It now infects 22 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, decimating entire bat colonies with a mortality rate of nearly 100 percent. And according to a new study published in the journal PLOS One, P. destructans is a flexible fiend whose survival doesn't hinge on the bats it massacres.  \"It can basically live on any complex carbon source, which encompasses insects, undigested insect parts in guano, wood, dead fungi and cave fish,\" says lead author and University of Illinois grad student Daniel Raudabaugh in a press release. \"We looked at all the different nitrogen sources and found that basically it can grow on all of them.\"  This adaptable diet is made possible by enzymes that break down urea and other proteins, producing highly alkaline conditions that can burn holes in skin and leave bats vulnerable to further infection. \"P. destructans appears to create an environment that should degrade the structure of keratin, the main protein in skin,\" Raudabaugh says. It can also survive on other proteins and lipids in bats' skin and bodily fluids, the study shows.  While previous studies have examined the fungus's genome and its effects on bats, this is the first in-depth look at its basic biology, according to Andrew Miller, a mycologist for the Illinois Natural History Survey who helped direct Raudabaugh's research. \"Dan found that P. destructans can live perfectly happily off the remains of most organisms that co-inhabit the caves with the bats,\" Miller says. \"This means that whether the bats are there or not, it's going to be in the caves for a very long time.\"A bat skull lies on the floor of Mt. Aeolus Cave in Vermont. (Photo: Ann Froschauer/USFWS)Heat is one of the few silver bullets for the cold-loving fungus, which only manages to infect warm-blooded bats because hibernation decreases their body temperatures. But since artificially heating thousands of bat caves across the continent isn't a practical solution, scientists are searching for other ways to control the disease's rapid spread.  The fungus does struggle in extremely acidic conditions, Raudabaugh notes, but otherwise tolerates a \"very wide range of pH\" as well as high calcium levels, inhibitory sulfur compounds and other naturally occurring hurdles. Its only significant weakness, aside from temperatures above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, seems to be the way it drinks water, he says.  P. destructans' cells are leaky, making it hard for them to absorb water from dry wood and other surfaces that cling to moisture. But the fungus has apparently solved that problem, since it can draw up water more easily in the presence of degraded fats or free fatty acids \u2014 both of which occur on the skin of living and dead animals, including bats.A map showing the spread of white-nose syndrome since 2006. (Image: whitenosesyndrome.org)The fungus is thought to be an invader from Europe, where native bats are relatively immune to similar species of cave-dwelling fungi. Scientists say it probably hitched a ride across the Atlantic on the shoes, clothing or equipment of unwitting spelunkers, who may have inadvertently helped it invade a continent full of defenseless bats.  It remains unclear exactly how P. destructans kills bats, but it seems to wake them up too early from hibernation, leaving them to search fruitlessly for insects in the dead of winter. Aside from damaged skin and the characteristic white fuzz on their noses, ears and wings, many infected bats are found with empty stomachs, suggesting they starved to death.  \"All in all, the news for hibernating bats in the U.S. is pretty grim,\" Miller says. That won't stop the quest to save American bats, though, which play important economic as well as ecological roles. Insect-eating bats keep a variety of disease-spreading and crop-killing insects in check, saving the U.S. agriculture industry an estimated $3 billion per year.  Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service recently discovered the closest relative of P. destructans that doesn't cause disease, offering hope that science might find a way to defang the fungus. \"Identification of the closest known relatives of this fungus makes it possible to move forward with genetic work to examine the molecular toolbox this fungus uses to kill bats,\" USFS researcher Daniel Lindner said earlier this year. \"Ultimately, we hope to use this information to interrupt the ability of this fungus to cause disease.\""}, {"title": "Squirrelus Interruptus: 5 Things Shut Down By Squirrels", "text": "What does it take to bring a nuclear weapons site to its knees?

A few items particularly caught my attention.  First, she announced that her department will quickly adopt consistent policies and procedures on using mitigation at a landscape scale in the siting of energy and other infrastructure on public lands.This may sound like \"government speak,\" but it really signals an important step. It recognizes nature as one of America's most valuable assets, and reflects the kind of constructive, solution-oriented approach to government decision-making needed to get us to an environmentally sound and prosperous future.\"Mitigation\" is not mysterious. It simply means taking reasonable steps to avoid harm to our natural resources, reducing that harm as much as possible if it can't be avoided and compensating for any harm that remains.We strongly support this approach, and I congratulate Secretary Jewell for her initiative.Mitigation, fairly and properly used, is a practical, efficient and very effective way of better reconciling our country's economic and environmental goals and of achieving the conservation of important natural resources at a large scale.America's population and our economy are both growing, and we need appropriate, efficient and effective development to support that growth. We also need to protect our natural resources to maintain our quality of life and ensure that our children and grandchildren will have the fortune of living in a prosperous, beautiful and healthy nation.Those are not \"either/or\" choices; if we are smart and work together, we can do both. Proper and consistent use of mitigation is one of the keys to doing that.Companies are also increasingly interested in mitigation as a strategy. It saves them time and money and reduces uncertainty, permitting delays, and the risk of litigation. This is especially true if it is approached at the landscape scale, focuses first and foremost on avoidance, and is considered in a collaborative manner very early on in the development process.Applying mitigation at a landscape scale is particularly smart because it allows more effective engagement with state and local governments and helps avoid of the loss of key natural resources with multiple recreational, environmental and other public benefits. When compensation is needed despite efforts to avoid and minimize harm, a landscape approach helps ensure that the compensation is both effective and lasting.We encourage the secretary to call on all Department of the Interior agencies to use their existing mitigation authorities within the many efforts currently underway to ensure robust mitigation outcomes that will conserve critical public resources.In short, increasing and improving the use of mitigation is not a boring detail, but rather an important step recognizing that it is possible to accommodate needed investment in energy, transportation and water management while at the same time protecting the nation's most critical natural resources that our economy and the quality of our lives depend upon.In other important news, the secretary reiterated her support for full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which supports national parks, wildlife refuges, forests, rivers and lakes, community parks, trails and more in all 50 states.We've long viewed LWCF as a common-sense and critical conservation program. It balances the use of one natural resource -- oil and gas -- with the conservation of another by using a portion of drilling fees to protect important land and water resources. But despite an increase in energy production, funding for land and water protection has been low and unpredictable. Full funding for LWCF would go a long way in addressing that imbalance.Finally, Jewell also announced an initiative \"to inspire millions of young people to play, learn, serve and work outdoors.\"I couldn't agree more with her focus on educating and involving America's young people in conservation, and I'm proud of our own efforts at The Nature Conservancy to engage younger generations.Getting it right on things like mitigation and strong funding for LWCF -- efforts that balance human needs with the need to conserve nature -- is a great way to start ensuring these younger Americans can be inspired by nature, and realize its very practical value to their lives."}, {"title": "2 Polar Bears Shot And Killed After Attack In Northern Canada", "text": "Two polar bears were shot and killed on Friday after a bear attacked two people in a northern Canadian town, authorities said.Around 5 a.m. on the morning after Halloween, a 30-year-old woman was attacked by a polar bear in Churchill, Manitoba, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post.Churchill resident Bill Ayotte, 69, exited his house when he heard the unidentified woman being attacked, the RCMP said.

When it is at risk, we are at risk. There is a precarious balance between humankind and nature - a reality we must never forget.If we are going to change the world to save ourselves, we have to save the ocean; and if we are going to save the ocean we have to start by saving the cetaceans. We have to protect their habitat and ensure that all marine life can thrive, so that we can too.Last year, at the first World Whale Conference, delegates agreed that a new coalition should be formed to effectively protect the world's cetaceans from the many and varied threats that they face.On November 6-7, the 2013 World Whale Conference will be held in Cruiseport, Gloucester, Massachusetts, USA.With the conference as its backdrop, the inaugural meeting of the World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) is guaranteed to make a splash on the international stage; bearing a new banner carried by its first Honorary President, Jean-Michel Cousteau:\"Without collaboration we will achieve nothing more than a drop in the ocean. The World Cetacean Alliance is a unique opportunity to combine our collective energy, knowledge, and expertise in order to protect whales, dolphins, and their habitats.\"Introducing the WCA\u00a9 WCA, used with permission, all rights reservedDylan Walker, Secretariat of the WCA, emphasizes that the World Cetacean Alliance represents a new and powerful global community that is willing to work together to protect cetaceans and their habitats. Walker says the WCA will actively seek recognition and influence as the largest international network of experts and advocates for whales and dolphins.\"We currently have a reach of 850,000 people through the WCA partners and hope to crack a million by the end of the conference. That's funding, marketing, and campaigning power we intend to use to help cetaceans, including captive orca which is at the top of our list.\"Hotspots - Putting Cetaceans on the MapPart of the first year challenge for the WCA has been identifying \"Hotspots\" around the world where cetaceans are at risk. To do this, the WCA has created a survey using a mapping tool called \"sea sketch\" and invited the public to participate by identifying locations on the map which deserve attention. The information is being entered into a database and used to identify issues and bring pressure for change. You can take the survey here.The top three issues for the WCA are:\u2022 Releasing the wild orca called Morgan from captivity in Loro Parque; \u2022 Saving the critically endangered Maui's dolphin in New Zealand; and \u2022 Protecting the Southern Ocean / Ross Sea from whaling and other destructive practices.Cousteau Has a DreamIt is only fitting that Jean-Michel Cousteau would be the first Honorary President of the WCA. He is a tireless and impassioned advocate for cetaceans, with a special place in his heart for orca.When I first met Jean-Michel, he held up his iPhone and displayed a picture of a trainer standing on the nose of an orca and said - in a tone which I will never forget: \"This has to stop, this is anti-educational, don't tell me that kids learn anything when we are doing these circus acts.\" (Photo \u00a9 Carrie Vonderhaar, Ocean Futures Society)In a recent article, Call to Freedom, Jean-Michel talks about his personal experience with Keiko, the male orca made famous in the film, Free Willy. He talks about the plight of Tilikum, and speaks of hope for other captive orca including Corky, Lolita, and of course Morgan, the young wild born female captured in the Netherlands, illicitly sold to SeaWorld, and the subject of an ongoing international custody battle. Cousteau writes:\"My dream would be that it be illegal to capture any orca anywhere for any reason. The orcas now in captivity could be prevented from reproducing and would live their lives in retirement under the best conditions we could provide. There would be no \"shows,\" no entertainment, only activities to keep the orcas active. They would die of premature death like all captive orcas. A sad chapter in the history of our treatment of sentient, intelligent, complex animals like orcas would finally close, with the recognition that captivity of these animals has moved and changed us as well.2013 World Whale ConferenceThe lineup for the conference is an impressive who's who list of cetacean experts and advocates: Dylan Walker (WCA Secretariat); Bill Rossiter (Cetacean Society International); Keith Takaoka (BiLLe Fund Ltd); Thorsten Lisker (WCA Individual Partner); Ian Rowlands (WhaleFest co-founder); John Fanshawe (BirdLife International); Patricia Sullivan (Cetacean Society International); Michael Fishbach (The Great Whale Conservancy); Sami Mhenni (Houtiyat); Floppy \"Jo\" Halliday (Whale Rescue); Barbara Maas (Nabu International); Dr. Naomi Rose (Animal Welfare Institute); and Dr. Ingrid Visser (Orca Research Trust).The full conference agenda and speaker's schedule can be found here.David Kirby, author of Death at SeaWorld, will be giving the keynote address, and it should come as no surprise that the conference will also feature a special screening of Gabriela Cowperthwaite's powerful documentary Blackfish; the hard hitting expose that challenges society to examine the harm to cetaceans, and consider the ethical cost to humanity, posed by SeaWorld's captive orca shows.Following the screening of Blackfish there will be a special panel discussion led by two of the world's most knowledgeable orca experts - Dr. Ingrid Visser and Dr. Naomi Rose. Dr. Visser will give an update on the efforts to Free Morgan and Dr. Rose is sure to share her thoughts about keeping orca and dolphins in captivity, and alternatives to the concrete tanks found in places like SeaWorld - a topic which she recently wrote about in this article.Information about tickets to the conference can be found here and at the WCA website: www.worldcetaceanalliance.orgFor those who can't physically attend the conference, the WCA will be live streaming the event here and everyone is encouraged to join in beginning at 9:30 a.m. (ET) on November 6th and 7th."}, {"title": "Environment", "text": ""}, {"title": "Digging and Drilling in Fracktown, USA", "text": "A dozen toy shovels dangle from the ceiling of Mr. Kovach's English classroom at Northeastern Ohio's Howland High School, urging students to dig deeply into classic texts such as To Kill a Mockingbird and Beowulf. On a recent Friday morning, one college prep class delves into a scene in which Beowulf sacrifices one of his warriors while he contemplates a battle strategy.These students, and a group of honors students I spoke with over lunch, are strategizing, too. They view this metaphoric digging as a tool to position themselves for seats at respectable universities around the country. With one exception, they plan to earn degrees in such fields as engineering, medicine, law, and pastry arts and then to settle somewhere else. They see little chance of professional success in their home town.I ask them about the lucrative oil and gas extraction going on around them, and they admit they know very little about it. One student mentions there may be some environmental concerns and says the topic arose briefly in a social studies class. They know about the hotel going up behind the mall in nearby Niles \"for all the Texas oilmen who will be coming.\" About the issue in general, another adds, \"They don't tell us too much.\"For that kind of education, they would have to leave their suburban comfort and head to the edge of Lordstown, where a more literal digging is underway. The residents of a nicely groomed manufactured home park are watching -- and smelling and hearing -- a rig as it drills the first of eight approved extraction wells about 800 feet from their property line. Pat, the resident closest to the site, says the noise and light have been intrusive for the past few months. At one stage lasting several weeks, her home was bathed in virtual daylight 24 hours a day. The noise continues and keeps her up at night. She is not looking forward to the arrival of seven additional wells.On the day of my visit, Pat and her neighbor Colleen have summoned John, a Global Community Monitoring volunteer, to bring out his equipment. They have smelled some strong odors throughout the day and want him to run a test. We sniff around the property and stand inside Pat's kitchen for a while. They call Colleen their canary; she describes the random smells she has detected since the drilling began. Ultimately, they decide not to use one of two plastic bags John has to capture samples in his monitoring device. They will save these pricey items for a day with less wind and more certain olfactory evidence.We drive away, and I see signs of these people's commitment to their homes and neighborhood. Gardens and crisp green lawns have been carefully tended over the years; sunrooms, decks and carports speak of financial ease and comfort to scale. Unlike the high school students, these retirees and their mobile homes seem firmly planted. And so their uncertainty -- about the conditions imposed on them and the long-term effects of the drilling -- has turned them back into learners and, to their own surprise, activists.John, a diesel mechanic in his mid-50s, is quite willing to do the teaching. A lecture by Youngstown State University scientists ignited his interest in the extraction industry, and now he can quickly overwhelm a listener with information. About those anticipated Texas oilmen, he says \"They're already here.\" Some of them converged on members of the Niles City Council after that body passed a resolution banning extraction there, and within a matter of weeks the decision was reversed. (John and fellow citizens plan to put the issue on an upcoming ballot, aiming for a more decisive and irreversible result.)Then there is the matter of the eleven earthquakes that shook the area shortly after injection wells started pouring contaminated water from the fracking sites into the ground. Alarmed at Ohio DNR's (Department of Natural Resources) insistence on short-term monitoring and self-regulation, John bought a seismograph on the Internet and convinced a science teacher to install it in a vulnerable sandstone school building close to a soon-to-open injection site. In a few weeks, the children will be monitoring the ground below them. They hope for the best, but as John remarks, \"We have only one aquifer, and what will happen if it is compromised?\"Yet John also tells about a friend who has leased twenty acres for a $64,000 signing fee and expects to earn $50,000 annually for 30 years. My sense is that people who do this are not necessarily greedy; some are hungry and others have had their careers cut short by economic shifts. In Howland the school system reports an increase in the child poverty rate from four percent in 2000 to over 16 percent in 2011. Spikes in this rate align with the closing of established factories, notably Delphi and Packard Electric, both of which supplied the auto industry for half a century and employed generations of skilled workers. Even the high school students observe that some of their fellow students \"hide their poverty\" behind new clothes and other material things. And infrequent visitors like me commiserate with them over the loss of signature flavors of the local Italian restaurants we thought would always be there for us. In terms of economic well-being, we have far surpassed Beowulf's sacrifice of a single compatriot.   In many ways, the conditions, the opportunities, and the risks of extraction present this lovely place with the perfect storm. When I complimented Mr. Kovach on his metaphoric shovels, he smiled and pointed to a set of bright red children's snow shovels in the back room, sitting ready for an even deeper plunge into literary texts and the larger social questions these readings evoke. I hope he deploys them well and that all of his neighbors are similarly equipped in the days and years to come."}, {"title": "As Experts Recognize New Form Of Black Lung, Coal Industry Follows Familiar Pattern Of Denial", "text": "Ted Latusek has black lung disease.

Business and political leaders know this yet they do nothing. Instead they continue to bet on our future and deepen our addiction to fossil fuels. They abdicate responsibility and allow the deadly fossil fuel giants of the last two centuries to continue to stoke the boilers of global warming.Now more than ever people need to demand that all financial institutions that we have entrusted with our money and welfare remove their money -- our money -- from investments in the fossil fuel industry.Make no mistake we are in a battle for the future with the past. The centuries-old fossil fuel industries have roots deep within our governments and other institutions. They know their days are numbered, they know their power is waning, but they will not go silently into the night. they will not give up their power without a fight.If governments will not bite the hand that feeds, if they will not free themselves from corporate sponsorship then we, the citizens, the concerned and morally driven individuals will have to take a stand. We will have to make sacrifices to challenge the deadly status quo. This is what history teaches us.There are new ways to meet our needs, to lift people out of poverty and limit climate change, but the path to a brighter future is being blocked by the past, by the vested and invested coal and oil barons.We know they want to continue to burn more and more carbon, which will lead to irreparable damage to our health, our lives and our environment. If we want to prevent runaway climate change from getting worse we need to leave the carbon reserves we know about -- and the ones we do not yet know about -- in the ground.So how can we stop the fossil fuel industry destroy our future on this planet?The divestment movement is part of the answer. Modeled on the successful campaign in the 1980s to divest from apartheid South Africa, this new fossil fuel divestment campaign revolves around one central moral reasoning: if it's wrong to wreck the planet, then it's wrong to profit from that wreckage.A simple numerical understanding further confirms the urgency behind this moral standing.As it stands, we can emit roughly 500 more gigatons of carbon dioxide and still stay below 2 degrees Celsius of global warming as highlighted in the UN IPCC's latest report -- anything more than that adds up to catastrophe for all life on earth. Burning the fossil fuel that corporations now have in their reserves would result in emitting 2,795 gigatons of carbon dioxide -- five times the so-called safe amount. But the fossil fuel companies are planning to burn it all and our governments are going to let them -- they are even going to help them -- that is, unless we rise up to stop them.The world is quickly reaching a \"Point of No Return\" for preventing the worst impacts of climate change. With total disregard for this unfolding global disaster, the global fossil fuel industry is planning 14 massive coal, oil and gas projects that would produce as much new carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2020 as the entire U.S., and delay in taking action on climate change of at least a decade. One of these 14 projects is in the Arctic.While the Arctic is melting, courageous people are putting their liberty on the line to confront the fossil fuel companies leading the charge -- as in the case of the Arctic 30. Thirty people are still behind bars in Russia following a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic in September. They took action because they know it is wrong to exploit melting ice to drill for more of the oil that is warming our world. They were first charged with piracy, an absurd accusation. Now the Russian authorities say that accusation is being replaced with a charge of hooliganism -- a charge that is just as absurd and carries up to 7 years in jail.Some are taking direct action, while others are forming massive movements telling Big Oil that enough is enough. We want people everywhere to help undermine the credibility and influence of those companies where it hurts the most for them -- their reputational and financial capital.The fossil fuel divestment movement is growing fast. Since its launch in the U.S., 100 cities, states, religious institutions and universities, have made a commitment to divest. Now it's Europe's turn.Earlier this month, the University of Oxford released a study concluding that the current effort is the fastest growing divestment campaign in history and poses a far-reaching and serious threat to the fossil fuel industry's bottom line. While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are calling for an end to fossil fuel subsidies, PricewaterhouseCoopers warns of stranded investments should we not limit climate change. The movement needs to reach climax soon.We'll be looking to grow the campaign further this month with the Fossil Free Europe tour, a divestment road show with stops in Berlin, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Birmingham, culminating in London on November 1st.We aim to inspire even more activism across the continent, as well as connect European efforts with the movement in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The fossil fuel industry is one of the most powerful industries on the planet. Now, a global movement is rising up to confront it.

John Hickenlooper's (D) office with Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, which they've renamed \"gas patch kids\" to represent real children living in areas impacted by the surge of oil and gas drilling in the state.The Colorado Moms Know Best group showed up with a petition signed by over 8,000 Colorado moms. It called for Hickenloooper to implement \"common sense yet innovative standards to control oil and gas emissions, which can harm kids\u2019 health,\" according to a statement from the group.\u201cWe were shocked and angry when learned that after almost a year of meetings, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is recommending air pollution rules that are weaker instead of stronger,\u201d Jaime Travis of Colorado Moms Know Best said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that moms are counting on Gov. Hickenlooper to protect the health of our kids.\"The group tweeted this photo of themselves at the capitol Wednesday:According to a recent \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association, four counties in Colorado -- Arapahoe, Douglas, Jefferson and Larimer -- all received \"F\" grades. An \"F\" is given to a region when it spends nine days or more over the air quality standard and includes at least one or more day with unhealthy, very unhealthy or hazardous air. Boulder, La Plata and Weld counties all received \"D\" grades, which means seven to nine days were spent over the standard in a region.All of those counties are counted among some of the most densely drilled areas in the state.Smog and ozone levels have been rising in Colorado since 2010, the Denver Post recently reported, with several areas in the state exceeding the federal ozone limit of 75 parts per billion.And although many Coloradans voiced disappointment over Hickenlooper's draft air quality regulations, the governor's communications director Eric Brown tried to offer reassurance that more work will be done on the rules. \u201cThese rules are still pending,\u201d he told the Colorado Independent. \u201cThe Governor has encouraged a robust stakeholder outreach process and a strong science-based approach in developing new rules. \u2026 The administration\u2019s goal is for Colorado to have regulations that are a national model in protecting public health and the environment.\u201dThere are more than 51,000 drill sites operating in Colorado and in the last four years the state has failed to meet federal ozone standards.The Colorado moms who staged the \"gas patch kids\" protest are calling for state air quality standards that require the oil and gas industry to stop natural gas venting (including methane), use capture technologies on storage tanks, disclose chemical emissions and use high-tech infrared cameras to detect drilling leaks and repair them quickly.\u201cIt is 100 percent unacceptable to allow companies to spew even more pollutants into the air my kids breathe every time they play outside, right next to our backyard,\u201d said Andrea Roy, Erie mom and supporter of the Colorado Moms Know Best network in a press statement. \u201cWhile I am furious that the rules seem to be getting weaker rather than stronger, I have hope that Gov.

These critical services include food, water, shelter, heating and cooling, medical and emergency services, communications, and fueling. Facilities that can provide these services include community buildings, schools, supermarkets, gas stations, cell towers, and hospitals, among others.There are many technologies, and combinations of technologies, that can be used to provide resilient power to critical facilities. One method is to add solar PV to the facility, with a battery storage backup system. Because there is a lot of interest in solar and energy storage systems, and questions about how they operate and interact with the grid, we decided to provide the following primer. We also describe new business models and companies that are beginning to move into this solar storage space, taking advantage of new revenue streams that could change the game for how energy storage is financed.Solar/Storage 101Let's say you have a large facility or campus with a sizeable PV system on site (local generation). The PV system generates electricity when the sun shines, which is mostly at midday and early afternoon, supplying the facility with electricity. During those times, if the PV system's electricity generation exceeds local demand, the excess generation is sold onto the grid under a net metering contract. When local generation does not meet the facility's demand, for example in the evening, the grid provides electricity to bridge the gap. This works well for the local facility; all of its power needs are met. However, for the electric grid operator, who must make electricity supply meet demand from moment to moment, the PV system's electricity feeding into the grid can cause problems, because PV output is very variable over very short time periods. The grid operator cannot predict how much electricity is going to be coming from that PV system at any given moment. If a cloud happens to come between the sun and the PV modules, electricity generated from the PV system will fall quickly, and the grid operator must have spinning reserves ready to step in at any time to make up for the sudden loss of generation. If this were not the case, the local facility, and others on the grid, would experience constant fluctuations in power.If this PV system were a grid-scale system, selling power to the grid under a power purchase agreement, the same variability problem would exist, but at a greater scale. At higher levels of penetration of wind and solar on the grid, this variable generation can cause significant problems on the grid.Going back to the local facility with its PV system, one way we can mitigate problems caused by variable PV generation is to add battery storage to the system. Now, when local generation exceeds local demand, the excess electricity is first used to charge the battery. When the battery is fully charged, excess power is exported to the grid. If a momentary cloud comes overhead, the PV/battery storage system continues to export electricity at a steady state, because the system can pull power back out of the battery to compensate for the momentary drop in solar generation. This is a much more stable system from the grid operator's perspective. Output from the solar/storage system now looks much more like output from a dispatchable gas, coal, nuclear or hydro plant, and the PV/storage system owner may now be able to sell power into markets that were not previously open to him because of the addition of the battery.Resilient Power 101In order to provide a resilient power benefit to our local facility, we add special switches that can isolate (or 'island') the PV/storage system in case of a grid failure. When the larger grid goes down due to a natural disaster, a switch is thrown that decouples the local circuit and allows it to continue to function as an isolated unit. In this scenario, the local facility would need to drop non-essential load, keeping only its critical loads powered, in order to extend the life of the battery. For example, in the example of a university, critical loads might include lighting and HVAC equipment in buildings designated as community emergency shelters. Other loads, such as non-critical buildings (libraries, computer labs, theaters, etc.) would not be powered. The PV system would continue to charge the battery and power critical loads when the sun was shining, and the battery would power critical loads when there was not enough solar power. In order for this system to work, the PV would need to be sized sufficiently both to power critical loads and charge the battery fully during the daily period of peak insolation; and the battery would need to be of sufficient size to carry critical loads overnight and into the next afternoon.In order to make this system even more resilient, we could add a supplemental generator, such as a gas- or biomass-powered microturbine or engine running in CHP mode (where waste heat is captured and used for space heating). In effect, we now have a microgrid.This simple system becomes more complicated, but also more cost-effective, when additional revenue streams from grid services are factored in. If the PV/storage system were located in an area that is compliant with FERC orders requiring fair compensation for grid services, the battery storage could earn significant revenue by selling ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation services. In some areas, it could also engage in electricity arbitrage, buying cheap power at off-peak times and discharging it during peak demand times, when it is most valuable. Since grid-damaging natural disasters occur only infrequently, the battery would be able to generate these revenue streams during the vast majority of its lifespan. This greatly improves the cost/benefit calculation for the PV/storage system. Decisions about whether to provide services to the grid or the local facility would be made on an economic basis, depending on whether more money could be made by providing grid services, or saved by providing power to the host facility. If the grid were to go down, the PV/storage system would island just as before, providing valuable critical services to the community at large.With more grid operators coming into compliance with the FERC orders mentioned above, new third-party battery companies are beginning to take advantage of the revenue streams made possible by these regulatory changes. Two companies operating in this space are Solar Grid Storage and Energy Surety Partners. These companies provide the battery and inverter free of charge, collocated with a PV or wind generator. Their business models are based on the provision of grid services, services that energy storage systems like batteries can provide very quickly and accurately. They also engage in electricity arbitrage. The renewable generator benefits because the presence of energy storage smooths the combined system output and makes it more dispatchable; in a microgrid situation, the battery helps to integrate and balance local renewable generation with other generators and with loads. An example of this model in action is the new Konterra solar microgrid in Maryland.Such new business models could make it much easier for customers to add storage to existing solar systems, or to build storage into new systems, through what are essentially leasing arrangements similar to the third-party models that have made PV broadly accessible and wildly popular. As more areas of the country come into compliance with the new FERC orders, the cost/benefit calculation for energy storage will continue to improve, and up-front costs will continue to decline, removing a major financing barrier to purchasing expensive equipment. This is how the solar industry has exploded in size; solar storage could well be the next technology to take off through creative technical and financial engineering.In the very near future, Clean Energy Group will feature Energy Surety Partners and Solar Grid Storage in a webinar on solar/storage solutions.

With more than 4 billion screw-based light bulb sockets in the United States, getting an efficient bulb into each one of them is really important because the potential energy savings are massive:NRDC Lighting Buying GuideU.S. lighting options have significantly improved in the past few years, thanks to the phase-out of old, inefficient incandescent bulbs and the introduction of lots of new energy-saving, innovative products. Here are some tips on how to take advantage of these improved options:LEDs are really coming on fastWhile CFLs continue to have the lowest purchase cost of the energy efficient light bulb options, they have a few remaining challenges that LED bulbs have overcome. Most notably, LED bulbs do not have the 1- to 3-minute run-up time to meet full brightness and many of the models are dimmable. LEDs come in all shapes and flavors. Also a 60W replacement LED bulb now costs around $10 today compared to $25 to $40 just a couple of years ago. To ensure you have a good experience, we recommend:a) Only buy LED bulbs with the ENERGY STAR\u00ae label -- These bulbs will meet the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s requirements for lifetime, efficiency, and other key performance criteria.b) Buy the light color you prefer -- If you want a bulb to have the same yellowish white color as your old incandescent, buy a bulb marketed as \u201cwarm white.\u201d The Lighting Facts box on the back of the bulb packaging will list a color temperature of 2700K. If you prefer \u201ccooler,\u201d more bluish white-looking light, purchase a bulb marketed as \u201cDaylight\u201d with a higher color temperature of 4000K or even 5600K. Hint: Because this is a personal preference, consider trying one of each before switching out all your bulbs.c) Put the right bulb in the right socket --Most new LED bulbs now look more like the old incandescent versions and can distribute light in all directions. But some designs, like the ones with a half dome on top that resemble a sno-cone, may not deliver enough light in the downward direction and would not be suitable in reading lamps. But you should choose a LED reflector bulb for recessed can or down lighting because it\u2019s designed to produce a beam of downward light where you need it.Want to learn more?EPA has released a highly informative two-part podcast about lighting that includes the lighting buyer from Home Depot, a lighting designer, an expert from EPA, and me. In it, Mark from Home Depot provides perhaps the most practical advice of all:Bring your old burnt-out bulb to the store so the clerk can help you find the new replacement bulb that will deliver the same amount and type of light -- and is roughly the same size to fit your existing fixture.So as you\u2019re preparing to move the clock hands back an hour, consider that the end of \u201cdaylight savings time\u201d doesn\u2019t mean your savings have to end: today\u2019s lighting options offer numerous ways to save energy and money, too."}, {"title": "The Real Stuff of Farming as a Way of Life", "text": "I have gone to several conferences on farming and the environment.

Eloquent speakers denounce injustice and paint a picture of what we had and what we still can have.At first I thought it strange there was so much emphasis on practical matters, especially when the conference focused on farming.

They know the country needs them.\"I want you to farm. I want you to take care of the land, the animals, the wildlife, the people while making a fair living for all of your efforts,\" wrote Rebecca Thistlethwaite, author of Farms with a Future (Chelsea Green, 2012). Thistlethwaite addressed her appeal to the emerging small family farmers.\"I want you to last -- physically, mentally, and financially,\" she said to them.Thistlethwaite speaks from experience. She has been farming for years. She learned valuable lessons in her \"bumpy\" road to farming. She did some things well and she prospered. But she also overextended her business by 430 percent in six years -- and failed.Failure led her to the classroom of other farmers. She traveled all over the country and interviewed several beginning and successful farmers (in California, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, Minnesota and Virginia) in order to discover the magic of what makes farms have a future.The right stuff of farming includes more than hard work. According to Thistlethwaitte: \"The farmers and ranchers who are working to balance their own economic viability while providing good jobs, benefits to their communities, and reducing their environmental footprint, all while nourishing people with tasty, clean food -- these are the farms with a future.\"Thistlethwaitte is an exemplary citizen. She is also a farmer who wants to spread her good message widely. She knows the perils of agribusiness. But she knows even more the blessings of working the land with respect and knowledge. \"Organic, ecologically based farming is the future of agriculture,\" she wrote.Farms with a Future is primarily a how-to book for beginner farmers. It introduces the reader to many of the economic, agronomic, social and political opportunities and difficulties the farmer is likely to encounter in raising crops, fruits and vegetables.Farms with a Future is also a well-written passionate and beautiful book about farming as an uplifting, reforming, and vital responsibility of a democratic society.We need to buy our food from those beginning farmers who put all they have to give us healthy food -- and maintain farming as a way of life.I recommend Thistlethwaitte's book very highly."}, {"title": "Climate Change: Should What Happened to the Woolly Mammoth Be a Warning to Us?", "text": "Glen M. MacDonald is director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA, and a professor of geography and of ecology and evolutionary biology. Jon Christensen, a journalist-in-residence at the Institute, talked with Dr. MacDonald about his research on climate change, its causes and its impact on the environment and society, what climate change holds in store for California, and what the demise of the woolly mammoth could mean for us.Jon Christensen: What are the biggest concerns that we should have about climate change in California?Glen MacDonald: Fire and water! I work on both issues and it is not a pretty picture. I also worry about the impact of increasing temperatures on public health through heat stroke and diseases such as dengue fever. Nasty stuff. Heat stroke will likely have its greatest impact on those who cannot afford a lot of air-conditioning. Something like dengue, however, is more an equal opportunity pestilence. In fact, I did some work in Malaysia and saw that it was the more affluent areas with watered gardens and lots of houseplants that had the most trouble. All those irrigated microhabitats provided breeding places for the mosquitos.Jon Christensen: How will climate change affect water in California?Glen MacDonald: With increased temperatures and rates of evaporation and decreased precipitation in parts of the state and in the Colorado Basin we will face even more of a scramble to maintain a secure and steady supply for agriculture and our cities. The fact that the snowpack will be smaller and spring run-off more flashy means water managers really have their work cut out to capture the water that is available and have it ready for the long hot summers to come. This challenge may be compounded by the fact that when it does rain the storms will be more intense and hard to manage.At the same time, we will also have too much water along the coast. As sea level rises coastal communities will face having too much of the salty kind flowing over them. The IPCC's sea-level projections have been pretty much bang on to what we have observed. Having a place on the current beachfront in the Colony at Malibu is not likely to be that attractive. Broad Beach is already facing serious issues. Challenging times ahead for some of the most expensive real estate in the world.Jon Christensen:What about fires?Glen MacDonald: The hot and dry conditions of the 21st century will produce greater fire hazard for the state no doubt. We are already seeing a series of record fires this past decade. Things like the Rim Fire are what it is going to be like in general. Fire suppression over the 20th century built up the fuel load in our forests and climate change provides just the right conditions to really stoke the flames. Watch out for your cabin in the woods at Mammoth or Lake Arrowhead. They could be in the thick of it!Jon Christensen: You have studied what happened to the woolly mammoth, a once plentiful species that went extinct long ago during a period of changing climate. Should the fate of the woolly mammoth be a warning to us?Glen MacDonald: Now, I actually am one of those people who do believe that there are important episodes of natural climate change in addition to the human induced kind. In fact, much of my own research is on natural climate change and its impacts, Some people have a thing for dinosaurs, but I have a real affection for the woolly mammoth, These things survived in absolutely brutal climates and environments. Millions of them live in northern Europe, across Asia, and into North America. Yet by about 10,000 years ago they had all but vanished from the continents and the last few died out on Wrangle Island off the coast of Siberia about 4,000 years ago. Our studies of their extinction have gathered thousands of pieces of evidence from things like radiocarbon dated tusks to the latest analysis of DNA preserved in frozen remains of these beasts. From that we can see that despite their toughness, wide geographic distribution, and relatively large numbers, climate change, along with habitat alteration, and a push from human hunters here and there was all it took to wipe them out. I take a look at climate change and the altered and disrupted habitat of the planet today and wonder how many species will make it through the 21st century and how many will join the mammoths."}, {"title": "Kauai GMO Bill Vetoed By Mayor", "text": "Kauai Mayor Bernard P.

The bill passed on October 16 after a nineteen-hour marathon hearing that lasted until 3:30 in the morning, not to mention months of protests and debates running up to the hearing.But Mayor Carvahlo said in a press release that he felt he had no choice but to veto the bill on legal grounds. \u201cI have always said I agree with the intent of this bill to provide for pesticide use disclosure, create meaningful buffer zones and conduct a study on the health and environmental issues relating to pesticide use on Kauai,\u201d the mayor stated. \u201cHowever, I believe strongly that this bill is legally flawed. That being the case, I had no choice but to veto.\u201dPrior to the county council vote that passed Bill 2491, nine Hawaii attorneys released a joint statement asserting that the bill was in fact legally sound: \u201cWe believe that Bill 2491 is sound, and the mere threat of a lawsuit by industry interests should not prevent the Council from taking action they believe is important to their community...We feel it would be unfortunate if the Council were to allow any well-financed opponent to determine public policy merely by threatening to sue.\u201dThe well-financed opponents to which the attorneys referred include biotech giants like Syngenta, DuPont-Pioneer, Dow and BASF. Bill 2491 would force agricultural companies to disclose when and where they spray pesticides, restrict spraying to a certain distance away from public areas, and disclose what genetically engineered crops they grow on Kauai.During the hearing that preceded the county council vote, Mayor Carvahlo\u2019s concerns had focused on the financial burden the bill would put on Kauai, estimating that $1.3 million would need to be appropriated by next year to implement different aspects of the bill. Attorneys for the biotech companies had said the bill unfairly targeted big agriculture and allowed for \u201cillegal taking\u201d of company property.The veto can be overridden by the Kauai County Council with a minimum of five votes."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - October 31, 2013", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport FACEBOOK: Green News Report The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Students disrupt Obama's healthcare rally to protest Keystone XL pipeline; Koch Brothers' pipeline spills in Texas; BP's toxic oil spill still hurting Gulf fishermen; Spain's remarkable solar record; PLUS: Stanford University confirms: Renewable energy can provide 100% of the world's energy needs ...

But he skipped bail on July 22, 2012 and fled Germany.The following month, France-based Interpol issued an international request for his arrest.The organisation does not have the power to issue international arrest warrants but can ask member countries make arrests based on foreign warrants through a \"Red Notice\".Watson, known to his supporters as \"The Captain\", had been on the run at sea since then, and even participated in a new campaign against Japanese whalers in Antarctica last winter.But he said on Twitter Thursday that he was no longer the subject of Interpol's \"Red Notice\".And when an anti-whaling fleet he had been on docked in Australia in March, he made no appearance on the ground but the country's attorney-general had hinted he would not be detained if he came to shore.Japanese authorities describe methods used by Sea Shepherd against whaling ships -- for example blocking the boats' propellers -- as \"terrorist\".Copyright (2013) AFP.

I just experienced such a moment.I was a participant at a gathering in San Francisco where the Governors of California, Oregon, Washington and the Premier of British Columbia made a commitment to work as a region to combat global climate change. With passion and courage these four leaders boldly went where very few politicians have been willing to go.By signing the Pacific Coast Action Plan On Climate and Energy, the four jurisdictions agreed to an ambitious agenda including putting a price on carbon in Washington and Oregon that will complement B.C.'s carbon tax and California's cap and trade programs. In effect this would establish a carbon market in the world's fifth largest economy.The standing room only crowd consisted largely of business representatives. B.C. Minister of the Environment Mary Polak, said, \"Leadership in climate action is good for your economy.\" She noted that due to the B.C. carbon tax the province's economy and population has grown while their fossil fuel consumption has dropped. Steve Clem, of Skansa, one of the world's largest construction companies, said they were in support of this action plan on climate and energy because it was good for their business, \"We are growing as a company because of sustainable building practices not despite it.\"Another unprecedented occurrence on a day filled with them was the participation by representatives of the West Coast's multi-million dollar shellfish industry. Their livelihoods are in grave danger as a result of carbon emissions. Oceans act like a massive sponge absorbing airborne carbon. This is changing the chemistry of the oceans, causing them to become more acidic. In fact ocean acidity has risen 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution. Due to its unique system of currents and upwelling events the Pacific Northwest is being impacted harder and sooner than any other place on the globe. Acidity levels in some places are already so high that oyster larvae cannot survive. Some shellfish growers have left the region; others have installed expensive monitoring equipment and shut down operations when ocean acidity is dangerously high.Coupled with discussion of the compelling economic opportunities was a strong sense of urgency and moral imperative. Washington Governor Jay Inslee said, \"We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and the last to be able to do anything about it.\" Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber stated that climate change was the greatest challenge we will face in the decades to come.The West Coast region is not waiting for the federal government to take action. As Congress remains gridlocked and climate deniers wield bizarre, scientifically-baseless power in DC, West Coast leadership is stepping up to the most pressing global issue facing humanity.As we headed back to Oregon our plane passed snow-covered Mt. Shasta glistening in the sun. I realized this was what was at stake, at the heart of the remarkable step the governors and premier had just taken. If we want our children's children to be able to experience awe at the beauty of a magnificent snow-covered mountain we must act.It reminded me of the Wallace Stegner quote Governor Kitzhaber had used to close his speech:\"One cannot be pessimistic about the West. This is the native home of hope. When it fully learns that cooperation, not rugged individualism, is the quality that most characterizes and preserves it, then it will have achieved itself and outlived its origins. Then it has a chance to create a society to match its scenery.\"I am a bit more hopeful today that might actually create such a society."}, {"title": "GMO Labeling Lifeline by the Numbers & Brands", "text": "We have reported (here and here) on the mounting opposition by big Food and Ag to I-522, the Washington state ballot initiative to label genetically modified food.

John Thune (R-SD) -- to block U.S. airlines from abiding by the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) -- a law aimed at reducing harmful aviation pollution.At the heart of Thune's battle cry was the claim that the EU ETS infringed on US sovereignty because it required emissions reductions on all flights to and from Europe, including the pollution emitted over US and international airspace.   This prompted Thune and his colleagues to pass legislation giving the Secretary of Transportation authority to prohibit US airlines from obeying the EU law. Sen. Thune went on the speaking circuit decrying the EU ETS as a \"threat to American sovereignty\" while affirming on FoxNews that Article I of the 1944 Chicago Convention [PDF] allows the EU to control its own airspace.  Adamantly opposed to the idea of infringing on the airspace of another sovereign land, Sen. Thune restated this position during multiple Congressional hearings here and here by articulating, \"let me be clear, no one in Congress is against the EU implementing ETS within their own boundaries.\"  Leading up to the 38th Assembly of International Civil Aviation Organization -- the UN body charged with developing a global plan to reduce aviation emissions -- in Montreal, Sen. Thune crafted a letter to U.S. negotiators reminding them not to allow the EU to tread on this sovereign land.As anticipated, ICAO agreed to a global solution by 2016 that would come into effect in 2020, and they effectively gutted the EU ETS by calling on Europe to reduce the scope of the law to flights within its own airspace. Following ICAO, the European Commission took the directive and has proposed amending the EU ETS to just covering the portion of flights in its own airspace as a global agreement hobbles along.Based on Sen. Thune's own rationale, these developments should be heralded as a major victory by every member of Congress and defender of national sovereignty. Now that the EU has been beaten back into it's own airspace and a threat to U.S. sovereignty averted, one would think Sen. Thune's legislative accomplishment is no longer applicable to the issue.  For this reason, those following the issue closely were perplexed by news reports that Sen. Thune intends to contact Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx about invoking the Thune law's prohibition on U.S. airline compliance with the ETS. While the request raises questions about Sen. Thune's ability to recognize a win, it also brings into light the reassessment language in the bill that directs the Secretary to reassess a prohibition in the event that:  1. The European Union amends its own Directive (which the European Commission is in the process of doing)  2. An international agreement on aircraft emissions is adopted (ICAO agreed to agree on a global solution in 2016) or  3. The U.S. enacts a public law or issues regulations addressing aircraft emissions (The Clean Air Act of 1970 Tittle II, Part B sections 231-234 grants the EPA authority to regulate aviation emissions.)If anyone is now threatening American sovereignty, it's Senator Thune himself, because if we tell Europe they can't regulate pollution in Europe, just imagine how many foreign companies operating in the U.S. would chomp at the bit to use this as a precedent to violate a whole host of health, safety, national security and environmental laws within American boundaries."}, {"title": "Austin Firefighters Save Dog From Floodwaters Because They 'Don't Just Rescue Two-Legged Victims'", "text": "The Austin Fire Department has been battling widespread flooding after a fall storm dumped up to 15 inches of rain over parts of central Texas.

Heat continues to build in the oceans. But the last decade has been quite a surprise when it comes to atmospheric temperatures. For all intents and purposes we have seen a \"hiatus\" in the warming trend in the atmosphere. This is not to say that temperatures are not elevated -- they are; the average temperature over the past decade is higher than any other 10-year average on record.It's also relevant to note that the rise in global temperatures has never been smooth and steady. Nor would we expect it to be. Myriad factors in addition to greenhouse gases influence global temperatures, each pushing and pulling in different directions. And so, while carbon dioxide (CO2) continues its slow and steady climb upward, global temperatures move in fits and starts, showing rapid warming over some periods and slow warming over others; and in some cases the warming going on hiatus for a while. (See graphic above).So a pause in warming even as CO2 continues to rise is not at all unusual. But the current pause, now approaching 10-15 years in duration, is beginning to look a bit unusual. With one exception, discussed below, it has lasted longer than any other pause we've seen since the late 1800s.Why Is It Happening?The fact is we don't really know why the global temperature climb is on a hiatus. The consensus is that it probably has something to do with extra heat going into the ocean driven by so-called \"internal variability.\" Here's how the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sums it up [pdf]:\"The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998-2012 as compared to the period 1951-2012, is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from internal variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium confidence).\"Of course such an explanation begs the question: what internal variability? What is going on inside the climate system that is causing global temperatures to respond in this way? One interesting explanation that has surfaced in recent months starts by positing that the current hiatus is linked to an earlier hiatus that also lasted for a more than a decade.An Earlier HiatusThis earlier hiatus ran through the middle of the 20th century. See \"Hiatus 1\" in the graphic above. At the time we knew far less about the climate, and scientists were even more flummoxed about what was going on then than we are now. For example, there was some concern -- but no consensus -- about global cooling.Eventually, the hiatus ended and the warming trend renewed (at an even faster pace). But scientists continued to puzzle over the cause of the hiatus. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, with our growing understanding of the role of aerosols in the climate, the general consensus grew that the stalled warming in the mid-20th century could be laid at the feet of air pollution. Emissions, primarily from the burning of coal, increase the atmospheric burden of suspended particulates (or aerosols) that cool and that, therefore, can counteract the effect of greenhouse gases like CO2. The hiatus had arrived in the late 1940s when the rapid growth of the then coal-dependent economies of the United States and Europe began to spew huge amounts of pollution into the atmosphere. When these countries began to clean up their air-pollution act (e.g., the Clean Air Act of 1970 in the United States), emissions decreased, the cooling effect shrank, greenhouse warming took over, and the rise in global temperatures began again in earnest.So that was then and this is now, and we are faced with trying to figure the cause of another long-running hiatus. Scientists have advanced a plethora of ideas. Most of these treat the current hiatus as a phenomenon essentially unrelated to previous hiatuses. But what if the mid-20th century hiatus and our current hiatus are not unrelated? What if they are caused by the same thing?One possibility that has been proposed is that the current hiatus is being caused again by air pollution, this time from China and other developing nations (see also here).Another possible explanation posits that the mid-20th century and current hiatus periods share a common climatic trigger: the internal variability in the climate system known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO.The Atlantic Multidecadal OscillationThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines the AMO like so:\"an ongoing series of long-duration changes in the sea surface temperature [SST] of the North Atlantic Ocean, with cool and warm phases that may last for 20-40 years at a time and a difference of about 1\u00b0F between extremes. These changes are natural and have been occurring for at least the last 1,000 years.\"Basically we're talking about an oscillatory type of behavior where for a while the sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic are relatively warm and then they're relatively cool.Why does the Atlantic oscillate like that? I don't think we really know although it\u2019s generally believed to be related to variations in the deep ocean circulation.How does the AMO relate to the hiatus? Well, just prior to the extended cool period in the 1960s and '70s, the AMO began to cool (that is, go from a warm phase to a cool phase); and, interestingly enough, the current lull in warming also seems to correspond to the onset of a cooling period in the AMO.Coincidence? No, wrote Ka-Kit Tung and Jiansong Zhou of the University of Washington in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science back in January. Using temperature reconstructions going back more than 300 years, the authors were able to show that decadal temperature oscillations like those seen with the AMO in the 20th century predate anthropogenic warming going back some 300 years.The AMO\u2019s Push and PullThe authors conclude that anthropogenic forcing is alive and well in the climate system and exerts a \u201cremarkably steady\u201d warming trend on global temperatures. That steady trend, however, is being obscured by the oscillatory overlay from the AMO. Tung and Zhou write: \"The presence of multidecadal internal variability (i.e., the AMO) superimposed on the secular trend (from greenhouse gases) gives the appearance of accelerated warming and cooling episodes at roughly regular intervals.\"Let me translate by way of a hypothetical real-world scenario. Imagine you are running a race. For 20 minutes the wind is in your face, and then for 20 minutes it's on your back. You keep running at the same pace but to the folks in the stands cheering you on, you appear to be running slower for 20 minutes and then faster. In a strong wind you may even appear to have stopped running all together, but you haven't. Similarly, if Tung and Zhou are correct, it may appear that warming has stopped, but it hasn't really. And like you running with the wind at your back, once the AMO shifts back to its other phase, the warming will accelerate, reflecting not only anthropogenic forcing but also the added push from the AMO itself.Enter the North Atlantic OscillationA new wrinkle to this storyline was added last week by Jianping Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, and co-authors in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. That new wrinkle is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) -- a phenomenon similar to the El Nino Southern Oscillation involving a shifting of high and low pressure systems in the Atlantic (instead of the Pacific) Ocean. These authors argue that the NAO-induced turbulence triggers a 15-20 year process that leads to a switch between the warming and cooling phases of the AMO. And the NAO can therefore be used as a predictor of the future state of the AMO and, if AMO cooling is tied to a dampening of climate change, it can also be used to infer the length of a given hiatus. And on that basis they predict that the current hiatus will be with us through 2027.That's quite a prediction -- I admire scientists willing to go out on a limb -- and wouldn't it be fortunate if that prediction proved true. But before you get too carried away, you should keep a few things in mind. In the first place, both Tung and Zhou's and Li et al.'s works are largely based on statistical manipulation of temperature records to show correlations -- there's not a whole lot of explanation by way of physical mechanisms. And don't forget that correlations establish a potential connection between phenomenon, not a cause and effect. Moreover, there are a number of scientists who find potential flaws in Tung and Zhou's analysis -- see here and here.Still, I find a certain elegance in the Tung and Zhou AMO-hiatus concept. And if true, it would give us a bit more time to get our low-carbon economy in gear. But, let's just not forget what a hiatus is -- it's a temporary pause. If we are lucky enough to get a multi-decadal pause in warming, we should use it to prepare because the warming will be back.Keep up with TheGreenGrok | Like us on Facebook"}, {"title": "Renewable Resources: We Sorely Need to Develop a Culture that Embraces Them", "text": "What's draining U.S. energy resources faster than any other product or technology? Cars? Lighting? HVAC? Refrigeration?None of the above.The little things in life are the nation's fastest-growing energy drains, such as computers, printers, TVs, vending machines, DVD players, ceiling fans and more of the like--especially devices that are always on. Taken together, they generate what energy analysts call Miscellaneous Energy Loads, or MELs. America's MELs are already bigger than the primary energy consumption of almost every other nation, notes a just-released report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) on Miscellaneous Energy Loads (MELs) in Buildings--and are growing more quickly than any other energy use category in the country.More significantly, energy is only one of the many resources we use excessively on a routine basis. There's also water, as I noted recently in a Huffington Post article, \"Water: The Most Critical Asset in Your Production Strategy,\" as well as all the commodities derived from plants and animals, and fossil fuels. While the latter is limited by supply, the others are not because they are renewable resources that if managed well will never be depleted.In an ideal world, all of the resources we use would be renewable. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway, voiced this concept in 1987 when she authored the landmark report, \"Our Common Future,\" which noted the critical importance of \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"Unfortunately, our ideal world has been a long time coming, but not for want of trying. Over the last 26 years, three high-level major global conferences aimed at preventing the destruction of the planet's irreplaceable natural resources followed Brundtland's report: the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and last year's Rio+20.Hopefully, the push for further reliance on renewable resources may finally be taking hold in the U.S. This summer, President Obama released an ambitious 2013 Climate Action Plan, which makes a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020; double current U.S. renewable energy production by 2020; and double U.S. energy efficiency relative to 2010 standards by 2030. And in August, to 'practice what he preached,' he re-installed the solar panels on the White House that were originally put up by President Carter and removed by President Reagan.These are heady, and admirable, ambitions. But the U.S. has far to go. According to the respected 2012 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) put out by researchers at Yale and Columbia Universities with the World Economic Forum and European Commission--which ranks countries on how close they are globally to established environmental policy goals--the U.S. ranks 49 out of 132. This assessment is based on the nation's environmental stresses to human health, ecosystem conditions and natural resource management. That's far below all other G6 nations and a surprising host of developing nations. Even worse, our Trend EPI rank, which indicates how quickly we're moving up, falls even lower at 77.So how can the U.S. catch up?Brundtland had it right; renewable resources are key. The world population is growing and so is the demand for already scarce natural resources. It is critical to tap the available--and vast--supplies of renewable resources we have here. And more significantly, we must learn to manage them astutely, systematically and equitably so they aren't wasted. There are many considerations to do this:1. New game plans to use and conserve renewable resources are going to require a massive cultural shift that has to start with education. There is still low awareness and a lot of confusion around the term renewability and the concept of renewable resources at all levels. As a result, we need to start focusing on schooling businesses and consumers alike on the relevance and benefits of using renewable resources.2. In a resource-constrained world, it's key for industry to limit its dependence on nonrenewable resources. We need to move away from the linear model--'take, make, dispose'--to a restorative, circular economy where renewable resources are used efficiently and effectively. We all know about the three Rs--reduce, reuse and recycle--but a circular economy goes further. It combines cleaner production, comprehensive utilization of resources, eco-design and sustainable consumption to forge a multi-win model that reconciles our economic, environmental and developmental objectives.3. Government and industry needs to put plans in place to grow programs and implement processes to ensure that products are designed with the environment and renewability in mind from the start and not just as an afterthought. In addition, everyone along the supply chain must think holistically, which means selecting materials, ingredients and products that are sourced responsibly from replenishable resources. At Tetra Pak, we use the greatest possible proportion of renewable materials in our packages. Our cartons, on average, are made of more than 70 percent paperboard, a renewable resource from selectively harvested and regrown trees; we have launched bio- based plastic caps made from polyethylene from sugar cane; and our goal is to offer packages made from 100 percent renewable materials.4. The use of forests as a source of raw material can sometimes be questioned. How can it make good environmental sense to cut down trees? The first consideration is that the alternative would be to use more nonrenewable resources. Therefore, using forest-based products that are continuously replenished makes a significantly better net contribution to the environment. Of course, there are forests that have such a high environmental or social value that they should not be touched. These forests must be identified and protected by the forest owner and/or government. This is an important part of responsible forest management, which is fully supported by Tetra Pak.5. There is a need to step up programs and create new ones where necessary to identify products made with responsibly sourced renewable resources. Some successful examples of these efforts include the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and the Forest Stewardship Council's certification program.And it is not about just using renewable resources--but also using the least amount of them. So, focusing on efficiencies is key. It is critical to lower and streamline the use of every resource possible throughout the whole lifecycle of a product, from conceptualizing to manufacturing to end of life.America is a fierce competitor and has always taken note of, and tried to address, its deficits. However, this problem requires not only global leadership, but also collaboration, as President Obama has rightly noted. America is moved by powerful shifts in human thought, and to me, renewable resources is an issue needing to be rethought as it affects everyone and everything and impacts our businesses. So let's move beyond symbolic gestures and make the most of the renewable resources we already have."}, {"title": "New System Could Predict How Climate Change Will Affect Future Fishing Conditions", "text": "Fishermen often find themselves at the mercy of conditions that exist well outside of their control: extreme weather, temperature, breeding cycles, fuel prices, dock prices for their catch and so much more.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Schwarzenegger Recognized By U.S. Forest Service As Honorary Ranger", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Michael d'Estries:One of the nation's most exclusive clubs just received a new member.   Actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarznegger was named a honorary ranger by the U.S. Forest Service this week. The 66-year-old received the designation for his continued leadership on climate change. He joins actress Betty White and MNN co-founder and Rolling Stones keyboardist Chuck Leavell as the only other honorary rangers in the agency's history.   \"Thanks to Governor Schwarzenegger, California is now well on its way to meetings its targets through a ground-breaking mix of measures, including a low carbon fuel standard, a renewable energy portfolio, and a cap-and-trade program,\" the release states. \"Governor Schwarzenegger also approved tough new vehicle fuel economy standards that have since been adopted at the national level.\"  The Forest Service also honored Schwarzenegger's achievements after public office, including the co-founding the non-profit R20 Regions of Climate Change - which \"helps governments develop projects to lower carbon emissions and to make forests and other ecosystems more resilient\u2014more able to recover from the impacts of climate change.Thomas Tidwell (L) and Hank Kashdan (R) of the U.S. Forest Service pose for a photo with Betty White who was named an honorary Forest Ranger at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on November 9, 2010 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Paul Morigi/WireImage)The idea for honorary rangers in the U.S. Forest Service is a relatively new one. When Betty White was asked during an interview what she might have pursued if not for acting, she immediately responded with forest ranger. Unfortunately, the agency did not hire women during her time. Nonetheless, a bright mind in the Forest Service communications department read White's comment and thought the title of honorary ranger would both a great way to grant the actress's wish and also bring more attention to the agency.   Upon receiving the honor in 2010, White said: \"Wilderness is harder and harder to find these days on this beautiful planet, and we're abusing our planet to the point of almost no return. In my heart I've been a forest ranger all my life, but now I'm official.\"  Last year, Leavell became the second honorary ranger in recognition of his contributions to conservation (Leavell co-owns a 2,500-acre pine tree plantation in central Georgia) as well as continued leadership and environemental activism through efforts like the Mother Nature Network.   \u201cTrees and forests are the lifeblood of our country. They give us so much,\u201d Leavell said. \u201cWe have many challenges to keep our American forests healthy\u2026and yet the forests have proven to be exceptionally resilient, it\u2019s up to us to keep it that way.\u201d  You can watch Leavell accepting the award below."}, {"title": "Climate Change Is Killing The Wolves Of Isle Royale. Should The Government Save Them?", "text": "When it comes to the wilderness of Isle Royale National Park, located in the northwest corner of Lake Superior, the wolves have always had the run of things.Only accessible to humans by boat or seaplane, Isle Royale is the least-visited national park in the continental United States. Last year, only 16,746 visitors made the journey.Isle Royale National Park. The least visited National Park, the population of 1200 moose exceeds the number of people for most of the year. The park preserves 132,018 acres of land-based wilderness. Photo via Getty.But climate change is threatening the wild wolves who once lived with moose in blissful solitude in this remote preserved land, many say. Ice bridges once connected Isle Royale to Ontario, allowing animals to cross back and forth almost every other year.Since scientists began keeping records in 1973, ice accumulation in the Great Lakes has declined by 30 percent. An ice bridge may only form once every 15 years now. Lake Superior is warming faster than any large lake on the planet.With an ice bridge becoming increasingly rare, those wolves have become \"critically isolated,\" the Lansing State Journal reported. As many as 50 once roamed the island, though scientists think 25 is a more reasonable baseline number, according to the Wildlife News.Only eight adult wolves are left. Two or three pups may have been born this summer.In this photo released by Michigan Technological University, a gray wolf is shown on Isle Royale National Park in northern Michigan, Feb. 24, 2006. (AP Photo/Michigan Technological University, John Vucetich)The wolves' and moose hunter-hunted relationship is the longest continuous study of any predator-prey system in the world. The park's research project notes how uncharacteristically warm temperatures can greatly disturb the balance between moose and wolf pack populations on Isle Royale:Then, a series of very hot summers struck. During hot summers moose feed less, as they spent more time resting in the shade. Having fed less, the undernourished moose were less prepared to survive the winters. Warm temperatures also enabled severe outbreaks of moose tick. Weakened by heat and ticks, moose dropped to their lowest observed levels. Wolves took advantage of weakened moose, fueling high rates of predation. During the first decade of the 21st century, the moose population steadily slid to its lowest levels.Those wolves who are left are suffering, the Lansing State Journal says. Generations of inbreeding, with no ice bridges to introduce new wolves to the island, have bred genetic deformities in the animals. The deformity gives them misshapen, heavy backs and makes breeding even more difficult.Some have called for the National Park Service to introduce new wolves into the dwindling Isle Royale pack.It would be the first time the National Park Service has ever taken deliberate action determine the fate of a species at one of its parks. Whether that role belongs to the Park Service has ignited debate in the scientific community.A gray wolf is shown on Isle Royale National Park in northern Michigan, Feb. 24, 2006. (AP Photo/Michigan Technological University, John Vucetich)\"Is it the Park Service's role to feed science if it isn't consistent with managing native species?\" wondered the NPCA Park Advocate. Dr. Dave Mech, who previously researched the wolves on Isle Royale, told the Park Advocate he's not convinced the wolves will go extinct and thinks officials should \"wait and see.\" From an evolutionary perspective, moose and wolves are relative newcomers to the island. Many believe nature alone should deliver the fate of the island wolves.But John Vucetich, a researcher on the island, says that a genetic rescue is critical -- not only for animals, but the entire Isle Royale ecosystem, designated a protected biosphere reserve in 1981 for its pristine lake forest wilderness.\"The one thing on which there is universal agreement,\" Vucetich told the Lansing State Journal, \"is that wherever there are large ungulates like moose or deer or elk, there needs to be a top predator to maintain ecosystem integrity.\"One Republican Congressman, Sen. Tom Coburn, thinks Isle Royale isn't worth the money spent to keep it open, wolves or no wolves. In his report, \u201cParked: How Congress\u2019 Misplaced Priorities Are Trashing Our National Treasures,\u201d he blasted Isle Royale and other remote national parks, like the Upper Peninsula's Keweenaw National Historic Park, as some of the \u201cmore egregious, wasteful or otherwise questionable expenses\u201d to be found in America. Isle Royale has an annual operating budget of $4.35 million, according to the report.CORRECTION: The report on Isle Royale wolves was mistakenly attributed to the Detroit Free Press. It was originally published by the Lansing State Journal and reprinted by the Detroit Free Press.

There is an interesting new article by Rosenthal and collaborators in the latest issue of the journal Science entitled \"Pacific Ocean Heat Content During the Past 10,000 Years\" that attempts to address this question. The article compares current rates of ocean warming with long-term paleoclimatic evidence from ocean sediments. So how rapid is the ocean warming? Well, for the Pacific ocean at least, faster than any other time in at least the past 10,000 years.The study finds, specifically, that (to quote Columbia University's press release) the \"middle depths [of the Pacific Ocean] have warmed 15 times faster in the last 60 years than they did during apparent natural warming cycles in the previous 10,000\".Beyond that key overall take-home conclusion, though, there are some enigmatic aspects of the study. The authors argue for substantial differences between proxy reconstructions of surface temperature and their new sediment core evidence of intermediate water temperatures from the tropical IndoPacific, during the past two millenia. The researchers argue that recent warmth is anomalous in the former case, but not the latter. They argue that, while the present rate of ocean warming is unprecedented, the actual level of ocean heat content (which depends not just on surface temperature, but also sub-surface ocean temperatures) is not as high as during Medieval times, i.e. during what they term the \"Medieval Warm Period\" (this is a somewhat outdated term; The term \"Medieval Climate Anomaly\" is generally favored by climate scientists because of the regionally variable pattern of surface temperatures changes in past centuries--more on this later).One complication with their comparison is that the dramatic warming of the past half century is not evident in the various sediment data analyzed in the study. \"Modern\" conditions are typically defined by the \"tops\" of the sediment core obtained by drilling down below the ocean bottom. But sediment core tops are notoriously bad estimates of \"current\" climate conditions because of various factors, including the limited temporal resolution owing to slow sediment deposition rates, and processes that mix and smear information at the top of the core. Core tops for these reasons tend not to record the most recent climate changes. Thus, the researchers' data do not explicitly resolve the large recent increases in temperature (and heat content). But if the warming of the past half century is not resolved by their data, then the assumption that those data can be registered against a common modern baseline (the authors use a reference period of 1965-1970) too is suspect. That registration is critical to their conclusion that modern heat content has not exceeded the bounds of the past two millennia.There are also some puzzling inconsistencies between the authors' current conclusions and other previously published evidence implying a very different pattern of global ocean heat content changes over the past two millennia. Current global sea level has been shown to be unprecedented for at least the past two millennia in previous work using both proxy-based sea level reconstructions and predictions from \"semi-empirical\" models of sea level change. Thermal expansion due to sub-surface ocean warming is a substantial contributor to the observed rise this century in global sea level. It is thus difficult to reconcile the observation that modern sea level is unprecedented over at least the past two millennia with the authors' claim that there has not been an anomalous increase in global ocean heat content over this time frame. Given that there is unlikely to have been any sea level rise contribution from melting ice sheets prior to the most recent decades, any explanation would have to involve extremely large sea level contributions from the melting of small glaciers and ice caps, contributions that exceed what is actually evident in the climate record.Finally, we need to maintain a healthy skepticism about broad conclusions about global climate drawn from one specific region like the tropical IndoPacific. It is surprising in this context that the article didn't mention or cite two studies published in the same journal (Science), a few years ago: Mann et al (2009) and Trouet et al (2009) which demonstrate a high degree of regional heterogeneity in global temperature changes over the past millennium. Both studies attribute much of that heterogeneity to dynamical climate responses related to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. The tropical Pacific appears to have been in an anomalous La Ni\u00f1a-like state during the Medieval era. During such a state, which is the flip-side of El Ni\u00f1o, much of the tropical Pacific (the eastern and central tropical Pacific) is unusually cold. But the tropical western Pacific and IndoPacific are especially warm. That makes it perilous to draw inferences about global-scale warmth from this region (see this more detailed discussion at RealClimate).There a few other minor, odd things about the study. In a figure comparing the sediment records with proxy reconstructions of surface temperature, the authors attribute one of the curves to \"Mann 2003\" in the figure legend. This would appear to be a reference to a rather old reconstruction by Mann and Jones (2003), which is supplanted by a newer, far more comprehensive study by Mann et al (2008). The authors indeed cite this latter study in footnote of the figure caption. So it is unclear which reconstruction is actually being shown, and the comparison is potentially inappropriate. The authors, in a different figure, show a recent, longer albeit somewhat more tenuous reconstruction of global temperature over the past 11,000 years by Marcott et al (2013), published in Science earlier this year. That reconstruction was observed to be consistent with that of Mann et al (2008) during the interval of overlap of the past two millennia.It is also puzzling that the article doesn't show or even cite the most comprehensive hemispheric reconstruction to date, that of the PAGES 2K consortium published in the journal Nature Geoscience two months before the present paper was submitted to Science. That reconstruction demonstrates modern warming to considerably exceed the peak warmth of the Medieval period, closely resembling the original Mann et al \"Hockey Stick\". It would have been useful to see all of these reconstructions, each of which demonstrate recent warmth to be anomalous in a long-term context, compared on the same graph against the sediment series of this study.In summary, the Rosenthal study is interesting and it provides useful new paleoclimate data that give us an incrementally richer understanding of the details of climate changes in pre-historic times. However, there are a number of inconsistencies with other evidence, and debatable assumptions and interpretations, which will require sorting out by the scientific community. That is, of course, the \"self-correcting\" machinery of science that Carl Sagan spoke so eloquently of."}, {"title": "Feline Frenzy Goes Beyond YouTube Videos -- to Animal Control Agencies", "text": "Cats had already taken over the internet -- so their next stop just had to be a trendy Brooklyn neighborhood. The Internet Cat Video Festival came to Williamsburg in New York City on Oct. 25 and drew thousands of people, including many wearing fuzzy ears and whiskers.It's not surprising the event was such a success -- the U.S. has long been a nation of cat lovers. And it's not just socialized pet cats like the festival's special guest, Lil Bub, who are popular: Feral cats who call the outdoors their home have stolen the hearts of Americans too. Millions of Americans care for these beautiful and independent creatures who are not socialized to people and live in colonies with other cats.Feral cats, also called community cats, are the focus of a humane approach to animal control that is steadily gaining momentum in communities nationwide: Trap-Neuter-Return, or TNR. The old approach for feral cats was catch and kill, where the healthy cats were rounded up and \"euthanized\" at shelters. But catch and kill has failed at stabilizing the feral cat population -- and as you might guess based on Americans' love for cats -- it doesn't go over well with the vast majority of community members who don't want their tax dollars spent on killing animals.Fortunately, some animal control authorities are now replacing this outdated method with TNR, an approach that works and has the wholehearted support of cat lovers. This approach involves humanely trapping feral cats, spaying/neutering and vaccinating them, eartipping them for identification and then returning them to their homes outdoors.Within just the past decade, the number of municipalities with ordinances supporting TNR has increased tenfold. In fact, 350 cities and counties now officially endorse TNR -- and that number increases monthly.Cities and towns are adopting TNR because they've seen how effective it is at reducing community cat populations. In these communities, animal control officers' phones are ringing less often, fewer kittens are being brought to shelters and cat colony sizes are shrinking.For example, since San Jose Animal Care & Services in California launched its innovative TNR program in 2010, its intake rates for cats and kittens have fallen by 25 percent. In addition to saving lives, this approach can save money. San Jose spends $50 to spay/neuter, vaccinate, eartip, and return a cat. That's about a quarter of what it costs the shelter to hold, care for and kill a cat.As a result of the resounding success of TNR, many communities that still catch and kill feral cats want to learn how they can implement this humane program in their area. That's why Alley Cat Allies is hosting a national conference November 8 - 10 near Washington, D.C., to bring together the nation's top TNR experts who will discuss how to advance the momentum for TNR and other humane policies and programs for cats. Leading veterinarians, shelter directors, animal control officers and other visionaries who have transformed communities' approaches to cats will share their insight at our Architects of Change for Cats conference. The goal is to share success stories, provide proven \"blueprints\" for change and keep up the momentum to protect the lives of cats.The animal control agencies and shelters that have already changed their approach to feral cats are seeing amazing results. But we need every agency and shelter to follow suit. Change isn't always easy -- but it is necessary. And with hundreds of municipalities to look to for inspiration, and community members who love cats and are willing to help shelters make the change, there's no reason to wait another day. Our conference speakers, who may not wear fuzzy cat ears but are just as passionate about cats as the Internet Cat Video festivalgoers, will show attendees the way.---Becky Robinson is the President and Co-Founder of Alley Cat Allies, the only national advocacy organization dedicated to the protection and humane treatment of cats."}, {"title": "Arizona Commissioner Probes Utility's Secret Funding Of Anti-Solar Campaign", "text": "An Arizona utility commissioner is asking for all the key players in a debate over a solar energy policy in the state to reveal any additional secret funding of nonprofits or public relations campaigns. The probe comes after Arizona Public Service, the state's largest utility, admitted last week that it had been secretly contributing to outside nonprofits running negative ads against solar power.As The Huffington Post reported Friday, APS recently admitted that it had lied for months about paying the 60 Plus Association, a national conservative organization backed by the Koch brothers, to run ads against current solar net-metering policy.

The organization says an undercover private investigator collected first-hand evidence, including video footage, of inhumane treatment of pigs raised and slaughtered at the facility.The hidden-camera footage appears to show pregnant pigs confined in tiny \"gestation crates,\" pigs being punched and abused, and piglets being thrown on their heads and mutilated without anesthetic.Although the Pipestone County Sheriff\u2019s Office told The Huffington Post it found \"no evidence of animal neglect or abuse\" during its search, the nonprofit's video has led to independent investigations by Walmart and Pipestone System.Watch the video here: (WARNING: Content is extremely graphic and may disturb some viewers)Matt Rice, the director of investigations at Mercy for Animals, told HuffPost the investigator -- whose identity has been kept private -- spent 10 weeks posing as an employee at Rosewood Farms earlier this year.Animals were found to be living in \"nightmarish conditions,\" Rice said over the phone Wednesday.\"Pregnant pigs are confined in tiny metal crates that are just barely big enough to hold them,\" he said of the factory farm. \"They're basically immobile for their entire lives. They can't turn around, they can't lie down comfortably, and they suffer from large open wounds and pressure sores from rubbing against the bars.\"Many of these sows \"typically go mad in these conditions,\" Rice added. \"They smash their heads against the bars and bite them out of stress and frustration.\"Pregnant pigs in gestation crates at Rosewood Farms (Screenshot/Mercy for Animals)Rice calls these gestation crates -- banned in the European Union and in nine U.S. states, including California, Colorado, Florida and Arizona -- \"one of the most cruel forms of institutionalized cruelty.\"Unlike more than 60 other major retailers, including Kroger, McDonald's, Safeway, Costco and Kmart, which have all refused to work with pork suppliers that use gestation crates, Walmart has not instituted such a policy.\"We're calling on Walmart to take a stand against this blatant animal abuse and to do what their competitors have already done,\" Rice said.Pork producers have long maintained that gestation crates have many benefits that make them useful. For instance, the crates are said to allow for better management of individual sows and to protect the animals from the aggression of other pigs. Last year, the New York Times reported that \"about 60 to 70 percent of the more than five million breeding sows\" in the U.S. are kept in these crates.Commenting on this issue, Danit Marquardt, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told HuffPost:This is a complicated issue [...] We are currently engaged with pork suppliers, food safety experts and other organizations to work towards an industry-wide model that is not only respectful of farmers and animals, but also meets our customers\u2019 expectations for quality and animal safety.In addition to gestation crates, Mercy for Animals says the investigator found evidence of other inhumane practices at Rosewood Farms.Boars who are kept for breeding purposes are kept in similarly tiny crates, Rice said, and animals who are sent to be slaughtered are forced to live in cramped pens, where they are deprived of sunlight and fresh air for their entire lives.In the video above, narrated by \"Babe\" actor James Cromwell, employees of the farm appear to be cutting off the tails and testicles of piglets without anesthetic.\"Pigs are widely thought to be one of the world's smartest animals,\" Rice said. \"They are incredibly intelligent and social, and are able to feel joy and pain and suffering just as dogs and cats do. Yet, they are subject to such needless cruelty.\"An employee is seen grabbing several piglets by their feet at Rosewood Farms (Screenshot/Mercy For Animals)Commenting specifically on the employees' seemingly haphazard handling of animals seen in undercover video, both Pipestone System and Walmart have expressed outrage. The companies have also vowed to address the allegations of abuse.\"Pipestone System does not condone any type of willful animal abuse,\" the company said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. Pipestone added that it has conducted an internal investigation into the alleged mistreatment of animals, which resulted in the \"immediate termination of one employee, reassignment of another and follow-up training of the remaining employees.\"A Walmart rep told HuffPost the company is conducting its own investigation into the allegations of abuse.\"The animal handling in this video is unacceptable,\" the rep said, adding that a \"new comprehensive auditing and tracking program for pork\" -- which promises to help ensure that the company purchases pork only from farms that are \"certified to meet the highest standards for the treatment of animals\" -- is scheduled to roll out in the coming weeks.The nonprofit says it has conducted at least two dozen such undercover investigations at factory farms, dairy farms, hatcheries and slaughterhouses in recent years -- three of which, including the most recent at Rosewood, were at Walmart pork suppliers.\"Every single time, our investigators have brought back images that would horrify most Americans,\" Rice said. \"This is a sign that mutilating animals without anesthesia and confining them in cages so small they can't turn around are considered standard industry practice.\"A major problem, says Rice, is that though there are federal laws in place to guard against animal cruelty, many states have \"common farming exemptions.\" In other words, farm practices that may otherwise be seen as inhumane are perfectly legal so long as they are considered standard policy in the farming world.This means, Rice says, that a large proportion of the roughly 9 billion animals that are raised annually for human consumption in the United States may be subject to cruelty.\"Change starts with awareness.

It would be kind of irresponsible to say go ahead and go outside,\" said Trevor Boucher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Nashville, Tennessee. He said his office was getting a lot of calls from city and county officials trying to decide whether to proceed with Halloween activities.In one neighborhood southeast of Austin, the rains caused a creek that normally runs at about 7 feet to swell more than five times its normal size. It was expected to crest at a record 41 feet by Thursday afternoon before receding, Zeitler said.\"For certain areas, it looks like this will be in their top 10 (flood events) of all time,\" Zeitler said.No injuries had been reported but entire neighborhoods near swollen creeks were being evacuated. Residents in some of the more hilly areas were forced to sandbag their doorsteps.Shelters were being set up at schools, community centers and churches for residents displaced by the storms. The floods closed down MetroRail service for northwest Austin for part of the morning commute.The storm was partly caused by Hurricane Raymond, which dissipated in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. Its remnants moved across the western United States, pulling heavy weather with them.That combined with warm, humid, low-lying air from the Gulf of Mexico and cooler air at higher altitudes to produce the floods - a situation expected to return next week with more potential flooding from a tropical storm brewing in the same region, Zeitler said.Central Texas, which draws crowds of nature lovers to its rolling hills and hundreds of creeks and rivers, has earned the nickname \"Flash Flood Alley.\"The last time many of these neighborhoods saw this level of flooding was in 1998, when massive floods killed more than two dozen people and caused $750 million worth of damage from Austin to San Antonio and beyond.Thursday's floods came just two weeks after the remnants of Tropical Storm Octave washed over Austin and caused massive flooding in the downtown area, with over a foot of rain washing out the city's annual Austin City Limits music festival.

But even as a conservative number, it's shocking.Meat's climate change impact makes intuitive sense: First, it's simply inefficient to grow crops and feed them to animals so that we can eat the animals. Most of those calories are burned off by the animals metabolically, so that we have to grow far more crops if we're feeding them to animals than if we're eating them directly.Second, there are far more stages of production for meat than for plants, including: transporting the grain and soy to feed mills, operating the feed mills, trucking the feed to animal farms, operating the animal farms, trucking the animals to slaughter, operating the slaughterhouses, trucking the meat to processing plants, operating the processing plants, and so on.Some of those stages are required for plant-based foods, of course (veggie burgers don't grow on trees), but meat requires multiple extra stages of production, with all the energy needs and pollution entailed in the additional transport and factories, even beyond the basic inefficiency of funneling crops through animals.The FAO report tries to be positive, suggesting that through \"collective, concerted and global action,\" we can reduce the amount of climate change caused by the global meat industry by 30 percent. The authors explain that such an effort will require cooperation from \"all sector stakeholders (private and public sector, civil society, research and academia, and international organizations).\"Um, just how likely do you think that is?Fortunately, though unlikely, it's also not necessary.The November/December Mother Jones cover asks hopefully, \"Will Silicon Valley Put Factory Farms Out of Business?\" Inside, we read the story of venture capital backed endeavors to replace eggs with pea protein and to place a faux chicken in every pot, courtesy of Bill Gates, Biz Stone, and other forward-thinking titans of the tech industry.It shouldn't surprise anyone that Biz Stone, Evan Williams, and Bill Gates are investing in and promoting plant-based eggs and chicken, and that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is investing in and promoting cultured meat. MoJo explains that the \"chicken\" in which Gates has invested, for example, is 18 times more efficient at providing nutrition than eating actual birds. Brin's product, although further from the marketplace, is even more efficient.In other words, switching from chicken to Beyond Meat's \"chicken\" will reduce caloric inefficiency by 94 percent; that's quite a bit better than the 30 percent we can achieve for the meat industry through the Herculean efforts suggested by the FAO report, and all it requires is a change in eating habits.That explains why Gates, Stone, Williams, Brin, and a growing cadre of venture capitalists, especially those with an environmental and philanthropic bent, are getting behind these faux meats and eggs. If they can convince Americans to eat plant-based chicken instead of its feathery (and fleshy, and bloody) counterpart, the results could be transformative -- for both our diets and our planet.Obviously, global climate change is a challenge to humanity greater than any in human history, and dealing with it is going to require the ingenuity of our world's greatest minds. It's not a problem that lends itself to small-scale thinking or small scale solutions.But those of us who believe that the personal is political needn't wait for the Gates Foundation to solve the problem; we can begin to live in accordance with our environmental values today by leaving the most environmentally wasteful foods off our plates and replacing them with more efficient foods.Thanks to forward-thinkers like Bill Gates and Biz Stone, that's just gotten a little bit easier and tastier.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyThe Author Discusses Tissue-Engineered Meat With Ezra Klein on All In with Chris Hayes"}, {"title": "Is Your Nest Egg Radioactive?", "text": "What I like about renewable energy is that when it fails, we don't have radioactive fish.Two years after the March 11, 2011 tsunami, the Fukushima nuclear power plant is a problem, with 400 tons of water contaminated every day (and stored in more containers than could fit in Yankee Stadium).

The company had to be bailed out by Japan and has become a curse world for the world.General Electric designed the Mark I containment system, which failed at the Fukushima power plant. In fairness, it's hard for anything to survive a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami, which is why renewable, less toxic energy costs less by every measure -- from dollars and cents, to dollars and sense, to health, and to our planet -- than radioactive isotopes. This is not a Tree Hugger idea. It is a reality that many companies on our side of the Pacific are now facing up to. The decommissioning of nuclear power plants has begun in the U.S., and in a manner so quiet that investors may not even realize they hold a radioactive investment portfolio.On June 7, 2013, Southern California Edison (SCE) announced plans to permanently retire Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. On October 16, 2013, SCE accused Mitsubishi of designing defective replacement steam generators, \"a failure which led to the permanent shutdown of the plant and caused billions of dollars in harm,\" according to SCE's press release. I wouldn't want to be holding any of SCE's preferred stock right now, even though SCE has reassured their investors that SCE's cost of the decommissioning will only be $3 billion, of which $2.7 billion has already been collected, and that customers will pick up the tab of any shortfall. TEPCO is stark proof that the mandatory decommissioning funds held by utility companies can be a rounding error of the true cost of containing radioactive waste.On August 27, 2013, Entergy Corporation announced plans to mothball its Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station in Vernon, VT. Entergy says it has enough funds set aside for the decommissioning process, however additional funds will be needed for spent fuel handling and storage. The decommissioning decision was \"driven by sustained low power prices, high cost structure and wholesale electricity market design flaws for Vermont Yankee plant,\" according to Entergy, in their press release.Dominion Nuclear is shutting down its 556-megawatt Kewaunee Power Station permanently \"based purely on economics,\" according to David Heacock, the president. Duke Energy recently abandoned a nuclear project in Florida. France's Electricite de France, one of the biggest nuclear investors in the world, has focused their sights on renewable energy in the U.S.Renewable energy has increased from 6 percent of the national consumption in 2000 to 9.3 percent today, while nuclear energy has been declining since its peak in 2007. (2007 was the highest energy usage year on record.) Judging from the mothballing that has begun this year, the exodus from nuclear and the renaissance of renewables are only beginning.Energy Consumption in the U.S. by Source Quadrillion BTU, in 2012Coal: 17.37 Natural Gas: 26.000  Petroleum: 34.688  Nuclear: 8.050  Total Renewable 8.825  Total All Energy 95.100  Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationCheaper renewable energy, human fallibility and natural disasters have pushed the cost of nuclear into the unaffordable, even for conservatives who are still iffy on the climate change data. That's ultimately good news for our planet (if it's not already too late). The bad news is for customers and investors, who will be picking up the tab. If you do not have a way of generating your own electricity, or using substantially less of it, you'll be paying more for electricity in the months and years to come.This is where solar panels and solar water heaters, at least for those living in sunny states, are very attractive investments, bringing with them tax credits and free energy for life. In most states, the utility company pays you when you produce more solar energy than you use. Solar products are much more affordable today than they were five years ago. Generating your own electricity is about the only way that you can avoid getting stuck with the tab for the nuclear decommissioning exodus that has begun.Learn more about how to reduce your energy bill in my book, The ABCs of Money.For investors, it's always a good idea to get out of the old and into the new. You wouldn't want to be invested in the horse and buggy when cars were invented, and you don't want to be left holding a bag of uranium when everyone else is solar gazing.It's hard to find a utility without any nuclear connection.

National Grid does not own or operate any nuclear power plants (though it does purchase energy for its customers in the northeastern part of the U.S.). National Grid has also been at the forefront for committing to more renewable energy in the U.S., distinguishing itself as one of the most forward-thinking green utilities.

I have plowed through reams of scientific studies in stages of despair and encouragement that this growing field may hold hope for \"regenerating damaged tissues and organs in the body,\" according to the National Institutes of Health, \"by stimulating previously irreparable organs to heal themselves.\"Regenerative medicine institutes abound in the U.S. and abroad, specializing in eye and heart diseases, tissue replacement to organs affected by cancer. Global demand for stem cells has created a multi-billion dollar market. Japan's government recently kicked in $1.7 billion for its regenerative medicine industry.Recent breakthroughs in stem cell research, such as last summer's study by the Oregon Health and Science University on patient-specific embryonic stem cells and therapeutic cloning, make headlines regularly now.But my son Massimo's future depends not only on these huge investments in regenerative medicine; his generation needs a similar investment in regenerating our ravaged ecosystems. Facing the silent tsunamis of climate change and environmental destruction, my son's planet is as scarred and imperiled as his sight.In a way, my total focus now on dealing with such damage goes back further than the diagnosis. My son was born four months after the tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean in 2004.Only days after the tsunami struck, I stood on a scarred beach on the tip of South India. Broken parts of lives and communities and landscapes, no longer coherent, were strewn in a way that seemed beyond rebuilding. The same shores I once saw from the plane, cloaked by palms, were literally swept away.And yet, after visiting Mitraniketan, a \"village regeneration\" project in the nearby western Ghat hills on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border, which had transformed a once deforested and impoverished community into a sustainable tropical forest village, I could not imagine any other place on earth that curried the still small possibility of hope for renewal.This small possibility of hope has sent me back to reconsider what I discovered in India.More than a half century ago, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore spoke of the power of stories as one the main ways for the \"regeneration of the Indian people,\" in a post-colonial nation, to \"educate them out of their trance.\"Nearly ten years ago, I broke from that \"trance\" on the devastated beaches of India by hearing the stories of how Mitraniketan brought its vibrant forests and community health back to life.Inspired by Tagore's belief that the \"source of regeneration, material and intellectual, is in the forest,\" Mitraniken emerged in 1956 from the efforts of a small group of determined children and Dalit (or lower caste) villagers in the Western Ghat hills of Kerala to begin the long process of healing and \"calling back the soil,\" and adapting modern science with traditional ways to reclaim and replant indigenous trees and sustainable agricultural plots. In the process, they embraced community and forest-centered education ideas as part of a larger cultural movement to regenerate villages that had been written off as hopeless wastelands.Ever since my trip, this photo of despair and determination on the deforested hillsides surrounding Mitraniketan in 1957 has sat on my desk as a reminder of the parable of regeneration in the most discouraging of times.Building the road to Mitraniketan, 1957. Photo courtesy of Mitraniketan.My son's health predicament has shaken me out of a similar trance today -- on many different levels.In the last year, I have held my son's hand on the banks of the Mississippi River, as we watched his native state of Illinois teeter on the extreme edges of climate change from a prolonged drought that brought the nation's greatest river to record low depths to an emergency state for spring flooding.Earlier this spring, we stood in the ruins of a reckless strip mine in a rare stand of old growth forest only 15 minutes from his birthplace in western Illinois that was recently granted a new permit, despite racking up over hundreds of Clean Water Act discharge violations into nearly waterways.Just like in India, I believe a key part of protecting my son's health is in defending his native forests, as Tagore admonished, as the source of regeneration and its \"diverse processes of renewal of life,\" and in finding success stories of regenerative medicine and environmental renewal.By nature, I think writers understand the role of regeneration in storytelling. In many respects, I consider our narrative work a literary process of recovery; the challenge of unearthing, exposing and shedding light on stories that give new life to historical realities considered to be lost or damaged.Trauma narrative and storytelling play a huge role in that process of recovery -- of returning to new, albeit changed, lives.If we look more deeply into our literary traditions, in fact, the narrative act has always defined the profound and at times dangerous role of renewal. As a penalty for bringing fire to humanity, Prometheus is chained to a rock in Greek mythology, where he watches in agony as his liver regenerates every night, only to be devoured by eagles.A modern-day update on that story: The Monash University's Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute put out a paper earlier this year on the role of immune cells in the salamanders' ability to regenerate arms and legs. The Institute's researcher optimistically called it a \"smoking gun\" to \"tweak the human wound-healing scenario.\"\"At the day's end, thou shalt see my scars and know that I had my wounds and also my healing,\" Tagore wrote.As I move forward as a writer, and as a father, my only hope now is that regeneration stories, like regenerative medicine, will continue to show ways our damaged health and ecosystems can heal themselves."}, {"title": "Power Play: A Plan To Connect The Electric Grids Of Oahu And Maui", "text": "In a major change that could effectively nix plans for the long-debated industrial-scale wind farm proposed for Lanai, state policymakers have in recent months shifted their interest toward connecting the Oahu and Maui electric grids.If the grid-link comes to fruition, it should allow more renewable energy to be brought online, help the state toward the goal of energy independence and potentially bring down electricity rates, say officials.Mark Glick, who heads the state energy office, told Civil Beat that it's highly unlikely that Hawaii would simultaneously pursue both the Lanai wind project and the Oahu-Maui grid connection. For now, it looks like it will be one or the other.The energy office administrator restated his view that the controversial Lanai project, which proposes to bring wind energy to Oahu via an undersea cable, is not essential to meeting Hawaii\u2019s mid-term renewable energy goals.Both projects are currently being debated before the Public Utilities Commission as developers make their case for each.Glick argues that the benefits of connecting Maui are far greater than for the cables proposed for Lanai and Molokai under the Big Wind project. And he thinks the Maui project can be executed in a way that prevents the sort of community opposition that has plagued Lanai and Molokai. (The Molokai portion of the project has since fallen apart.)\u201cThis isn\u2019t Oahu-centric,\u201d Glick said of the Maui-Oahu cable. \u201cThis is a statewide project. There are winners throughout and that\u2019s a different thing.\u201dWith the Lanai and Molokai wind farms, he noted, there were definite losers. On both islands, residents complained, among other things, that they were sacrificing their land and environment for wind farms that fed Oahu\u2019s huge hunger for energy.Glick says that connecting the Oahu and Maui grids is fundamentally different from the other projects. The cables from Molokai and Lanai have been described as extension cords that transport energy to Oahu. The Maui cable would actually link the two electric grids, allowing electricity to \u2014 if everything worked out right \u2014 be transferred back and forth seamlessly.This would be good for many reasons, he says. By connecting the individual island grids, both islands would be able to bring more renewable energy online. Currently, the grids can only handle a relatively small penetration of wind and solar energy before engineers become concerned that the energy will harm their power systems.\u201cThis helps eliminate or at least reduce the bottlenecks in a long-term way,\u201d said Glick.Linking the grids would also allow the utility to absorb wind energy that is being dumped because there is currently no way to absorb it. About 30 percent to 50 percent of the energy from Maui\u2019s three wind farms is being wasted, said Bob Kendall, a managing director for Navigant, an international energy consulting firm that has produced voluminous studies on Hawaii\u2019s renewable energy options.The connected grids would also allow the electric utility to reduce its spinning reserves, which consist of backup power that the utility keeps idling in the event of a major power outage, said Kendall. (He noted that such reserve energy results in \u201cmassive costs.\u201d) It could even allow Maui to retire its 53-megawatt oil-powered generator because it could rely on Oahu as a backup.Ultimately, connecting the grids would result in an estimated $1 billion in fuel savings, he said, allowing HECO to further retire old oil-powered generators.The cable\u2019s price tag is estimated at $700 million, which would be paid off by ratepayers over the course of its 30 to 50 year lifetime. Even if no new renewable energy sources are brought online, Kendall says, the cable would save ratepayers $10 million just from increased efficiency \u2014 and that\u2019s after subtracting the estimated cost of the cable.As Hawaii seeks to advance toward energy independence, satisfying Oahu's large appetite for electricity, where 75 percent of the state\u2019s population lives, has been one of the greatest obstacles.HECO and energy policymakers have long argued that Oahu doesn\u2019t have the renewable energy resources to serve its population, at least not in any affordable way, and that it must rely on energy from the neighbor islands.But recently, HECO announced long-term energy plans that conclude that it is possible for Oahu to meet the state's renewable energy goals without breaking the bank.This sparked skepticism in the state energy office where officials said that none of their energy analyses supported such a conclusion. (Glick said he has asked for HECO\u2019s analysis, but has yet to receive it.)But while developers might be able to place wind turbines and solar farms around Oahu, one of the biggest questions is whether they can do so at a price that makes sense.Navigant\u2019s analysis compared the cost of implanting 200 megawatts of wind energy \u2014 about 70 wind turbines \u2014 on Oahu versus Maui. A conservative estimate, according to Kendall, is that it would be $423 million cheaper on Maui. The savings come, in part, from stronger wind resources.Glick said that if the grids are connected, electricity rates on Oahu and Maui would be equalized, which would mean electric bill savings for Maui residents. The rates they pay have traditionally been higher than those on Oahu.But questions remain as to whether Maui residents will accept or perhaps even support the Maui-Oahu cable. Unlike on Molokai and Lanai, Glick said he hadn't heard of protests from Maui residents.\u201cIt\u2019s a different environment today and I\u2019m not going to dig back in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk forward very confidently, and hopefully we can resolve issues to make it a positive thing for everybody.\u201dBut Doug McLeod, Maui\u2019s energy commissioner, was less confident that the connected grids would go over well there.The county wants the cable, McLeod said, but he expects residents to argue that Oahu should do more to satisfy its own energy needs internally rather than rely on Maui or other islands to serve as a sort of \u201cenergy colony.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m one hundred percent sure that is going to be a live issue,\u201d he said.And Maui residents aren't particularly amenable to more wind farms for aesthetic reasons and due to the underlying sense, whether perceived or real, that current wind farms haven't brought the promised benefits to ratepayers, said McLeod.He said that there is more support for solar farms.But while Navigant's report found greater incentives to install wind energy on Maui than on Oahu, they are less obvious with solar.McLeod also raised concerns about the economic benefits of the cable and said he expected the county to deal with the wind curtailment problem way before any cable is online. There are other technologies such as battery storage or pumped hydro that could also reduce curtailment, he said.\u201cWe are really, really nervous about how you calculate the financial benefit of a cable,\u201d said McLeod. He added that changes in the industry between now and 2020, when the cable would start to have an impact, could be as important as what happens in the years after the cable becomes functional.In other words, given that Navigant\u2019s estimated savings rely on projected electricity costs, a lot could change in the energy world between now and the end of the decade.McLeod said that the state, along with energy developers, will need to find a convincing explanation about the cable's benefits for Maui residents because he thinks that simply arguing that the grid-link will bring down electricity rates on the island won't be sufficient.\u201cIt\u2019s an illusory promise,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made the same claim on Lanai that the cable will level out rates. After a couple of years, what we found was that Oahu rates had risen so much that the majority of the supposed economic benefit was gone. The same thing could apply between Oahu and Maui.\u201dAnd given that he believes that technical arguments in favor of the cable are \u201cincomprehensible to average people,\u201d McLeod said it remains to be seen which of the good arguments in favor of the cable might win over the residents of Maui.\u201cI can\u2019t finish the sentence so that the average person nods their head and says that makes sense,\u201d said McLeod.If he finds the answer, it could be empowering."}, {"title": "Adorable Lion Cubs Celebrate Halloween Early With Pumpkin Pouncing", "text": "Forget smashing pumpkins, lion cubs know it's way more fun to to give the festive gourds a good pouncing.Sango and Sabi gave guests an adorable show playing with the pumpkins at the Denver Zoo's Predator Ridge.

And unlike the other environmental laws that passed in the 1970s, TSCA is the only one never to be updated and authorized.The problem is we know a lot more about chemicals, their health effects and how they behave then we did back in the 1970s.Enter parent activismIn response, hundreds of people from all walks of life gathered at the Capitol this week to ask Congress to do something about this important issue. There has been movement to update our laws, but the bill before the Senate - the Chemical Safety Improvement Act -- as drafted, doesn't adequately protect public health from toxic chemicals.Over 80 Congressional offices heard our message -- we want reform of our federal laws on toxic chemicals to be meaningful and real. We want reform to protect pregnant women, children and vulnerable communities. It's really quite simple.What good is it if we pass a law that is as bad as the one already on the books?Jennifer Beals speaks upJennifer Beals, actor, mother and advocate, was a hit with the crowd.

I am tired of being a detective, hunting the Internet for clues as to what product is safe and what product is not safe and why.The chemical industry may have well-dressed lobbyists hitting the Hill daily, but when hundreds of parents come together to speak up about an issue as important as protecting our families from toxic chemicals, Congress listens.The movement and wave of activism that is coming from all corners of the country is a force to be reckoned with.

His name is Bob. He lurches into view mere moments into almost every heated discussion of population growth.Rational discourse ends as soon as the zombie shows up.Long before he joined the ranks of the undead, Bob was an affable early 19th century professor and Anglican clergyman, known as \"Pop\" to his students.\"Pop\" was short for \"Population,\" since Reverend Bob authored a famous and still hugely controversial essay on that very topic. His given name was Thomas Robert, though he preferred \"Bob.\" His last name, Malthus, may be derived from a type of tavern known as a \"malt house.\" That's fitting, because conversations featuring Zombie Bob are likely to drive one to drink:\"You're a Malthusian!\"\"Maybe so, but you're an ostrich! You're ignoring the facts! Besides, I'm really more of a neo-Malthusian.\"And on it goes, ad nauseam.Now that it's Halloween -- and there's no shortage of other zombies on the streets -- perhaps we could allow dear, decayed old Bob to finally rest in peace. Here's how:First, before arguing about what he wrote, perhaps folks could read some of it. I realize that's a big lift since \"An Essay on the Principle of Population,\" first published in 1798, runs some 125 pages. Malthus published the first edition anonymously. When it proved popular, he rewrote the essay. The rewritten version went through six editions, the final one published in 1826.Second, we might pause to consider that, before he became a zombie, Bob was no simpleton. Some of his notions have withstood the test of time. For example, as another Bob - Bob Engelman of Worldwatch Institute -- points out, having sex is easier and more fun than growing corn. In the absence of effective birth control, that could lead to a corn shortage.Malthus was never the cartoonish figure depicted by his opponents, and even some of his supporters. Nor was he an uncaring sort. He was keenly aware of human suffering. As he wrote: \"The rich, by unfair combinations, contribute frequently to prolong a season of distress among the poor.\"One might even say that Malthus really wasn't all that much of a \"Malthusian\" since that has come to connote pessimism. If anything, he was a forward-looking optimist: \"The main peculiarity which distinguishes man from other animals is the means of his support -- the power which he possesses of very greatly increasing these means.\"Malthus is considered a founder of the field of economics, and no less than Charles Darwin was inspired by some of Malthus's writings. So perhaps the gentle Anglican can be forgiven for not having considered the implications of climate change -- an issue little understood until more than a century after his death -- if not his departure.The most common rejoinder offered by the No Worries Crowd is that the production of food has kept up with population growth, a fact contrary to Malthus's postulations. But here's the rub: That's only happened because we now use massive quantities of fossil fuels to produce all of that food.Since the time of Malthus, human population has increased sevenfold. But fossil fuel emissions are nearly 10,000 times higher. If that's not the sort of geometric growth Malthus warned about, I don't know what is.People can learn from Malthus -- and from some of those who have taken serious issue with what he actually wrote. But I think it's time we banished the decayed, distorted figure of Zombie Bob from our earthly realm."}, {"title": "Teddy Bear The Porcupine Tells Us All About Eating A Pumpkin", "text": "Teddy Bear the talking porcupine is back with another video to tell us about munchin' on a pumpkin!We aren't quite sure what he's saying but judging by his general love for food, he's probably saying something good.

The EPA has set up listening sessions around the country to hear -- from you -- what it should do about our changing climate.In these sessions, the EPA is trying to \"solicit ideas and input from the public and stakeholders about the best Clean Air Act approaches to reducing carbon pollution from existing power plants.\"Why is this so important? Because it's one of the most significant ways our president can reduce our nation's carbon dioxide emissions.By issuing a Carbon Emissions Standard for Existing Power Plants, EPA will be able to regulate the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from power plants. Around 40 percent of our nation's carbon dioxide comes from power plants that are burning fossil fuels to make electricity. It's the largest individual source of carbon pollution, and so it's a crucial place to focus if we want to reduce the dangerous emissions that are warming our climate.Power plants are currently required to limit their emissions of lead, mercury, and other toxic pollutants. The Supreme Court has established that carbon dioxide is a pollutant: It endangers human health and the environment, and, as a result, the EPA can regulate its emissions. The agency is on track to issue a proposed standard for carbon emissions from existing power plants in June, 2014.EPA has already issued proposed standards for new power plants. But the new power plant standards will apply only to newly built plants. The carbon standards for existing power plants -- the ones slated to be rolled out next June -- will apply to all power plants currently in existence. They therefore will have a much greater impact on current, actual carbon dioxide emissions.Now EPA is trying to figure out how strong those regulations should be.That's where moms and dads come into the picture.These listening sessions will lay the groundwork for a strong, protective carbon pollution standard -- but only if we speak up. About why we care about climate change. About our children's health. About our children's future. About why the industry message -- that it's harmful to our nation to limit carbon emissions -- ignores our precious children, and discounts their future.Moms Clean Air Force is going to be a strong presence at these sessions.

Indeed, money is independence.But what is money?All money is reducible to one and the same currency: energy. That's what flows through us, what moves us, and what motivates us. Money energizes because money is energy. The American greenback is a symbolic leaf of life: It starts out as a banknote of photosynthesis and is metabolized time and again through the samsaric mill of metabolic reincarnations until it transmutes into a living leaf of informational and symbolic value that is redeemable for energy. Currency is literally a current -- a current of energy trade. As such, money is a fundamentally heterotrophic invention. Money is an exchange of borrowed calories by those who didn't produce them in the first place. Autotrophs, the energy generators, have no need for money. Plants, unlike animals, are fundamentally and inalienably democratic and energy-independent. Each blade of grass has more sovereignty than any human nation. A blade of grass depends on nothing for its metabolic needs except abundant sun, air, water, and minerals. Each blade of grass is a dominion unto itself. It needs not ask, beg, buy, or trade. It is sovereign.And so shall Homo solaris be. Reliant on the commons of sun, air, water, and minerals for physiological needs, Homo solaris will be beyond money and thus beyond the corruption of money and therefore fundamentally sovereign and inalienably free.In his book Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth, Richard Fortey reminisces about the photosynthetic Eden of Precambrian time: \"Cellularity had become a food chain, gobbling began, and voracity has never gone away. If there were a point in history at which Tennyson's famous phrase 'Nature, red in tooth and claw' could be said first to apply, this was it... The era of photosynthetic passivity and peaceful coexistence...had passed from the Earth, and the hierarchy of power has never subsequently been forgotten\" (1998, 92-93). He's absolutely right: Heterotrophy is fundamentally hierarchical. Human photosynthesis, through \"techno-organic evolution,\" wouldn't have to mean passivity, but it certainly can mean peaceful coexistence. Human photosynthesis, as I see it, would enable each individual through possession of an independent means of energy production. A civilization of metabolically independent individuals is a natural-born democracy.Adapted from Reinventing the Meal (Somov, New Harbinger, 2012)"}, {"title": "Tiny Plastic Beads Are Invading The Great Lakes. Here's What Scientists Are Doing To Stop It", "text": "Several months ago, scientists warned that tiny microbeads, a common ingredient in facial cleansers, were flowing into the Great Lakes,  with no way to remove the potentially harmful plastic. Now, a new study provides evidence of the microplastics in the world's largest surface freshwater source -- and gives scientists a fighting chance to get microbeads out of consumer products.\"Microplastic Pollution in the Surface Waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes,\" published this week in scientific journal Marine Pollution Bulletin by the 5 Gyres Institute with researchers from SUNY Fredonia, documents the existence of microbeads in the Great Lakes.\"We found high concentrations of micro-plastics, more than most ocean samples collected worldwide,\" said Marcus Eriksen, who has a doctorate in science education and was the lead author on the paper. Eriksen is the co-founder executive director of 5 Gyres, a nonprofit that studies aquatic plastic pollution.Scientist used a manta trawl (essentially, a net) to collect samples from 21 points in lakes Erie, Huron and Superior. All but one contained plastic. Much more plastic was found in Lake Erie, the most populated of the three lakes. Two of its eight samples, downstream from Erie, Pa., Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, contained 85 percent of all the microplastic particles collected in the entire study.   At one point, they found 466,000 particles per square kilometer, with an average of 43,000 particles per square kilometer. Most of these particles, which are used in bath products to scrub skin and are meant to wash down the drain, are less than one millimeter in size.AP Photo courtesy 5 Gyres.The microplastics they found \"were of similar size, shape, texture and composition to plastic microbeads found in many consumer products used as exfoliants, giving us circumstantial evidence that these products, designed to be washed down the drain, are not adequately being captured by sewage treatment,\u201d Eriksen said.Halyna Breslawec, who has a doctorate in medicinal chemistry and is chief scientist for the Personal Care Product Council trade association, said that while its member companies are committed to environmental responsibility, microplastics pose a relatively small threat.\u201cCompared with other environmental sources of plastics, microplastics (MPs) from cosmetics and personal care products comprise a relatively small percentage of total plastics by mass.\" Breslawec told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Evidence continues to show that concentration levels in terms of ecological effects are low.\u201dErikson agrees that their size is relatively small, but that is in part why they are cause for concern. In .1 gram of a facial cleanser, he found 6,000 microbeads. Three small tubes of the cream cleanser would contain about a million microbeads. Though many of the microplastics are captured by waste treatment plants, Eriksen said \"there are potentially millions of these microbeads just drifting across the Great Lakes.\"Photo courtesy 5 Gyres.And they may pose a danger to aquatic life. The microbeads, which are similar in size to fish eggs, can be swallowed by fish and stay in their systems for a long time. Eriksen explained that dangerous chemicals that aren't water soluble can attach to plastics, and they hypothesize that it may be possible for microbeads to be a carrier for pollutants that can be absorbed into fish tissues once swallowed.It also raises concerns about what happens further up in the food chain if fish absorb toxins. There's been little documentation on the effects of microplastics on ecosystems so far, but Eriksen said that was no reason to wait to act.\"This is the chance to employ the precautionary principle,\" Eriksen said. \"If we suspect harm, why wait?\"Rather than solely present their findings, 5 Gyres has let their research steer advocacy. They're pursuing legislation in Great Lakes states that would prevent the use of microbeads in consumer products.\"Products that are made to be thrown away using a material designed to last forever really have no place in the 21st century,\" he said.They aren't just waiting for slow-moving legislative bodies to act. In less than a year, several major companies have agreed to stop using microbeads in their products. Unilever (including Dove, Pond's and other brands) committed to phasing out microbeads globally by 2015. Johnson & Johnson (which includes Neutrogena and Aveeno) has begun to phase out microbeads and is not developing new products containing them. The Body Shop, L\u2019Oreal, Colgate-Palmolive and others have all agreed to phase out microbeads in the coming years, according to the 5 Gyres Institute.There are natural exfoliating alternatives, already used in some products, like sea salt or crushed apricot seeds.5 Gyres is also a partner in the \"Beat the Microbead\" campaign, a project of the Plastic Soup Foundation and Stichting De Noordzee of the Netherlands, which produced an app that lets consumers scan the barcode of a product to see whether it contains plastics.\"Thats the way I think science needs to go,\" Eriksen said. \"Science without solutions is only doing half its job. ... Scientists can't just say, 'here's the information' and give it to the world to make sense of it. Scientists, who know the information best, have to be the communicators.\""}, {"title": "Daylight Saving Time 2013 Ends November 3, So Prepare To Turn Back Your Clocks", "text": "Sunday is going to be a good day for sleeping in. Well, if you're in an area that observes daylight saving time anyway.Yes, the biannual changing of the clocks is upon us. Many in North America will gain an extra hour when daylight saving ends Nov. 3, and time falls back one hour, meaning you'll have an extra hour to do whatever you wish this weekend.The change should take place automatically for most with smartphones, laptops and tablets. (Make sure you have the \"set automatically\" feature enabled in your date and time settings.)But for those using analog watches and non-digital alarm clocks, the switch will take place at 2 a.m. Sunday. So expect your clock to be an hour ahead when you wake up in the morning. (Or you may want to consider preemptively turning the clock back by one hour before bed Sunday.)With the end of the daylight saving, which took effect this year on March 10, participating countries will return to standard time. By shifting the observed time forward in the spring and back in the fall, territories are able to maximize the hours of sunlight available during regular daytime hours.However, not everyone will receive an additional hour this week. Residents in Arizona and Hawaii, for example, do not take part in the time change. As Arizona's KNXV-TV notes, the choice not to observe daylight saving is linked to the weather.While daylight saving time has often been associated with saving energy, some recent studies suggest the practice does the opposite and may even result in increased use of electricity to provide lighting.Still, the U.S. standardized the practice with the 1966 Uniform Time Act and extended daylight saving time by one month in 2005.Benjamin Franklin is credited with proposing the time change more than 100 years before the process was introduced by George Vernon Hudson, a New Zealand entomologist, in 1895. The modern practice was not widely accepted until some time later.Daylight saving time is observed around the world in parts of South America, Africa and Australia, but countries in North America and Europe are the primary adopters. European nations have already gained an extra hour, setting their clocks back a week before the U.S. on Oct. 27."}, {"title": "Pet Snakes Are Constricting Our Public Safety", "text": "I read recently that one of my countrymen, a British citizen, was sentenced to five years in prison for smuggling snakes from Kenya. A double tragedy personally as Born Free has such a long and important history of trying to save Kenya's wildlife.The good news is that instead of receiving a simple fine -- the cost of doing business - and going free, prison was imposed. It's about time judicial systems globally got serious about wildlife crime, including the very dangerous trade in snakes, many of which are poisonous or in other ways deadly.The issues are profound. A 10-foot long rock python strangled and killed a 60-pound family dog in Miami-Dade County, Florida. This attack comes on the heels of the now-infamous report from a few weeks earlier, when a 15-foot long African rock python escaped its enclosure and suffocated two young Canadian boys in their sleep.In 2009, a two-year-old girl near Orlando, Florida was strangled to death by her family's 12-foot Burmese python. And, in 2012, a 70-year-old Virginia man was killed by his own pet poisonous snakes.Sadly, this is just a sampling of tragic incidents involving snake attacks. It should be glaringly obvious by now; snakes can be dangerous, and they make bad pets.The tragedy involving the Miami-Dade County dog was the 58th snake incident tracked by Born Free USA so far this year. In the time it has taken me to compose my thoughts for this article over the past few weeks, Born Free USA has tracked another dozen snake incidents around the U.S.. We maintain an exotic animal incidents database that has tracked 471 dangerous incidents involving snakes since 1995. In this time, at least 19 humans have died terrible-and preventable-deaths.Born Free USA has noted a steady increase in snake ownership, especially among deadly pythons and boa constrictors. Predictably, there has also been a sharp rise in incidents involving \"pet\" snakes escaping and endangering communities and the environment, and injuring or killing humans. The upward trajectory in snake-related incidents is jarring. In 2009, we tracked 20 incidents involving snakes; in 2010, we tracked 9; in 2011, the number of incidents had risen to 82; and, in 2012, we tracked a record 106 incidents.This year is on track to potentially be another record-breaker. In the summer of 2013 alone, deadly pet snakes were on the loose in Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Wisconsin after escaping from their owners.The statistics speak for themselves. When will the public listen?Our Born Free USA Executive Vice President, Adam Roberts, explains, \"Clearly, this is a national problem and we can only assume that the actual numbers, when factoring in unreported events, are much higher. We are seriously concerned about the epidemic of owning deadly snakes. Large snake ownership remains unregulated or poorly regulated across the country. While there are 40 states with some regulation pertaining to private ownership of snakes, some have fairly strict laws (Hawaii, Alaska, and California) while others are quite vague and lenient (Georgia and Idaho). And, in most states, the restrictions are only for venomous snakes.\" Roberts adds, \"Snakes are wild animals who cannot be trained and, at any time, can display their normal wild behavior, which may include a poisonous bite or strangulation.\"Not only do snakes harm humans and pets, but they also damage the ecosystem by threatening indigenous and endangered species, resulting in major economic losses and expenditures. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, millions of dollars have been spent to thwart the ecological impact of nonnative invasive snakes. Pet snakes tend to be introduced to the ecosystem when owners grow tired or frustrated with them and release them into the wild. This is a particularly acute problem in Florida, where snakes, who had most likely been pets, are destroying the local ecosystem and posing a threat to humans, to wildlife, and to pets.Compounding the problem is the lucrative nature of the exotic pet trade. Police officers discovered 850 snakes jammed into a man's Suffolk County, New York garage, awaiting sale to online buyers through his internet business, Snakeman's Exotics. The snakes were worth an estimated half-million dollars.It's a shame that people are willing to ignore the extreme risks of snake ownership, merely to make some money or to live with an exotic pet. And, despite the obvious safety and environmental concerns, legal restrictions have been inadequate-and hardly deterrent.Roberts declares, \"It is simply too easy in most states for unprepared individuals to purchase potentially dangerous snakes. They are being imported from Asia, Australia, Africa, and Central America; they are kept in inappropriate caging; they escape; they kill; and they pose a threat to the natural ecosystem. What will it take for legislators to put an end to this unjustifiable animal ownership?\"What will it take? Born Free USA will continue to push legislators to make the compassionate choice for snakes, for other pets and wildlife, for humans, and for the environment: to ban ownership of these wild animals who truly belong in the wild."}, {"title": "Let's Be \"Smart From the Start\" With Solar, Wind on Public Lands", "text": "America's Western public lands are home to some of the best hunting, fishing and wildlife habitat in the world. They're part of what define America's outdoor heritage and fuel our outdoor recreation economy, responsible for about 6.1 million jobs and $646 billion in spending yearly. These same lands, however, also provide some of the best wind and solar resources our county has to offer.Because of these resources, it makes sense that public lands play a leading role in President Obama's climate plan. Significant progress has already been made with permitting large-scale wind and solar projects. The steps the Department of the Interior has taken to preserve valuable fish and wildlife habitat as it plans for this increased renewable energy development should be commended. With public input, The Department of the Interior has identified low-conflict, potentially highly productive places for large-scale solar projects to be built. The department designated 19 solar-energy zones to avoid critical wildlife habitat, recreation areas and environmentally sensitive areas. The plan is a model for being \"smart from the start\" about renewable energy development on our public lands.Last week, the Bureau of Land Management held the first of what will likely be many competitive auctions for solar development in a solar-energy zone in southern Colorado. No bids were offered, highlighting the complex economics of solar development are complicated. BLM officials said five companies had previously expressed interest in the site. The agency expressed confidence in the blueprint for development approved by the Department of the Interior in 2012.However, the auction does the underscore the need for additional tools to ensure the success of responsible renewable energy development on our public lands.Key among them are bipartisan efforts under way in Congress to ensure that revenues collected from renewable energy developers are reinvested in local communities, conservation efforts and access for hunting and fishing. The practice of sharing revenue collected from energy development with affected counties, states and to offset environmental impacts is already in place for oil and gas production on public lands and waters. A similar approach could be adopted for wind and solar energy by passing the bi-partisan Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act (H.R. 596/S.279). This legislation is sponsored by Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Dean Heller, R-Nev.; and Reps Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., Joe Heck, R-Nev., Mike Thompson, D-Calif., and Jared Polis, D-Colo. The bills are a common-sense approach to make sure funding is available to offset unavoidable impacts to hunting and fishing and nearby communities.The Department of the Interior can also take steps to develop criteria for mitigating the unavoidable impacts of solar projects. This will add certainty and lay out clear expectations for development costs, while ensuring key hunting, fishing and wildlife habitat are protected and restored. Solar industry officials cited uncertainty about the ground rules as one possible explanation for the lack of bids in last week's auction. The department is expected to release draft rules on solar and wind leasing this winter, which will help provide more certainty for the industry as well as conservation, wildlife, and hunting and angling groups.The Department of the Interior has come a long way in a short period of time to build a better way of developing the power we need to make the country safer, more secure and transition toward a clean energy future. Through smart planning, we can avoid the mistakes of the past energy production, including poorly planned oil and gas development, and safeguard our prized public lands while guaranteeing our hunting, fishing and outdoor heritage for generations to come."}, {"title": "Protesters Slam Jerry Brown, Claim Climate Change Pact Is Undermined By Pro-Fracking Stance", "text": "California Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s signing of a climate deal with Oregon, Washington and British Columbia in San Francisco on Monday drew dozens of protesters, claiming that his support of fracking undermines the climate agreement\u2019s potential for progress.The climate deal calls for the region to align its efforts in the fight against climate change. Proposed agreements include expanding use of zero-emission vehicles, harmonizing greenhouse gas reduction targets, supporting research on combatting ocean acidification, deploying high-speed rails, accounting for costs of carbon pollution and adopting low-carbon fuel standards.But activists say the signing is meaningless as long as Brown supports some level of fracking, the process of injecting water and chemicals underground to break up rocks and free oil and natural gas.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the elephant in the room that Governor Brown is supposedly a climate change champion and trying to avert it, yet he\u2019s also a champion of fracking,\u201d Anna Ghosh of Food and Water Watch told The Huffington Post at the protest. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that fracking contributes to fossil fuel consumption, which contributes to climate change.\u201dWhile Brown signed California\u2019s first fracking regulations last month, many environmentalists insisted the bill did not go far enough and that he should ban fracking, a practice they say pollutes the water supply and produces excessive global warming pollution.\u201cIt is starkly hypocritical for Governor Brown to be inking climate agreements while greenlighting massively expanded fracking in California, which we know is a massive threat to our climate,\u201d Zack Malitz of CREDO told HuffPost.The fracking regulations allow oil companies to obtain fracking permits but requires them to alert neighbors, test groundwater, publicly disclose the chemicals used and study the fracking\u2019s environmental impact. Brown favors some fracking of the state\u2019s Monterey Shale deposit, where an estimated 15 billion barrels of oil are recoverable. Protestors argued that this goes against many environmental organizations\u2019 warnings.\u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency have repeatedly said you need to keep about two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves underground if we want to stand a chance of averting the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d Rose Braz of the Center for Biological Diversity told HuffPost. \u201cIf he wants his legacy to really be one of a leader on climate change, then fracking California for all this dirty oil is precisely the wrong way to go.\u201dBrown said the bill required some clarifying amendments and that he will work with its author to implement them."}, {"title": "Vampire Slaying and More: NRDC's Halloween Energy Survival Guide", "text": "Along with being a fun holiday for tricks and treats, Halloween is an opportune time to shine a ghostly light on the evil energy vampires lurking in our homes. By these we mean those ghoulish fangs -- also known as plugs in the wall -- sucking frightening amounts of electricity all night (and day) long, even when our bloodthirsty electronics and appliances are turned off or doing nothing useful.The chilling truth is that as much as one-tenth of the electricity devoured in our homes vanishes as \"standby power\" -- electricity feeding our perpetually plugged-in electronics and appliances even when they're idle for long periods of time, like in the dead of night.But you can drive a stake through these energy demons by following this Halloween Energy Survival Guide. Not only will it help save money on your utility bill year-round, it also can avoid the nightmare of millions of tons of dangerous pollution from power plants generating extra electricity to satisfy our energy-gobbling appliances and electronics when they are not being used. Here's what you need to know to protect yourself:Your cell phone charger is not the boogeyman -- Although these chargers once consumed 2 to 4 watts of power if plugged in with no cell phone attached, today's chargers only use 0.1 watt or less in this ghostly condition. Your microwave oven, on the other hand, draws as much standby power as 35 new cell phone chargers do annually. While unplugging your charger will save some energy, there are far more menacing energy fiends haunting your home.Save up to $100 a year by making sure your game console \"sleeps\" when you do -- Video game consoles like the PS3 and Xbox 360 only use 1 watt of power in standby mode waiting to be turned back on. But if your child or roommate forgets to turn off the console after playing a game or watching a movie, it can -- if left on indefinitely -- gorge on 60 to 100-plus watts of power, wasting $50 to $100 worth of electricity each year. To slay the vampire: Go into the console's user menu and enable the Auto Power Down feature, allowing it to automatically power down after extended periods of inactivity.Your cable or satellite set top box uses near full power even when \"off\" -- NRDC took measurements of set top boxes provided to customers by companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Direct TV, and Verizon, and found the devices gobbled around $3 billion worth of electricity in 2010 -- and a giant two-thirds of it in standby mode. Turning off the box merely dims the clock in some cases, or at best, stops the DVR's hard drive from spinning when not recording a show. To slay the vampire: a) ask your cable or satellite company for a set top box that meets at least ENERGY STAR Version 3.0 and, if available, b) request a whole home DVR for your main TV and a thin client, instead of a regular box or DVR for your second and third TVs. This combination will allow you to watch recorded shows on any TV in the home and result in lower overall household energy use, and c) unplug the set top box on seldom-used TVs (possibly in your guest room or vacation home). Fortunately, the industry is working really hard to make these boxes more efficient, putting us on track to save roughly a billion dollars in electricity costs via better-designed boxes that have recently entered the market.Buy a green TV and choose the right settings -- Today's new flat-panel televisions use far less energy than the models from just a few years ago. Buy a TV with the ENERGY STAR label or better yet, one that meets EPEAT's criteria ensuring it's not only energy efficient, but also has very low levels of toxics, is designed to be easily recycled, etc. To slay the vampire: During set-up of your new TV, select the home or standard setting, which avoids the overly bright \"vivid\" or \"retail\" settings that burn an extra 15 to 20 percent of power. And don't choose \"quick start\" unless you really need it. Most TVs today use enough power in standby (0.5 watts or so) to recognize your remote control's signal when you want to turn it on. With \"quick start\" the TV might turn on slightly faster but is also likely to consume substantially more standby power during the 15 to 20 hours it's turned off every day.Don't Watch Dracula (or other movies) from your game console -- Many of the newer TVs are Internet-ready and allow you to stream a movie from Netflix without another device. The next best thing is to access movies via a small box, such as Roku or Apple TV that use 5 or fewer watts to stream. To slay the vampire: Never use your game console to stream movies because it uses 10 to 20 times more energy.  Ensure your computer sleeps when you're not there -- There's no need for your computer to be fully awake if you're not using it. It can reawaken in less than five seconds when you shake the mouse button or lift the laptop's lid. To slay the vampire: EPA recommends adjusting control panel settings for the monitor/screen to turn off after 15 minutes and the computer to go to sleep after 30. You can adjust these settings to meet your needs but the key is for the computer to turn off when not in use. A typical desktop computer and monitor left on 24/7 can waste $40 a year in electricity compared to the same desktop set to go into sleep mode when unused. Meanwhile, running a continuous slide show or screen saver of your family or pet wastes money because it prevents the computer from going to sleep, making it work harder than necessary when no one's there.The new vampires are data modems and routers -- Almost every home with high-speed internet service has a modem to transmit data and a router to move it around to your laptops and tablets. A recent NRDC study found these devices consume roughly $1 billion of electricity annually -- and drink almost the same amount of energy when receiving email as when skulking in the dark at 3 a.m. To slay the vampire: Look for models with the ENERGY STAR label as new, more efficient devices with better power management are starting to hit the shelves.Settings matter everywhere -- Even if you buy the most efficient air conditioner, heater, or water heater on the market, your energy savings are highly dependent upon the settings you select. To slay the vampire: Use a programmable thermostat to ensure your home is not wasting energy keeping cool in the summer or warm in the winter when no one's there. Set the temperatures on your gas or electric water heater only as high as you need it. Otherwise it works harder than necessary to make sure hot water is always ready for you. And if the water from the tap almost burns your hand, the water heater setting is too high and you're probably throwing away a few $20 bills down the drain every year.In other words, you don't need garlic and wooden stakes to ward off the terrifying vampire energy predators -- you can simply \"off\" many of them with the right buttons and settings.Cross-posted from NRDC's Switchboard blog."}, {"title": "Smithville, Texas Oil Spill: Koch Pipeline Leaks Crude Southeast Of Austin", "text": "A Koch Pipeline Co.-owned pipeline spilled around 400 barrels, or about 17,000 gallons, of crude oil in Central Texas this week, KVUE reported.A Texas Railroad Commission representative told the station that the spill likely came from a leak in an eight-inch diameter pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in Corpus Christi.The spill, which occurred about 40 miles southeast of Austin near Smithville, has reportedly been contained.

What makes the IPCC unique is that it is not the voice of a single scientist, or even that of a group. It represents a combined view of in this case 209 lead authors and a further 600 contributing authors. That is 809 scientists from all around the world, calmly setting out the data as they observe it. They observe that since the 1950s, many of the changes to our climate are unprecedented over the previous decades and in some cases millennia. They observe that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. They observe that each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983-2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years. Just after the report came out many business leaders urged immediate action from governments, businesses and society to reduce carbon emissions and increase resilience. They were right to do so.Climate change is sometimes misunderstood as being about changes in the weather. In reality it is about changes in our very way of life. Climatic shifts on the scale suggested by our current emissions trajectory could wreak havoc with the global agricultural system. 2 degrees of average warming could still mean several times that in the world's temperate regions, where much of the world's food is grown. Changing patterns of rainfall could increase the volatility of global crop yields as more countries experience droughts and floods that can wipe out whole harvests in the blink of an eye. All this during a period in which we expect the world to welcome an additional 2 billion people. The arithmetic doesn't add up. The gains in prosperity that many in the world have enjoyed over the past century of growth and industrialization could be severely curtailed if we do not change path urgently towards a more sustainable future. That is to say nothing of the more devastating effects of rising sea levels on the millions of people who live in low lying coastal regions and the prospect of hundreds of millions of environmental refugees that may be created if we do not act now.Governments' ambitions to limit warming to 2\u00b0C now appear increasingly more difficult: in 2012 PWC estimated that the required improvement in global carbon intensity to meet a 2\u00b0C warming target had risen to 5.1% a year from now to 2050 - a rate of decarbonization not achieved since World War Two. But every year of delay will increase emissions, lock the economy into a high carbon future and make future emissions reductions more costly. The world must therefore act in a swift and coordinated way to avoid the more pessimistic scenarios of 4\u00b0C or even 6 \u00b0C average warming above pre industrial levels.But faced with all this we have no choice but to be optimistic. It is often when most challenged that the human species can surprise us most. As we head towards the UN climate negotiations (UNFCCC COP19) that kick off on 11 November in Warsaw we have to focus on three things; Understating what is possible, showing what is possible and doing what is possible.Understanding what is possibleUnderstanding what is possible is simple. We already have a global process for world leaders to agree an international framework for addressing climate change. We have excellent leadership being shown by many nations around the world in their own domestic policy frameworks and their support for international action. Just in the last month I participated in the Global Green Growth Forum in Copenhagen, with prime ministers and cabinet secretaries from countries as diverse as Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Mexico and Indonesia working together, and with others to advance a greener path to growth. Just a week later, the launch of the European Green Growth ministerial summit in Brussels setting a clear direction for the European Union. We must be mindful of the fact that the reality of positive action is changing much faster now than ever before in response to the challenges we face. Sometimes it feels as though the record of media rhetoric is stuck in a defeatist loop, while outside the sun is rising on a new dawn of a low carbon, energy efficient world as more and more countries and companies wake up to the new economic reality that is green and inclusive growth. The reality is that we have a clear road map from the UN meeting in Warsaw to future meetings in Lima and then Paris in 2015 where the global deal will be signed. The reality is that growing coalitions of progressive and responsible businesses, youth and civil society movements are calling for action and the reality is that our political leaders are beginning to respond. Our political leaders have great responsibilities, but as with many situations in life, people often rise or fall to meet your expectations. Our responsibility as citizens, is to expect our leaders to lead, and to give them enough support so that they may do so.Showing what is possibleShowing what is possible is a particular responsibility for all of us. Leading countries and leading companies can do something magical. They can create the future. They can create it not everywhere but in pockets, they can set the ball rolling towards a better future. In doing so they can show to others in their industries, or their peer groups of countries what it is possible to achieve by thinking differently about the situation. They can inspire changes much greater than they could make alone, and they can act as catalysts for a wider movement of people that want to change direction but can't always see how to do it.About a decade ago Greenpeace came to Unilever and a number of other companies to point out that our ice cream cabinets used HFC refrigerants. HFCs are a potent greenhouse gas, in some cases with a global warming potential several thousand time that of CO2. They had developed an alternative refrigerant, a natural refrigerant, and asked us whether we would consider using that instead. It wasn't commercially available, it wasn't something we had considered, but in that simple action, Greenpeace succeeded in showing us all what was possible. Fast forward to today and Refrigerants, Naturally! the coalition formed through that process has transformed the market for ice cream freezers and soft drink fridges. Unilever has over a million natural refrigerant powered units in the market place, others have similar numbers, and the issue has been taken up by the Global Consumer Goods Forum - the global association for retailers and consumer goods companies, with work underway to transition the whole global retail and consumer industry to HFC free refrigeration solutions.Policy makers also need to be able to see what is possible, that's why the recent project launched by former president of Mexico, President Felipe Calderon is so important. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, commissioned by the governments of Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Korea, Norway, Sweden and the UK, and launched in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York in September, aims to provide a road map for countries seeking to navigate a pathway to a more sustainable future, recognizing the complexity of the challenge and the need to understand the economic case for action as well as the increasingly obvious moral one. With greater research into the trade offs facing governments in how they manage the relationship between tackling climate change and running their economies the project will again show what is possible in a way that should encourage leaders to take their own steps towards a brighter, more resilient and sustainable future.Doing what is possibleOf course ultimately this is all about action, and that's why wherever we are, whoever we are it is doing what is possible that counts the most. At Unilever we've been trying to do what's possible focusing on the really big areas where we think we can have an impact.For us the business case for action now is clear. Nearly every month, Unilever is exposed to another natural disaster, from floods in Greece and Turkey to droughts in the Midwest or Hurricane Sandy. The cost to our business can be over \u20ac300 million a year. AT Kearny and WRI report even 5 years ago estimated a reduction of 19 to 47 percent in 2018 in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for FMCG companies that do not develop strategies to mitigate the risks posed by environmental pressures. This fact alone should move climate chance higher up the scale of investors as well.Taking proactive action on climate change is essential to ensuring that Unilever remains a viable business in the future. We will also reap the benefits in innovation, new product development and cost efficiencies. As part of Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan, we have set a target to halve the greenhouse gas impact of our products across their lifecycle by 2020. We are making progress towards this commitment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport and manufacturing and using more renewable energy in our own operations. Since 2008 we have reduced our environmental footprint while avoiding cumulative supply chain costs of over Euro 350 million.By 2020 CO2 emissions from energy from our factories will be at or below 2008 levels despite significantly higher production volumes. This represents a reduction of around 40% per tonne of production. We will more than double our use of renewable energy to 40% of our total energy requirement by 2020. We recognize that this is only a first step towards a long-term goal of 100% renewable energy. All this is possible now, and we are doing it. With a little more help and encouragement, we believe others could too.However, our biggest greenhouse gas impact is associated with the use of our products - for example when energy is used to heat water for showering and laundry. Tackling this will require a wider transformation to a low carbon economy. This will require courageous government policies, effective carbon pricing and the wide-scale decarbonizing of energy grids. The conversations at the Global Green Growth Forum in Denmark and elsewhere make it clear that we increasingly know how to do this, we just need to turn up the heat to make it happen at an accelerated pace.But we have one other significant impact and one other significant opportunity where we have prioritized doing everything that is possible, and that is in the fight against illegal deforestation.Deforestation accounts for around 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Half of that deforestation is linked to just four commodity chains - palm oil, paper & pulp, soy and beef and a very small number of big industry players control over 50% of those commodities. While that might sound complex, it means in reality that a small group of committed companies can work together to drive change not just in their own supply chains but through the market as a whole. This is what Jason Clay of the WWF calls \"Market Transformation\". Unilever has already set targets for sourcing 100% of our agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020. In palm oil we are already doing what is possible, buying sustainable palm oil through a certificated route, and we will go further to full traceability by 2020. As more companies come on board this movement will grow. And here we come back to the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) where at the Cancun Climate Summit in 2010 we announced that CGF members were committing to eliminate illegal deforestation from their supply chains by 2020, sending an incredible signal to the marketplace that the rules of the game were changing.This action has inspired widespread support from NGOs and Governments, to the point that a new movement - the Tropical Forest Alliance has come together to ensure public private and voluntary sectors can combine forces in new models to support forested countries looking for ways to ensure the sustainability of their agricultural and forest systems.We need to see more initiatives like this, natural groups coming together led by business but involving all stakeholders to collaborate on the issues where they have disproportional influence over the sustainability performance of a value chain, an industry or a type of emissions. By creating focal points for action we can create platforms in which we can engage policy makers to help them see how by creating the right enabling frameworks these initiatives can be scaled even faster.COP19 in Warsaw provides the opportunity to transform words into real action and commitments by all involved, especially raising the critical role for business to play. To me it is clear that to cost of not taking action exceeds the cost of action, so there is no time to waste.Again, the challenge will be for leaders in public and private sectors to demonstrate how they are part of the solution, not the problem, We need to remind ourselves that as the challenges become clearer so do the opportunities and that as the coalitions form and so the commitment to doing what is possible grows. In that way what was once seen as impossible comes quickly within our grasp.These are important weeks for the politicians and negotiators that will prepare for the climate talks, but these are also important weeks for all of us. Our individual and collective leadership can and must act as a galvanizing force to all those who travel to Poland to agree a brighter future for us all."}, {"title": "Some Voters Taking On Fracking Nov. 5, But Is It A Trend?", "text": "Regulating hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d is often the domain of individual states, but on election day on Nov. 5, voters in cities in Colorado and Ohio will determine whether cities in their states should be able to regulate oil and gas development themselves.Read more on Climate Central"}, {"title": "Court Rejects Drakes Bay Oyster Company's Privatization Efforts, Sides With Americans' Wilderness", "text": "Last month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Interior Department's decision to protect Drakes Estero in Point Reyes National Seashore as the West Coast's first marine wilderness. The ruling supports the Interior Department's efforts to protect the sensitive marine habitat from the Drakes Bay Oyster Company's ongoing operations that damage the natural environment, pollute National Seashore beaches with plastic debris, and negatively impact wildlife such as birds and harbor seals. Importantly, taxpayers purchased and planned for the protection of the property decades ago, and the company's lease on the land expired in November 2012.Drakes Bay's campaign to privatize our national parks raises questions about who supports and funds it, and who ultimately benefits. In January, California Common Cause began researching connections between Drakes Bay and the Koch Brothers, the Kansas-based industrialists who finance pro-business causes, including nationwide efforts to privatize public park lands.The company has partnered with ultra-conservative organizations and politicians, such as the Koch-funded Pacific Legal Foundation and U.S. Senator David Vitter (R-LA), author of legislation which would expedite permitting for the Keystone XL pipeline, open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for gas and oil development, and allow offshore drilling along the California coast and the rest of the country. Tucked at the very end of the 51-page energy bill is a provision which would strip marine wilderness protections and provide the oyster company with a new operating permit.Campaign finance disclosure records also show that company owners contributed to the campaigns of former Congressman Richard Pombo (R-CA), who sought to sell off national parks to the highest bidder.The company's lawsuit and arguments to the Appeals Court were handled by Cause of Action, a pro-public land development firm with strong links to the Koch Brothers. Though Cause of Action has not disclosed its financial backers, PR Watch reported that the Koch-funded Franklin Center recently provided Cause of Action a gift of nearly $1 million. (Note: After a PBS NewsHour report publicized the Drakes Bay's efforts to privatize national park wilderness with help from ultra-conservative allies in Congress, the Company's \"sustainable business\" cover was blown and it let Cause of Action go).The appeals court handily rejected the company's arguments challenging the Interior Secretary's decision to let the company's permit expire. \"In letting the permit lapse, the Secretary emphasized the importance of the long-term environmental impact of the decision on Drakes Estero, which is located in an area designated as potential wilderness,\" the court said. \"He also underscored that, when Drakes Bay purchased the property in 2005, it did so with eyes wide open to the fact that the permit acquired from its predecessor owner was set to expire just seven years later, in 2012.\"The court also put to rest the company's attacks on peer-reviewed scientific research that concluded Drakes Bay's ongoing operations were harming the environment. \"Drakes Bay puts considerable stock in its claims that the final EIS [environmental impact statement] was based on flawed science... Drakes Bay is not likely to succeed in showing that the final EIS was inadequate,\" the court said.In response to the ruling, former chief scientist at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Geographic Explorer in Residence Dr. Sylvia Earle stated, \"If the oysters, seals, birds, fish and tomorrow's children could speak, they would be cheering the wisdom of upholding the law, honoring the long-awaited removal of a commercial operation from the midst of a national and global treasure, Drakes Estero. Wilderness areas not only provide increasingly rare safe havens and sources of restoration for wildlife, they do the same for humankind.\"Despite repeated setbacks in court, the company's owners are continuing their fight to overturn the decision.\"Two courts have now seen through its attempt to set a precedent for exploiting public lands under the guise of local sustainable food,\" said Gordon Bennett, president of Save Our Seashore and former president of Westbrae Natural Foods, an early leader in the local organic food movement. \"Drakes Bay has cost taxpayers millions, yet it files more delaying lawsuits, raking in more cash and spreading more [invasive species] every week it stays open.Ultimately, wilderness will prevail, but the question is how much damage will be done in the meantime.\"California Common Cause believes our national parks and publicly owned lands are for the protection and enjoyment of all Americans, not for industry exploit, and we will continue to publicize this precedent-setting land-grab effort."}, {"title": "These Countries Face The Biggest Threats From Climate Change", "text": "The expected costs of climate change are painting a grimmer and grimmer picture of the future for people around the world.In its sixth annual Climate Change Vulnerability Index, risk consultancy firm Maplecroft revealed the countries most likely to suffer from the effects of warming climates by 2025.SCROLL FOR MAPTo develop its analysis, researchers evaluated 193 countries on three factors: the capacity of nations to combat the effects of climate change, exposure to extreme weather events and sensitivity of populations to this exposure in areas such as health and agricultural dependence. Maplecroft then assigned a risk level of \"extreme,\" \"high,\" \"medium\" or \"low,\" along with a numeric ranking to each country.According to the report provided to The Huffington Post, Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone have the most \"extreme\" risk rating. Of cities around the world, Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) and the Indian metropolis of Mumbai are the most at risk of being impacted by climate change.Despite its air pollution problems, China is not considered to be one of the nations at extreme risk. However, researchers did assign a risk rating of \"high\" to the Asian country, ranking it at 61 among the nearly 200 countries.On the opposite end of the index, the northern European nations of Ireland, Norway and Iceland rounded out the bottom of the list. Their low-risk rankings may have something to do with the \"ambitious\" energy and climate goals proposed by the environmental ministers of countries in the region.Though a report released earlier this year warned that American coastlines will likely get hit the hardest compared to other parts of the country, Maplecroft's index indicated that the U.S. as a whole actually has a relatively low risk. The U.S. ranked 158 among the 193 countries evaluated in Maplecroft's study.Last month, a United Nations-backed commission announced plans to launch a yearlong study investigating the economic benefits of taking action against climate change. The results will be released in September 2014, ahead of an international conference on climate change."}, {"title": "Kansas Highway Construction May Unearth Human Remains", "text": "In a recent New Yorker story called  \"Rush,\" a South Indian man says of his region's growing East Coast Road, \"Civilization only kills. I was much happier before we became civilized.\" His wife, similarly devastated by their teenage son's death in an automobile collision but recalling nights in a thatched hut surrounded by howling jackals, has a more nuanced take -- the highway should be safer, its drivers better trained.I'll be the last to romanticize the rustic and the first to appreciate a paved road. Highway 54 in southern Kansas, visible on the flat horizon from my upstairs farmhouse bedroom, eased a portion of the hour-long bus ride to and from my crucial public education. (In a handful of years, I experienced three school-bus flips and crashes on muddy, snow-packed or deer-frequented dirt roads.) After school I often drove one of our Honda \"three-wheelers\" first to the cattle pasture with feed buckets and then miles away to the closest county bridge over 54; I'd park the ATV, climb onto the concrete safety barrier and dangle my legs. When eighteen-wheelers zoomed toward me at 80 miles per hour, I'd pump an arm in the air and clutch the railing as they whooshed beneath my feet, their friendly honks echoing from beneath the bridge, my hair lifting toward the sky on swift gusts. It was a rush, as was the day I drove that same highway toward the University of Kansas in Lawrence, the hilly, treed town I now call home in the northeast corner of the state.There, in coming weeks, construction of the South Lawrence Trafficway -- six miles of broad highway meant to circumvent the college town -- is set to violate a broad swath of the Wakarusa Wetlands, 640 acres of hydric soil rich with biodiversity and cultural significance. Following decades of legal battles, the $150-million project finally would join existing stretches of Kansas Highway 10 to east and west of Lawrence. The southern loop would provide a handy bypass for semi-truck drivers and other commuters between Kansas City and Topeka (most efficiently linked at present by more northern points along Interstate 70). Environmentalists, biologists, indigenous tribes and others have been fighting for an alternate route since the 1980s; some of them occupied the area, recently sliced by a wide, mowed path marked for digging, Oct. 25 to 27.As Akash Kapur's New Yorker story demonstrates, progress is in the eye of the beholder. In many American cities, strategically charted 20th-Century highways represented \"urban renewal\" for white-collar commuters but meant, in James Baldwin's words, \"Negro removal\" for established black neighborhoods suddenly isolated from goods and services. To small towns, highways have been what railroads were during the 19th Century: economic life or death. (Tift Merritt describes the latter conundrum in a song perhaps inspired by Bynum, N.C., the former cotton-mill town where she got her start: \"They laid a highway a few years back/ Next town over by the railroad track/ Some nights, I'm glad it passed us by/ Some nights, I sit and watch my hometown die.\")The South Lawrence Trafficway means destruction not for neighborhoods or industries but for one of three sensitive wetland ecosystems in Kansas. Points on quantitative ecological losses and conservation merits are best left to scientists and groups such as the Sierra Club, which called the would-be highway one of the 50 most environmentally offensive projects in the country. But many Kansans have become experiential experts on the Wakarusa Wetlands area -- by leaving our computers and cars and entering it.We've witnessed its snakes, herons and turtles, touched its grasses in their tall autumn season and worn its spring mud on our feet. We've watched its flowers open toward the sun, its foxes and owls move in and out of sight with the moon. We are qualified to speak of its value and its life forms, who suffer greater dearth of habitat than do we of asphalt thoroughfare. Where will they go? It's a question imperialists and capitalists historically ask as afterthought and answer in whatever manner suits their purposes -- as indigenous tribes, African Americans, agricultural communities, the inner-city poor and others know all too well.The threatened wetlands border Haskell Indian Nations University, a four-year institution that opened under very different purposes in 1884 as the United States Indian Industrial Training School, a federal outpost for cultural genocide. The swampy area at the southern edge of the existing Haskell campus is held in memory and ceremony as a place to which terrorized children escaped to speak forbidden tongues, practice forbidden customs, remember themselves, find family members. Haskell students reportedly died from disease, abuse or suicide; a small campus cemetery contains more than a hundred of their bodies, but many were thrown, tribal elders say, into the wetlands.State consultants, after reviewing such reports by trafficway objectors, said insufficient evidence existed for halting the project; in 2012, a federal appeals courts made way for construction to begin. Officials have promised the highway won't dig into deep soil and that tribal representatives may attend excavations. If construction workers hit human remnants, officials have said, they will stop, notify police, call the state archaeologist. As for environmental considerations, about $23 million of total funds have been earmarked for tending surrounding areas and constructing new wetlands and an education center. (Since 1968, nearby Baker University has owned most of the wetlands area and used it for field research and education programs, while much smaller sections belong to Haskell, the University of Kansas and the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism.)No habitat goes unchanged, and our species is a flicker in infinite transitions of place. But we choose what role we play in that unfolding, and our choices reveal what we value, what our highways mean to us. An improved life? For whom? In the case of the South Lawrence Trafficway, many commuters may enjoy an even faster transit. Wealthy developers and corporations will garner much of the projected $3.7 billion in commercial impact. An ecosystem will suffer, increasingly so as the highway gives rise to surrounding development. And, should construction machinery strike human remains, children's bones will be disturbed by civilization for the second time."}, {"title": "Treasury Department to Stop Supporting U.S. Funding for Overseas Coal Projects", "text": "The Treasury Department has released revised \u201ccoal guidelines\u201d on how they will vote on coal projects brought to them by the development banks. A number of controversial coal projects have been approved by these banks in recent history, including some of the world\u2019s largest coal plants. These guidelines respond to the call by President Obama in the U.S. Climate Action Plan to stop using U.S. funding for overseas coal projects. These guidelines mean that the U.S. will have to vote no on using U.S. funding for coal projects that lead to more climate change. With clean energy booming around the world these banks should be focused on how to build more wind, solar, and energy efficiency -- not more coal projects.In June President Obama directed the U.S. government to stop using public financing for new coal plants overseas that don\u2019t capture their carbon. And he committed to work with other countries to implement similar provisions. Soon after this announcement the World Bank Group committed to funding coal projects only in \u201crare circumstances\u201d and the Nordic countries agreed to join the U.S. in ending overseas coal financing. These guidelines -- Guidance for U.S. Positions on MDBs Engaging with Developing Countries on Coal-Fired Power Generation -- are a next step in implementing this commitment to stop using scarce U.S. funding to support coal projects that are driving climate change.The Treasury Department represents the U.S. at the World Bank Group (WBG), Asian Development Bank (ADB), African Development Bank (AfDB), and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). So these revised guidelines would shape how the U.S. -- the largest shareholder at these institutions -- would vote on any coal project proposed by these development banks. Over the past 5 years these banks have invested almost $13 billion in coal projects that are driving climate change (see figure) so this is an important signal.I\u2019ll add more details tomorrow as I sort through the specifics, but here are quick reactions. The guidelines:Overall, this should send a clear signal that the time of using U.S. funding for overseas coal projects is at an end. By focusing these banks away from damaging coal projects it will free them to focus all their time and resources on deploying more renewable energy and energy efficiency. Sadly this hasn\u2019t been their storied history so hopefully this will mark the moment where they double-down on clean energy investments.------------* NRDC has classified projects in the Oil Change International Shift the Subsidies database according to project type (e.g., coal power plant, coal mine, etc).

Through iSeahorse, we can develop a more comprehensive picture of seahorse populations around the world, one seahorse sighting at a time. This big-picture approach will inform new scientific research and practical conservation measures that benefit seahorses and the ocean environments they inhabit.What is iSeahorse?iSeahorse allows anyone, anywhere in the world to contribute to seahorse science and conservation with just a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a smartphone. iSeahorse harnesses the power of citizen scientists -- divers, photographers, researchers, conservation groups and other wildlife enthusiasts around the world -- to improve our understanding of these elusive and threatened animals. This grassroots, crowdsourced program can have potentially large effects on policy and management. The platform offers a dual strategy for advancing seahorse conservation. The most accessible input to iSeahorse involves entering your seahorse sightings with a few quick keystrokes, where you become part of the iSeahorse community tracking and identifying seahorses. The second, more in-depth way to participate is by inputting survey data using standardized methods that can be downloaded from an online toolkit (functionality will be added soon). Whichever way you choose, iSeahorse contributors will receive feedback on their data from seahorse conservation experts and will learn how they play a vital role in advancing targeted ecological studies and informing large-scale sustainable management initiatives.What's the Impact?The iSeahorse platform serves as a bridge between the scientific community and general public, allowing everyone to contribute to seahorse conservation in a meaningful way. iSeahorse users will help scientists establish long-term monitoring sites, as well as record trends of seahorse populations around the world. We also hope that by creating an easily accessible, high-impact tool, the use of iSeahorse will inspire citizen science initiatives for other marine species.The program is quick and easy to use -- and it's already having impacts. In Southeast Asia, Dr. Tse-Lynn Loh, a Shedd Aquarium and Project Seahorse postdoctoral researcher, is conducting iSeahorse workshops and acting with government agencies and communities to establish long-term field research sites for the region's seahorse conservation community using in part data from iSeahorse.

The arrests capped an escalating wave of actions that affected more than fifteen PNC branches on the final day of PowerShift 2013, which included thousands of young climate activists from across the country.Billed as \"the biggest bank branch action in history,\" Earth Quaker Action Team (EQAT pronounced \"equate\") began the morning with \"Silent Occupations\" at ten PNC branches around the city, then disrupted the bank's lunchtime business at several downtown branches before the \"Tell the Truth\" action where the seven who committed civil disobedience outside of a locked bank ranged in age from 21 to seventy-five. The day marked another step in EQAT's escalating campaign to get PNC to stop financing mountaintop removal coal mining, while modeling rapid-fire escalation for youth at PowerShift.EQAT was founded on a belief that to win a just and sustainable economy will require smart strategy. That is why we chose PNC as our target to begin with. PNC is not only one of the largest funders of mountaintop removal coal mining (and fracking), it is also a Pennsylvania-based bank with Quaker roots, still the bank of several Quaker institutions. As a small group founded by Philadelphia Quakers, we saw a strategic opportunity to threaten the green image PNC has tried to promote.Believing that an escalating campaign helps a group build both credibility and muscle, EQAT members did not begin by chaining ourselves to the bank doors. We began with a letter to the bank, followed by a meeting with PNC's regional head to discuss our demand that they stop funding mountaintop removal coal mining. We were cordial while delivering a clear if-then threat. If PNC did not clean up its investments, we would make sure the public knew about it.We have kept our promise. In the three-plus years since then, we have gradually increased pressure on the bank, moving from low-risk actions -- like flyering and singing outside the PNC-sponsored Philadelphia Flower Show in 2010 -- to bolder actions like having several people risk arrest by setting up a \"flower crime scene\" inside the Flower Show a year later. In various PNC lobbies, we've sung Christmas carols with lyrics about PNC's policies, built a small mountain of dirt, put them on mock trial and built windmills -- all actions that were creative, fun and demonstrated graphically what we cared about.While our core members grew in courage and skill, we also wanted to expand our core geographically. The Green Walk for Jobs and Justice in the spring of 2012 pushed us to find new allies as we walked 200 miles across Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh, where we conducted a civil disobedience training on the sidewalk in front of PNC's corporate headquarters. Next we trained more of our supporters to become action leaders themselves, so that by December 1, 2012, we could pull off fifteen bank actions in five states and the District of Columbia, demonstrating a major expansion of our capacity. When we returned to Pittsburgh the next April, we intended to make it impossible for PNC's annual shareholders' meeting to proceed as usual, even though that meant risking arrest. Although police outnumbered the 16 of us in the meeting, our protest led the CEO to shut down his meeting. For the first time, the bank publicly defended its investment policies, a sign that we were making an impact.In 2013, we also adopted new approaches designed to pressure PNC decision-makers. Targeting PNC board members and high-ranking bank officials, we have been showing up where they least expect us -- from charity events to a breakfast in Britain, where British Quakers confronted Philadelphia-based PNC board member Jane Pepper about the bank's financing of mountaintop removal. We publicly challenge the bank's good-corporate-neighbor image, staging creative actions at events that it sponsors.During PowerShift, we conducted trainings, reached out to students from across the country, and worked with allies from other organizations, who helped us pull off our ambitious plans. During the course of Monday, PNC locked the doors of five branches, scrambling to respond to both organized bands of protestors and individual students who had been instructed to deposit a penny a piece in a designated account in order to slowdown the bank's lunchtime business. Students in Philadelphia who could not make it to PowerShift showed solidarity by depositing pennies at the PNC branch at Temple University.   As the mid-day actions wound down, supporters of EQAT made their way to 600 Grant St, where seven Earth Quakers stood outside a locked PNC Branch, speaking about their concern for the people of Appalachia. As had been planned, Johannah Cordonhill, Ryan Leitner, Amy Ward Brimmer, Ben Shapiro, Michael Gagne, Walter Hjelt-Sullivan and George Lakey refused to leave when asked by police and were subsequently arrested amid the defiant singing of their supporters. It was close to twenty-four hours before they were all released on bail. On Monday, October 28, a judge sentenced them to time-served.In addition to increasing pressure on PNC bank, one of EQAT's goals was to model strategic concepts like escalation for the activists at PowerShift. At the end of the day, one ally said, \"I've been doing bank actions for a long time now and I learned so much today. I will be taking these lessons back to my own work.\"Parts of this article were previously posted on Waging Nonviolence."}, {"title": "USDA Plan To Speed Up Poultry-Processing Lines Could Increase Risk Of Bird Abuse - The Washington Post", "text": "Nearly 1 million chickens and turkeys are unintentionally boiled alive each year in U.S. slaughterhouses, often because fast-moving lines fail to kill the birds before they are dropped into scalding water, U.S. Department of Agriculture records show.Read more on The Washington Post"}, {"title": "One Year After Sandy, Many Coastlines Are Still Vulnerable To Storm Surges (INFOGRAPHIC)", "text": "Are Baltimore and Biloxi the next New York City and Jersey Shore?

Each part of the framework however, has been substantially weakened -- the civil justice systems by years of tort \"reform,\" and federal and state regulatory systems by outdated laws and an ongoing campaign by industry and its allies against protective regulation.Congress is now considering competing bills to fix one part of this framework -- the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the principal statute governing federal regulation of toxic chemicals. The two bills -- the more protective Safer Chemical Act (SCA) and the industry-backed Chemical Safety Improvements Act (CSIA) -- both fall short of what is needed to fix TSCA, albeit to a widely varying degree -- while weakening the civil justice systems and state regulation even more.To be sure, TSCA reform is overdue. The statute's inadequate data-gathering provisions have prevented the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) -- the agency charged with implementing TSCA -- from obtaining critical information on the potential hazards of the tens of thousands of chemicals currently on the market. And even when the EPA is able to confirm that a chemical is dangerous, TSCA provides the agency with little authority to take meaningful action to protect against the health or environmental risks the substance poses.While neither of the two leading TSCA reform proposals -- the SCA and the CSIA -- do enough to strengthen federal regulatory public protections against toxic chemicals, the CSIA would take a significant step backwards by effectively eliminating the two other parts of the framework -- the state and federal civil justice systems and state regulation. The CSIA would preempt state and federal tort law by granting partial immunity to industrial chemical manufacturers and users whose activities have been deemed \"safe\" by the EPA. The CSIA would also broadly preempt state efforts to request that manufacturers supply data regarding their chemicals and prohibit state and local governments from regulating a particular chemical in any way once the EPA has prioritized that chemical for further assessment.Center for Progressive Reform Member Scholars Emily Hammond, Thomas McGarity, Wendy Wagner and CPR Senior Policy Analyst James Goodwin and I have written an Issue Alert that seeks to explain how each part of the three-part protective framework contributes to reducing the risks posed by chemicals, and we recommend ways that TSCA reform can strengthen all three parts of the protective framework.In the Alert we focus on the need to:\u2022 Include a savings clause providing that nothing that the EPA does under TSCA shall affect the right of an injured party to sue the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of a chemical substance in a common law court;\u2022 Specifically allow state and local governments to continue enforcing any regulations that are already in effect when the EPA issues a new TSCA regulation that covers the same chemical substances;\u2022 Authorize state and local governments to issue new regulations that are more stringent than the EPA's existing TSCA regulations, unless the chemical industry is able to demonstrate that simultaneous compliance with both is impossible;\u2022 Give the EPA broader authority to demand information from the chemical industry on potentially toxic chemicals;\u2022 Strengthen TSCA's chemical testing provisions by establishing a list of high-priority chemicals for chemical risk assessment and including statutory deadlines, enforceable through citizen suits, for completing these assessments;\u2022 Shift the burden to chemical manufacturers to test new chemicals before they enter the marketplace;\u2022 Enhance the EPA's authority to take effective regulatory action to protect the public against chemicals that pose unacceptable health or environmental risks.As Congress undertakes the critical task of overhauling TSCA, it must aim to strengthen the federal regulatory provisions of the statute while allowing the state and federal civil justice systems and state regulation to play as active a role as possible in safeguarding the public against toxic chemicals. A stronger federal regulatory program to address toxic chemicals is essential, but it must not come at the cost of robust and energized state and federal civil justice systems and state regulation."}, {"title": "Community Rallies Against 'Wart On The Hillside,' Sustainably Designed Cabin In Washington", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Matt Hickman:Today, a quick update on a heated story out of the close-knit community of Mazama, Wash. that I first reported on back in June that involves blatantly disregarded protective covenants, the preservation of the natural beauty of the upper Methow Valley, and an ill-situated modernist prefab cabin designed by a celebrated architect whose entire coffee table book-friendly oeuvre, ironically, revolves around stunning structures that meld harmoniously into the landscapes surrounding them.  Since the grassroots Move the Hut campaign was launched last summer by outraged and betrayed Methow Valley residents, the offending hut in question \u2014 Seattle-based Tom Kundig's sustainably designed weekend getaway that juts precariously over a cliff atop Flagg Mountain for everyone to see, like it or not \u2014 has not been moved and a lawsuit that seeks \"a restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctions and damages for violation of the protective covenants placed on the property by former property owners\" will have its first trial date in 2014.  Still, the campaign grows all the more strong and, according to a recent email sent to me by Move the Hut volunteer Kathryn Hinsch, over 700 supporters have signed an online petition urging Kundig and co-owner/builder Jim Dow to be good neighbors and do the right thing by relocating the accused eyesore of a cabin \u2014 one resident describes it as a \"wart on a hillside\" \u2014 to a less conspicuous location. Writes Hinsch: \"Our support is primarily local and the Puget Sound area, but also encompasses Methow Valley visitors, and activists involved in deterring ridgeline building, such as in Vermont, where there is state-wide regulation. We have continued to try to educate the public on the issue and why it is important to the upper Methow Valley.\"  Filmmaker Katie Turinski has also released a short documentary chronicling the battle titled \"Moving Mazama.\" It's an interesting watch not just for those familiar with this area of Washington state or the work of Kundig (I'm admittedly a huge fan) but for anyone who has had a cherished view soiled by someone who doesn't seem to give a toss about playing by the rules, compromising, or respecting the neighbors.   Explains John Hayes, a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Kundig and Dow: \"They knew what they were doing. They took this brave move. Well, this brave move backfired. The community has drawn a line in the sand. We're not big on litigious activity but we didn't ask for this one.\"  Hayes' sentiments are echoed by Bill Pope, a longtime local business owner and Mazama resident who's heading up the Move the Hut campaign: \"It really came to me to start this website and all that because we want to make sure that our feelings are taken seriously as a community. It takes a fair amount of aggravation, I guess, for the community to kind of rise up. But once they do, they become very involved which is kind of what has happened here.\" He adds: \"Kundig will not be embraced by the community if we're all left looking up at the hut. I mean what is the point of having something like that if the community is going to feel like you're not being a good neighbor?\"  Take a look and let me know what you think.

Now as part of this year's Jakarta Fashion Week, Cruelty Free International and The Body Shop, joined by hundreds of supporters, called on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to make the region cruelty-free.ASEAN, headquartered in Jakarta, consists of ten Southeast Asian nations including the rapidly-growing emerging countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. ASEAN is the body responsible for regulating animal testing in cosmetics for countries in the region. As is the case in the United States, and many other countries, in ASEAN there are currently no regulations or laws banning animal testing of cosmetic products and ingredients or the importing of those tested elsewhere.ASEAN's Heads of Delegation will now discuss Cruelty Free International's proposal to ban cosmetics testing across the region at the ASEAN Cosmetics Committee in Kuala Lumpur this November. This is a real breakthrough and follows a Cruelty Free International funded project in Vietnam to convert to non-animal alternatives. Vietnam is the only country in ASEAN that actively tests cosmetics on animals, but during a visit by Cruelty Free International last year the Vietnamese State testing laboratories reached an agreement in principle to convert to non-animal tests for cosmetics.ASEAN has traditionally matched EU legislation and Cruelty Free International are hoping they will follow suit on the issue of cosmetics testing. Indeed, when it comes to cosmetics testing on animals the writing is on the wall -- animal tests are outdated, unethical, and ultimately doomed.While the ethical case for ending cosmetics testing on animals has been well-established for years, the European ban on the sale of any new animal-tested cosmetic has made an economic case for companies around the world to change their business model and switch to modern non-animal testing methods. Cruelty Free International has been encouraging a ripple effect from the EU ban by working within a number of countries including Korea, Brazil, China, the USA and Vietnam.To keep the issue at the forefront of the public consciousness and to draw further attention from decision makers around the world, Cruelty Free International partnered with The Body Shop to collect over one million signatures in support of a global ban on animal tested cosmetics by asking Body Shop customers in stores across 65 countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Korea, Japan and Russia to sign the pledge. This was largest and most ambitious campaign ever to seek a global ban on the use of animals to test cosmetics.In a global market it is important that all countries ban the practice to avoid animal testing from simply being moved around the world to those countries without a ban. The EU has shown that a ban is possible, and now over a million consumer voices have spoken and, it seems, that Southeast Asia is paying attention."}, {"title": "Despite Policy Changes, Hurricane Sandy Hasn't Shifted Climate Change Narrative", "text": "From Climate Central's Brian Kahn:Click on the search terms to see the corresponding trends analysis.In the year since Hurricane Sandy struck the Mid-Atlantic, news articles have widely declared that the storm has \u201cchanged the public\u2019s view of weather threats\u201d and that \u201cresilience\u201d would be the environmental buzzword of 2013. That sounds all well and good, but are headlines enough to move public opinion and spark new discussions?Signs seem to point to \u201cno.\u201d Policy has moved forward in a number of the states most affected by Sandy. But the broader U.S. public has shown little interest in carrying that conversation to the national level, and despite proclamations otherwise, the media has been equally disengaged.\u201cClimate adaptation,\u201d \u201cdisaster preparedness,\u201d and \u201csea level rise\u201d \u2014 the most robust tie between Sandy and manmade global warming \u2014 are three key terms associated with Sandy.A weekly breakdown of search data in the U.S. shows that in the run up to and immediate aftermath of Sandy, the public showed a greater interest in those terms. But interest quickly waned, and there\u2019s been no discernible trend in the year since the storm.Even in New York City, which bore the brunt of Sandy\u2019s impacts and has put forth a $19.5 billion climate resiliency plan, interest has been ephemeral. Looking at city-level searches, the same pattern than happened nationally played out locally.Equal or even greater spikes in search interest are noticeable around other climate events as well. For example, searches for \u201cclimate adaptation\u201d spiked following Hurricane Irene and a Halloween snowstorm in 2011. Searches for \"adaptation\" following those storms were on par with Sandy, despite smaller economic losses.Interest in \u201cadaptation\u201d as well as \u201csea level rise\u201d also rose in early December 2011 and late November 2012. Those peaks coincided with the annual United Nations climate negotiations. During the 2012 negotiations in Doha, Qatar, a major sea level rise report was released and the amount of searches during that period for that term actually topped searches during Sandy. However, even those big peaks failed to produce longer-lasting trends, as interest dropped back down to a baseline level.Ironically, though the media declared Sandy a conversation changer, there\u2019s been no major shift in media coverage either. Searching newspapers, magazines, newswires, and other media shows the same post-Sandy peak in coverage mentioning the three terms but no major changes in the long run.Only \u201csea level rise\u201d shows an upward trend in coverage since Sandy. There\u2019s been almost no trend in coverage mentioning \u201cdisaster preparedness\u201d and even a slight downward trend in coverage mentioning \u201cclimate adaptation.\u201d\"I think there\u2019s not a lot of leadership or enterprise in science and enviromental writing as we would hope given cutbacks in the mainstream media,\" said Cristine Russell, a veteran science writer and senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School. \"Reporters on this story, as well as others, tend to be a little reactive rather than proactive.\"That means that once it seems like people know the story, reporters stop covering it. \"Even extreme weather has run its cycle,\" she said, noting that 2012 was a year of extremes so the comparative calm in 2013 could have also helped cause the dip.So why didn\u2019t Sandy, a storm that blacked out parts of the media capital of the country, have staying power?Part of the challenge could be timescales. Following an extreme weather event, there are inevitably questions about the role climate change plays and how society should plan for future extreme events going forward. However, science often lags behind public interest and the understanding of how, if at all, climate change contributes to a specific event can often take months, if not years, for scientists to get a handle on.In the case of Sandy, an extreme events study released on Sept. 5, 2013, nearly 10 months after the storm, said: \u201cSandy is probably one of the most difficult extreme events of 2012 to fully explain.\u201dWith public interest faded, restarting the conversation with a phrase like that is like trying to get the wheels turning on a bike with a rusted chain.Sandy was a large storm, but it also left a large part of the U.S. unscathed. And much of the country will never have to deal with hurricanes, so while Lower Manhattan blacked out might be a powerful image, the hazard isn\u2019t something that\u2019s universally relatable.There\u2019s also a third, simpler explanation for why Sandy failed to change the conversation: people simply don\u2019t change their minds easily.\u201cIn public opinion, we don\u2019t often see things move dramatically,\u201d said Chris Borick, the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s more the norm that people don\u2019t change their views than do change their views, especially when something becomes more entrenched with ideological and political arguments.\u201dClimate change fits into that category. Polls by Borick and others show not only that opinions about whether it\u2019s happening falling down party lines, but also that there\u2019s little movement from one opinion to the other.Instead, events like Sandy just shift how people frame their attitudes. Borick found that shortly after Sandy, 42 percent of those that accepted that climate change is occurring cited the strength of hurricanes hitting the U.S. as evidence for their opinion. The month prior to Sandy, that number stood at just 26 percent.The same phenomenon was also on display for skeptics following the snowy winter of 2010-11. Borick\u2019s polls found a major uptick in the number of skeptics citing snowstorms as the reason for their belief. In both the cases, there was only a slight shift in overall public opinion one way or the other.\u201cYou have these existing beliefs and now you\u2019re connecting the events as a way of confirming those views,\u201d Borick said.Ezra Markowitz, a postdoctorial researcher at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University, echoed Borick\u2019s views. \u201cThe relationship between personal experience and engagement goes both ways,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople's perceived personal experience of climate change-related events increases their certainty about the problem, but also people's preexisting beliefs influence how they experience an event.\u201dIn that light, proclamations that Sandy would change minds or stir national interest appear myopic. Though it has happened, it\u2019s exceedingly rare for single events to cause big shifts.Borick cited Watergate and the Vietnam War as two events that had profound impacts on the public\u2019s level of trust in the government. The impact of those two events was so profound that in the nearly 40 years since Watergate, Americans\u2019 trust in the government has never fully rebounded.Other events not previously on the public\u2019s radar can also capture the cultural zeitgeist more easily.\u201cIn the case of Kony 2012, you got a lot of interest really quickly,\u201d Markowitz said, referring to a viral campaign against an African warlord. \u201cYou got tens of millions of people to pay attention to an issue they never paid attention to before in a few weeks time.\u201dBroad public interest has since dissipated, but not before public opinion convinced President Obama to commit special forces to seeking out Kony and led Congress to pass a bill offering a reward for his arrest.In addition to climate change being a polarizing topic, many of the ways to address it come down to government interventions, a topic that also falls along sharply divided lines. Clearing that hurdle is a tall one.Russell believes more local coverage of the connection between climate and extreme weather and how they affect communities is one way over it.\"In 2014, there will be more in the IPCC about impacts and adaptation and that may spark more local coverage and concern,\" she said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report. The first part released last month focused more on the physical science of climate change.Markowitz echoed that, saying, \u201cLarge-scale events can be focusing events, as a jumping off point, but not as everything.\u201d"}, {"title": "Democracy and Farming", "text": "The industrialization of agriculture in late nineteenth century gave a new lease of life to pesticides. Now that machines made farms large, chemicals became convenient tools to maintain and expand the new industrialized plantations.Second, the money and political power of large farmers convinced scientists to argue that pesticides are essential for food production.This misuse of science made pesticides almost a religion. To this day, any discussion or policy of excluding pesticides from farming brings to the surface a storm of protest by the followers of this toxic but profitable religion.The global annual earnings from pesticides are about $40 billion.  I have been a witness to this theological debate in dozens of farm conferences. But, in one of those conferences, in Minnesota, I was struck by the \"popularity\" of farm sprays, even among environmentalists.This memorable three-day \"retreat\" near Minneapolis took place in June 1996. This was the age of Bill Clinton who, like Barack Obama, came to power promising liberal reforms, including better environmental protection. 1996 was also thirty-six years after Rachel Carson warned the country of the dangers of pesticides. However, as I observed in the conference, the chill of corporate power engulfed everything.The conference was about pesticides and sustainable agriculture -- two antithetical options feeding the monster of agribusiness.Two non-governmental organizations, the Minneapolis-based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the Iowa State University's Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, sponsored the conference. The EPA funded it. I was then working for the EPA, but I did not represent EPA at the conference.The purpose of the conference was to mix environmentalists and agrotoxin merchants to come up with a \"win-win\" proposition. I immediately rejected such a preposterous scheme.I proposed to my working group we forget the agrotoxins and address instead the burning social and political issues of how we could make agriculture sustainable once again. I understood \"sustainable\" to mean friendly to the small family farmers and to the natural world.My conference colleagues, including a pesticides company representative, disagreed with me. As a result, we wasted three days over trivial, jargon-loaded platitudes over agriculture and rural development.The poison lobbyist in my group, a person from the Midwest, was boiling mad with my defense of family farming and organic agriculture. She threatened me, saying I was the reason she commanded a high salary. She said it was inconceivable that anyone could envision an agricultural system without pesticides. She also admitted her company was behind the governor of Minnesota vetoing a bill designed to enlighten the people of Minnesota on the benefits of sustainable agriculture.My colleagues, who had gone out of their way to accommodate the pesticide lobbyist, got angry. They were astonished by her hubris. The coordinator apologized to me because she and the other members of the working group had tried to restrain me in order to give equal time to the pesticide lobbyist.Nevertheless, in all meetings the representatives of agribusiness were like the honor guests, the fountains of knowledge, the makers of policy, people of power.The thirty or so members of the conference adored the makers of poisons that, fundamentally, have been destroying the small ecological farming of America. Bur three of my colleagues spoke to me confidentially that they appreciated my contribution, helping them to think about sustainable agriculture and its relationship to democracy.Yet the conference voted against me overwhelmingly, rejecting my proposal that a healthy democracy needed a healthy agriculture of millions of small family farmers. My proposal received just two votes: mine and that of the Canadian woman coordinator.The profit of the conference was in the people I met and the pleasure of spending some time in harmony with nature. The small lake facing the dormitories was like a huge liquid jewel.I walked to the shore of the lake both days at six in the morning. I listened intensely to the music of wildlife. I enjoyed the aesthetic beauty of the deep green trees and the lilies and water plants floating on the water, the quiet waves kissing the sand at my feet. I also explored the lake with a canoe.In the evening of the second day a small group of the conference participants enjoyed the company of each other, drinking beer in a close circle around a bright wood fire while a young \"crop adviser\" sang beautifully and played a cithara and a harmonica.There, in the deep darkness of the woods, next to the glistering lake, underneath the bright trembling stars of a clear sky, I let the beauty of the space sink in to replace the daily ugliness of human affairs, the very tragic / comic discussion staged in support of the destroyers of both agriculture and civic life in this country.But the gods must have been hovering somewhere near me. I felt light and happy."}, {"title": "New Poll: Is Attacking the EPA the Bright Idea Tea Partiers Think It Is?", "text": "This fall, an extreme minority in Congress made a massive miscalculation when they shut down the government at an estimated cost of $24 billion and threatened an even bigger economic crisis -- defaulting on our debt -- all in the name of repealing the president's health care law. It was an extreme agenda that backfired coast to coast. And now, some in Congress are taking aim at another priority -- the environment. This week alone, while the country memorializes the anniversary of Super-Storm Sandy, we will see a pro-coal rally at the Capitol as well as hearings and new legislation to limit the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution.Yet, according to a new poll of swing Senate states conducted by Hart Research for the League of Conservation Voters, it seems that the same Tea Party extremists may be making another misstep with their attacks on the EPA, the science of climate change, and those working for a safe and healthy future.Attacks on the EPA are falling flat. Voters trust the EPA, not a Congress with single-digit approval ratings, to decide whether we need regulations that will reduce carbon pollution. In fact, the polling in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia, showed that nearly three in every four voters in these swing Senate states support EPA regulations that would set limits on the amount of carbon pollution from power plants.Our poll of swing states looked at the attacks that we hear every day from anti-science politicians, and put them up against the facts. We put the best arguments for limiting carbon pollution -- like how the EPA pollution safeguards could spark innovation and result in a net increase jobs -- against the attacks most often used by climate change deniers and other critics backed by polluting industries like Big Oil. And the results showed just how out of touch the Tea Party and their allies really are.The anti-environmental message is a losing argument with the American people. After voters hear arguments for and against the regulations, support for them increases. A solid majority of voters -- 64 percent -- say they want their senator to support these EPA regulations. And it's worth repeating, this is in swing states.The polling also reinforced what we have already learned about Americans' low tolerance for climate change deniers. Solid majorities in swing states won by either President Obama or Governor Romney last cycle said they would be less favorable to a candidate for Senate if they deny climate change.These findings are a reminder of just how out of touch the Tea Party wing of Congress is on environmental issues. People want action, not temper tantrums. The American people are ready for a government that solves problems while growing our economy and protecting our environment."}, {"title": "The Carbon Bubble, Carbon Budget and Canada's Tar Sands", "text": "It's hard to know when a once radical idea goes mainstream, but we're probably at that point with the carbon bubble. If you're unfamiliar with the term here's a quick definition. Basically, the carbon bubble is the idea that fossil fuel companies are overvalued because if and when the world ever gets serious about dealing with the climate crisis, the fossil fuel companies won't be able to burn their carbon reserves, from which they derive their value.Bill McKibben wrote about this idea last year in Rolling Stone, in an article that went strangely viral. In fact, the article got more hits than the Justin Bieber profile that appeared in the same edition of the magazine. Clearly this idea is hitting a nerve.It's not just environmentalists that are pushing this idea. The World Bank, London School of Economics and the International Energy Agency -- all not exactly hippy outfits -- have put out warnings about a carbon budget, the upper limit of how much carbon we can burn and have a reasonable chance of not raising global temperatures more than 2 degrees C, a target that every country, including Canada, has agreed is the red line that we shouldn't cross.The carbon budget creates the carbon bubble. The idea of carbon budget received a boost a few weeks back when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sounded the alarm for immediate action on climate change and the necessity for keeping much of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. The IPCC is made up of 2,000 of the top climate scientists in the world. If they say there is a budget, we ought to listen.The budget is about 565 gigatons of CO2 (A gigaton is a billion tons). That sounds like a lot, and it is. The problem is we are blowing through about 31GtCO2 a year, meaning we will spend our budget in about 15-25 years.Here's where Canada and the tar sands come in. Calculations performed by 350.org, using industry filings and commonly accepted carbon accounting, show that the tar sands industry's 170 billion barrels of economically viable proven reserves are estimated to take up about 17 percent of the world's remaining carbon budget, or about 1/6 of what we have left to burn.When you stop to think about it, that's a big, big problem for Canada, the financial markets, and the world's climate system. For Canada, it means that an over-reliance on the tar sands as an economic drive is a huge risk if the world ever regulates greenhouse gas emissions. It doesn't make a ton of sense to build your economy around a product that can't be sold or used.For the markets, it means that companies that are heavily invested in the tar sands could be hugely over-valued, and therefor an existential threat to the economy. Suncor, TransCanada, and Shell are all betting big, along with Harper, that the world will never deal with the climate crisis. That'a a bad bet if you care about the stability of the markets.And for the world, there must be a reckoning between physics and business as usual. Physics, who is undefeated to date, is telling us that we can only burn so much carbon and stay below our safe limit. Business as usual, championed by global conglomerates like Exxon and Chevron, are banking on us not getting serious about saving the planet.Who will win just might determine the fate of the climate -- and our economy."}, {"title": "Fox Biz Pushes Global Warming Denial on Sandy Anniversary", "text": "On Monday, Rupert Murdoch's Fox Business Network exploited the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy to promote the conspiracy theory that climate science is a liberal fiction. Referring to the catastrophic storm, Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney railed against the \"global warming agenda\" of the \"mainstream media.\"Varney's guest, the conservative Media Research Center's Dan Gainor, complained that of the 32 segments in network news his group found that mentioned Sandy and global warming, only two questioned the overwhelming science that the increasing greenhouse effect from the combustion of fossil fuels is accelerating sea level rise and making weather more extreme and chaotic.Despite numerous scientific attribution studies on wildfires, heat waves, droughts, and storms that have found global warming fingerprints, Gainor falsely claimed that \"we cannot link climate change or global warming to a specific event.\" He furthermore dismissed the decades of work by thousands of scientists in all earth-science disciplines that provide our understanding of climate change as \"stuff\" and \"guesswork.\"Gainor did not emphasize that his organization found only 32 mentions of climate change and Sandy in an entire year of network news coverage. (In contrast, for example, there were 52 segments on Iran's nuclear program in five months of network news coverage from November 2011 to March 2012.)Climate denial is rampant in the financial press, not just the media organs owned by Murdoch like Fox and The Wall Street Journal. Forbes regularly publishes climate-denial columns, and Reuters editors are openly hostile to climate science. And Comcast's CNBC features hosts such as Joe Kernen, who argues that the findings of climate science are a plot concocted by a \"bonafide cult\" of \"enviro-socialists\" and the \"eco-taliban.\"Varney and Gainor bemoaned as \"media censorship\" the public stand the Los Angeles Times has taken against global warming denial in its opinion pages. Over 25,000 people have signed a petition from climate accountability organization Forecast the Facts calling on the nation's other major papers, including The New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post, to follow suit.The anemic response of Wall Street -- the Fox Business Network's primary audience -- to Hurricane Sandy's wake-up call on global warming has sparked debate. On Sunday, Forecast the Facts hosted a forum held in downtown New York City looking at the role of Wall Street in financing the climate change that threatens New York's future prosperity. The panelists of the Turning the Tide forum, including Center for American Progress senior fellow Bracken Hendricks, Tom Steyer adviser Kate Gordon, and New Economy Lab's James Slezak, discussed how the financial industry needs to reject the anti-scientific arguments pushed by Murdoch's media properties and the Koch brothers' network of politicians, think tanks, and advocacy groups.Gordon cited the Risky Business initative, led by Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. The initiative, Gordon explained, is meant not only to provide an economic assessment of the risk exposure different companies and industries have to man-made global warming, but also to change the culture of the financial sector. With that goal in mind, influential Republicans and conservatives who accept the basic science of climate change have been courted.Wall Street is at a crossroads, all the panelists agreed. On the path of fossil-fuel companies and climate deniers like New York City's richest man, carbon financier David H. Koch, lies accelerating sea level rise and intensifying storms that will swamp the islands of New York City. But the investors and analysts can choose another path, recognize the science, and invest in a sustainable, resilient future that will save their city."}, {"title": "One Year After Sandy, a Moment to Look Back and Face the Future", "text": "One year ago today, Hurricane Sandy ravaged the northeast coast of the United States, doing billions in damage to homes and businesses and tragically taking over 100 lives. Coastal communities in New York and New Jersey were devastated and some are still recovering. National Wildlife Refuges across the East Coast suffered damage from debris, flooding and erosion, including New Jersey's Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, Pea Island in North Carolina and Chincoteague, one of my favorite refuges in Virginia. This storm turned the lives and careers of thousands of people upside down and the environmental impact was extensive. Scientists warn that climate change could make extreme weather events more frequent, and it is almost certain that Sandy will not be the only superstorm we see in our lifetime.Thankfully, the Obama administration and the federal government has begun to take action to address the impacts of climate change. In a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation, Congress quickly passed a $50.4 billion emergency bill to fund Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. The bill included a crucial amendment providing $360 million to Department of the Interior programs to \"increase the resiliency and capacity of coastal habitat and infrastructure to withstand future storms and reduce the amount of damage caused by such storms.\" It was an important major step in the right direction.Just last week, the Department of the Interior announced $162 million in projects funded by the Sandy relief bill to better protect coastal communities from storms through restoration work. Secretary Jewell stated that \"our public lands are often the best defense against Mother Nature.\" This is a great outcome: Defenders worked hard to make sure the habitat resilience and restoration funding requested by the administration was included in the House and Senate Sandy supplemental bills.Throughout the year, the Obama administration made significant efforts to act on climate change. President Obama pledged to face the challenge head-on in his State of the Union speech. Soon to follow was the March release of the National Fish, Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy, a set of guidelines for restoring wildlife habitat and improving its resilience in the face of climate change. In June, President Obama unveiled his new Climate Action Plan, and Defenders' own climate expert Noah Matson is part of the new Department of the Interior Advisory Committee on Climate Change Science.The Sandy anniversary is also a good time to assess what we want from our lawmakers and the administration on this issue going forward. I'm excited to see the Interior Department's efforts to restore wetlands, marshes, beaches and other coastal areas through the funding from the relief bill. These projects will help buffer communities and benefit the wildlife these habitats support, making 2014 a year of further progress for storm-stricken areas.Reducing emissions is also part of a comprehensive climate change response. Recently the EPA proposed unprecedented new guidelines requiring new power plants to capture or store 40 percent of their greenhouse gas output to help combat climate change. The administration is standing up to the climate change deniers working to scuttle these important rules. It is vital that we reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we release into our atmosphere, while also working to adapt our natural resources to the effects of climate change we are already experiencing. So, while the Interior Department's storm-buffering work is without precedent, we need to keep the momentum going on climate adaptation in the United States.Creating the National Fish, Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy was an important and necessary first step; now it's time to implement it for the long-term. That means that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service and National Park Service need full funding and access to the resources they need to do this important work. Fortifying wildlife habitat can help people, communities and wildlife weather the climate change impacts affecting us right now, and that means coastline restoration, land protection and fire management programs. Congress must fully fund our wildlife agencies when it votes on the federal budget in January.As we look ahead to the new year, let's remember the hard work so many people did to begin the repairs and to restore the places struck by Hurricane Sandy, from first responders to federal workers to citizen volunteers. Let's recognize the coming year as an opportunity to begin a new, proactive approach to climate change and extreme weather so we can be better prepared for the next Sandy. And let's look forward to this time next year, when hopefully we will look back at 2014 and see that we have made a difference."}, {"title": "5 Things Hurricane Sandy Changed For Good", "text": "By Becky Oskin, LiveScience Staff Writer:Some people and places may never be the same since Hurricane Sandy hit the northern Atlantic Coast on Oct. 29, 2012. The lingering effects include lives lost and irreplaceable mementos. Barrier islands were changed forever. But the vulnerabilities revealed by Superstorm Sandy could also help make the East Coast better prepared for the next big hurricane.Here are five ways Hurricane Sandy totally changed the East Coast:1. Hurricane warnings revampedSuperstorm Sandy was a \"post-tropical cyclone\" \u2014 not a hurricane \u2014 when it pummeled the northern Atlantic Coast. This meant responsibility for storm warnings had shifted from the National Hurricane Center to the National Weather Service and its fleet of local weather offices. Instead of one unified message, there was a flurry of individual warnings from the weather offices, resulting in widespread confusion about the nature of the threat from Sandy, according to an assessment by the University of Pennsylvania published in November 2012.Now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees both agencies, has changed its policy. Even if a massive storm like Sandy drops below the tropical-storm category, the National Hurricane Center can still issue storm watches and warnings.2. Barrier islands shiftBarrier islands are the long, thin offshore islands that help protect the mainland from a powerful beating by storms. Superstorm Sandy pummeled barrier islands in New York and New Jersey. New York's Fire Island lost more than half of its beach and dune sand. In Mantoloking, N.J. (a borough of Ocean City, N.J.), almost the entire dune vanished from the borough's barrier island. Waves also breached, or cut through, islands in both states.Hurricane Sandy severely eroded dunes and lowered the beach elevation on Fire Island in New York.3. Flood evacuation zonesDrowning poses the highest risk of death during hurricanes. New evacuation zones in New York City and new storm-surge maps for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts will help save lives in the next storm.In New York City, the worst damage came from Sandy's storm surge. The flooding went beyond the city's mandatory evacuation zone. The new maps add 600,000 more people to possible evacuation zones and divide residents into six zones, for a more detailed risk evaluation. [Storm Surge Video: Deadliest Part of a Hurricane]In July 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey released a new assessment of coastal vulnerability to storm-surge flooding and erosion from hurricanes.4. New York gets phone friendlyImmediately after Hurricane Sandy, New Yorkers who still had power snaked extension cords and power strips out their doors and windows so strangers could charge their phones. A lifeline in the days following the storm, these impromptu charging stations are now a permanent feature. AT&T began installing solar-powered charging stations in June 2013 at 25 parks, beaches and other popular outdoor spaces throughout the five boroughs.5. Lost homesSome people will never move back home \u2014 their houses were on sand washed inland or taken out to sea. Others have accepted federally funded buyouts, including 300 homeowners on New York's Staten Island who have agreed to a permanent move. They will sell their homes, which will be razed and converted into a park or back to marshland.Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

I'm guessing you'd prefer to have someone who is both courageous and principled, rather than someone too scared to stand up for something, right?I ask because this week House Energy and Power Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-Ky) released a draft bill to be introduced in both bodies of Congress that would repeal EPA's recently proposed rules to reduce the dangerous carbon pollution at new power plants and hamstring expected rules limiting carbon pollution from existing plants. These plants are responsible for 40 percent of our country's total carbon pollution, and are major driver of changes we're already seeing, and paying for, in our climate. Despite that reality, members of the House and Senate will be under intense pressure from the fossil fuel industry (to the tune of $139 million in lobbying so far this year*) to sign on to these misguided bills. We expect the industry to put especially heavy pressure on Senators facing competitive elections next year. Those senators have a choice: run clean or run scared.While no single issue can guarantee victory, our in-depth research shows that running clean is both smart policy and smart politics. Running clean can be part of a winning campaign even in red states with strong fossil fuel industries. As I wrote earlier this month, that's true in large part because Americans of all political stripes support action on climate change. Members of Congress have a moral obligation to support policies that protect the health and well-being of their constituents. Choosing to run clean can be an important component of a smart campaign narrative that emphasizes local issues and communicates a candidate's values. These reasons represent the \"smart politics\" side of the equation.But just in case anyone has forgotten the \"smart policy\" side of the coin, here are a few reasons why acting on climate change -- not cowering in fear of the fossil fuel industry -- makes sense in a few key states.Arkansas: Incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor and his challenger in the 2014 election, Rep. Tom Cotton, would be wise to focus on the impact of climate change on agriculture (the largest industry in Arkansas). The entire state was already declared a natural disaster area last year due to drought, which is exacerbated by climate change. An increase in extreme heat days is expected to lead to reduced agricultural production. In Arkansas, farmers agree that \"weather patterns that seem more extreme\" are occurring, even though some are skeptical of a \"climate change\" message. With the potential for 5.7 million GWh of renewable energy, the state is ready to be an engine of a clean energy economy.Indiana: Agriculture represented more than $8 billion in value for Hoosiers in the most recently available census. Recently elected Sen. Joe Donnelly must remember that climate change threatens this economic engine. After the 2012 summer drought, corn, and alfalfa hay production fell by about 30% each compared to the previous year. Likewise, natural disasters can cause hundreds of millions of dollars in crop losses. With wind, solar and biomass energy and clean vehicles manufacturing already creating jobs and the potential for 5.8 million GWh of renewable energy, the state is ready to be an engine of a clean energy economy.Louisiana: Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Bill Cassidy were doubtless profoundly affected by the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which cost their home state $250 billion. Climate change makes severe storms more likely. In addition, severe storms accelerate the loss of coastal wetlands. With wind energy and clean vehicles manufacturing already creating jobs and the potential for 5.9 million GWh of renewable energy, the state is ready to be an engine of a clean energy economy.North Dakota: Recently elected Sen. Heidi Heitkamp knows that agriculture is worth $6 billion in her state. The industry is threatened by extreme weather events and other climate change impacts. For example, in January of this year, USDA declared 16 counties to be primary natural disaster areas due to various weather-related causes. With North Dakota's potential to generate more than 13 million GWh of renewable energy, the state is ready to create clean energy jobs.We all know what is coming: a barrage of dirty energy spending that makes false claims about the cost of reducing carbon pollution (including the serious health implications) and ignores the high costs of inaction on climate change. As legislators consider whether to sign on to anti-climate bills, they'll have to decide whether they'll be ready to run clean or if they'll just be running scared. They should choose to run clean. That's where the smart money is.*Combined oil and gas and electric industry spending."}, {"title": "Australian Boutique Tries To Sell Bottled Moonlight, Organic Air, For A Cause (VIDEO)", "text": "Feeling out of sorts?

(Warning: Not suitable for pessimists or negative nancies.)If that doesn't tickle your fancy, Dup\u00e9 (pronounced \"due\u2022pey\"), a pop-up shop in Australia, has a bevy of other options, including bottles of all-natural February moonlight (\"feeds up to five night skies\"), jars of pure organic fresh air (\"sourced from the most pristine atmosphere\") and boxes of eco-friendly rays of sunshine (available in two sizes: Aurora Maximus and Aurora Petite).If you haven't already guessed, Dup\u00e9 is a fake shop. But it is serving a real purpose on behalf of Yarra Valley Water, the utility company in charge of supplying water and sewer services to Melbourne, Australia.The company is on a campaign against bottled water, encouraging consumers to instead fill up reusable bottles with municipal tap water.

(Yes, Dup\u00e9 sells those as well, promising they've been \"filtered through three layers of ultra-fine cool dudes\").Throw in the fact that Australians recycle less than 50 percent of their plastic bottles, and the case against drinking bottled water becomes as airtight as the jars Dup\u00e9 uses to store its organic fresh air.WATCH a video of consumers at the Dup\u00e9 store, above."}, {"title": "The Next Superstorm: Will Congress Protect Us?", "text": "One year ago, Superstorm Sandy ripped through the Northeast with unprecedented force. I still remember the harried calls to loved ones, the anxious waiting to hear from friends in harms way, and the heartbreak for those who lost so much. More than 159 Americans died in the storm, and 72,000 homes and businesses were damaged in New Jersey alone. The official price tag topped $65 billion, but people's drained nest eggs and lost business may never be fully accounted for -- or recovered.Still, this is a resilient place, and many neighborhoods have rebounded and many leaders are trying to prepare our region for the next superstorm. This work is critical: Climate change has made us vulnerable to higher storm surges, more frequent flooding, and other extreme events. We have to brace for this new reality, and NRDC recently outlined 10 steps to help get the job done.Yet some leaders in Washington want to stand in the way of this work.  Coal industry lobbyists and House Republicans have chosen to spend the anniversary of Superstorm Sandy trying to block climate action and help the polluters who release the largest amount of global warming pollution in our nation.Cleaning up after Superstorm Sandy in Long Beach, New York. Photo: FEMAGOP lawmakers have planned two hearings today to claim the coal industry shouldn't be required to clean up its act. One hearing hosted by the House Science, Space and Technology Committee is expected to say the coal industry can't innovate fast enough to reduce dangerous carbon pollution from power plants. We heard the same arguments from the auto industry over getting lead out of gasoline, from the chemical industry over phasing out CFCs, and from the utility industry over reducing acid rain. In each instance, American ingenuity came through and found cost-effective ways to reduce pollution. But some in the coal industry don't want to be called on to modernize.The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will host the second coal friendly hearing of the day on how carbon pollution standards would affect coal mining communities. The chairman of the subcommittee, Representative Tim Murphy (R-PA), is the same lawmaker who tried to prevent the government from including the benefits of climate action in cost benefit/analyses. In other words, when the agencies run the numbers for carbon standards, it would not be able to account for the savings from avoided medical costs or prevented property damage, if Murphy had his way.Saying we shouldn't calculate the benefits of addressing climate change is just another form of climate denial. And it is just one more form of obstruction.Many of their proposed measures attack the Environmental Protection Agency head on. Representative Ed Whitfield (R-KY), and Senator Joe Manchin (D-WVA) unveiled details of new bills on Monday that roll back proposed carbon standards for new power plants, block the EPA from setting standards for new coal plants that are any better than current uncontrolled levels, and force the EPA to get approval from Congress for any carbon limits for existing coal plants. This would rob the EPA of its ability to protect people and turn it instead into a rubber stamp for the coal industry.While House GOP lawmakers have been putting polluters first, other leaders have been standing up for people. Today Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ) is holding a press conference featuring people impacted by Superstorm Sandy and calling for climate action. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo have spoken forcefully about the need to adapt to an altered climate. President Obama has released a bold climate plan and directed the EPA to set limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants. And just yesterday, the governments of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia signed the new Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy to reduce carbon pollution and promote low carbon energy resources.This is the kind of leadership we need right now. Superstorm Sandy offered a vivid illustration of what extreme weather can do to our homes and neighborhoods. If we act now, we can help shield our families from the worst of unchecked climate change. We can build strong, resilient communities, and we can curb dangerous pollution. And we can honor those who suffered last year's superstorm by creating a more sustainable future for our city, our region, and our country."}, {"title": "National Cat Day 2013: It's Time To Celebrate Our Feline Pals (SUBMIT YOUR OWN PHOTOS)", "text": "Happy National Cat Day!Every October 29, cat-lovers join together to celebrate our feline pals and encourage their adoption.

Do Republicans Care?", "text": "Ted Cruz always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Jason Zengerle wrote in GQ that the senator from Texas \"has come to the reluctant but unavoidable conclusion that he is simply more intelligent, more principled, more right -- in both senses of the word -- than pretty much everyone else in our nation's capital.\" A roommate from Harvard Law School said Cruz announced he'd only study with students who'd graduated from Harvard, Yale or (like he did) Princeton.New Jersey's Gov. Chris Christie graduated from the University of Delaware, and got his law degree at Seton Hall. I'll bet Christie thinks he's pretty smart too, whatever Sen. Cruz thinks of his pedigree. In recent days we've seen these two men, two of the leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, take diametrically opposed paths in doing their respective jobs.Earlier in the week, Christie threw in the towel in his fight against marriage equality in New Jersey. The State Supreme Court had issued a unanimous ruling that allowed same-sex marriages to go forward while waiting to hear the Christie administration's appeal, and stated therein that the appeal had little \"reasonable probability of success.\" Christie then decided to drop the appeal (one aide called it a \"fool's errand\"), and the fight was over.Let's compare how Christie handled this matter to the Ted Cruz-led strategy carried out by tea party Republicans in Congress, a strategy that led to a two-week long government shutdown, threatened to force a default on our national debt obligations, and which cost our country, according to Standard & Poor's, about $24 billion. Remember, the goal of the shutdown and the default threat was to blackmail President Obama into defunding his signature legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).No one outside the right-wing echo chamber thought that strategy offered a \"reasonable probability of success.\" One Republican senator called it \"the dumbest idea I've ever heard.\" Did that convince Cruz it was a \"fool's errand\"? An internal memo produced by Cruz's Senate office after the government reopened provides your answer:\"The defund plan produced tangible results that create both immediate and long-term benefits for the country and the conservative cause.\"That must be some echo chamber.If I really had a good sense of humor, I'd come up with a way to throw in Mr. T's famous \"I pity the fool\" line here in reference to Sen. Cruz. C'est la vie. But seriously, comparing their tactics makes clear that, in the words of Aaron Blake at the Washington Post, Gov. Christie represents the \"anti-Ted Cruz.\"Whereas Cruz's policy makes no sense to anyone left of Rush Limbaugh, Christie in 2016 can easily defend his stance along the lines of something like this:I strongly oppose gay marriage. I fought it in a state where it has widespread support. I vetoed it when the legislature passed it, but then those activist judges took it upon themselves to make law. I never wavered in my opposition to it, but at least - unlike some of my Republican friends in Washington -- I know how to read the writing on the wall when it's obvious my view can't carry the day. One thing I won't do is engage in pointless, self-destructive actions that make a lot of noise but don't accomplish anything or, as with shutting down the government and threatening to default on our debt, actually cost our country billions. I'm a conservative, but I'm also a smart, realistic one. We can't afford to nominate a Don Quixote conservative for President.Chris Christie definitely has some problems he must to deal with if he wants to win the Republican nomination for president in three years, let alone actually get to the White House. Even his image as a doer who took care of his state's hardest hit after Hurricane Sandy has been damaged now that people are actually examining the record.On the environment, his conservatism comes through loud and clear, as he removed New Jersey from the interstate Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. His state is also the only significant absence along the coastal drive from Boston to Washington, D.C., (no offense, Delaware) from a new bi-coastal compact -- California and Oregon also signed on -- aimed at making it more convenient to drive an electric car.The radicalism of the tea party, however, only enhances the ability of someone like Christie to do exactly what John McCain and Mitt Romney did, win the nomination as the most \"reasonable\" conservative in the party. Christie this week showed that -- while his beliefs remain conservative across the board (i.e., he's no Jon Huntsman or Rudy Giuliani) -- he has in fact learned a thing or two from Kenny Rogers about how to play poker.Christie should be more likely to win the Republican nomination than Ted Cruz, or any other tea party-linked right-winger such as Rand Paul. Certainly, he's a far stronger general election candidate as well. We'll find out if Republican primary voters follow their heads or their hearts.In the end, a Chris Christie presidency might not be as destructive to our country as, heaven forfend, a President Ted Cruz would be, but that's an awfully low bar to clear. I might prefer having a pigeon defecate on my head once a day rather than every five minutes, but thankfully those won't be our only two options."}, {"title": "One Year Later, Hurricane Sandy From Those Who Fixed It", "text": "The Greatest Generation built America's modern infrastructure, but Americans now have a choice to make. Will we be caretakers of the hard work of past generations who built our transportation, communications, water and energy transmission systems? Or will we squander it?It's looking more and more like the latter, unless we make a U-turn now.One year ago, Superstorm Sandy demonstrated just how vulnerable our infrastructure is to increasingly severe weather. Subway tunnels flooded. Cell phone towers were knocked out. The electrical grid was incapacitated. Hospitals lost their stand-by power systems. Schools couldn't serve as effective community shelters. Roads and bridges were washed out. The effects of climate change we are already experiencing demands that we assess our infrastructure and redesign and repair every bit of it that is found wanting. Our safety requires it. And our economy can't afford to do without it.Utility workers were on the front lines after 8.5 million customers lost power in seven states. These men and women left their own families to work 12-16 hour shifts repairing and rebuilding the electrical grid, and they have a lot to say about what needs to be done moving forward.Valerie King from Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) Local 601 in New Jersey said of infrastructure issues during the storm, \"A lot of the poles were weak, they snapped like sticks and there were a lot of downed wires. It took too much time to get people back into their homes. Some people were without power for two weeks. It was unconscionable.\"James Slevin from UWUA Local 1-2 in New York said, \"Companies have slacked off on what they are supposed to do. Even though there are a lot of private entities out there, they service the public. We need upgrades. We can no longer have an 'I'll repair it when it breaks' system.\"The American Society of Civil Engineers' (ASCE) report card illustrates that the basic systems we rely on every day really are in bad of shape. The overall state of our infrastructure was a D+. ASCE cited severe shortfalls in drinking water systems, wastewater management, bridges, roads, energy transmission and much more.If we don't make this a teachable moment, I'm afraid the worst is yet to come. America's infrastructure is antiquated and reliant on patch job repairs. America's infrastructure has always been the backbone on which our economy ran -- getting power where it was needed, moving goods and people from one point to another, allowing us to communicate rapidly. In the great race for a more competitive American economy, our future rests on having a solid foundation. Our children play with iPads while the gas that heats our homes runs through aging pipes.Luckily, there's still time to turn it around, and the benefits of repairing America's deteriorating systems are huge. Investments in infrastructure ripple throughout the economy. For example, every $1 billion invested in our water or wastewater systems creates approximately 27,000 jobs. While the amount needed to repair our systems may seem daunting, the cost of inaction is even greater. A recent Department of Energy study calculated that 144 extreme weather events since 1980 had cost the U.S. economy over $1 trillion. And the frequency of these \"billion dollar storms\" is accelerating. Seven of the ten worst storms happened between 2004 and 2012.Instead of spending a trillion dollars rescuing Americans after the fact, wouldn't we be better off repairing America before the fact?Making roads and bridges, electrical grid and transit systems much better than they are today will put people back to work in good, American jobs and it will help protect our communities and the environment. The solution is within our grasp. Let's make it happen."}, {"title": "The Importance of Remembering Superstorm Sandy", "text": "Last year, I watched in horror as Superstorm Sandy approached the East Coast. Having lived through the category 5 Hurricane Andrew in South Florida, I knew firsthand the devastation that a massive hurricane can unleash. I knew the fear that so many were experiencing and felt the pain that the storm would leave in its wake. Just as we had once returned to find only vague remnants of our homes, I knew they too would face the same shock that we had lived.Sadly, Superstorm Sandy lived up to its name. At least 150 people died in the U.S. but the toll on millions of others goes beyond. The storm's winds combined with incoming tides to flood low-lying areas of Manhattan including subways and tunnels. Millions were without power for days, hospitals were evacuated, and the famed boardwalks along New Jersey's coastline were destroyed along with hundreds of businesses and countless numbers of homes.The National Climatic Data Center estimates the cost of damage caused by Sandy at $65 billion, second only to Hurricane Katrina on the list of costliest disasters ever to hit the United States. And while some can and are rebuilding, others stand no chance of rebuilding since their land was washed out to sea.In the wake of Sandy, we are forced to acknowledge the new reality that our climate is changing. Climate disruption is already changing precipitation patterns, causing sea levels to rise, and increasing the possibility of weather extremes, which means that extreme weather events are likely to be more frequent or severe than they were in the past. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo put it well: \"Anyone who says that there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality,\" Cuomo said. \"We have a 100-year flood every two years now.\"Higher sea levels have also increased the risk of flooding. Sea levels from Boston to Norfolk, Virginia are rising four times as fast as the global average, making the region vulnerable to flooding and dangerous storm surges. A September report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found flooding was made worse by rising sea levels brought on by climate change and predicted that similar flooding could occur in Lower Manhattan and Sandy Hook in New Jersey every 20-50 years.The people who survived Superstorm Sandy have reminded us that we are resilient, but why risk life and limb simply because we refuse to take action to limit the carbon pollution that is the main reason our climate is changing? We can cut carbon pollution by using energy more efficiently, cleaning up our power plants and increasing our use of renewable energy.Climate change threatens us all. For low-income and minority communities, the impacts of climate change are even more serious. Millions of Latinos live in areas that fail to meet air quality standards and Latino and African-American communities are often subjected to industrial pollution first hand, living next to coal-fired power plants. When it comes to extreme weather events driven by climate change including heat waves, powerful storms, drought, and wildfires, these communities often are on the front lines.Emergency response and evacuation efforts during Sandy proved challenging for communities with limited English proficiency, and post-Sandy recovery resources were often hard to come by for uninsured, undocumented and disenfranchised communities. After the storm, doctors in the Voces Verdes network who work with these communities reported a surge in asthma attacks among patients, as well as other respiratory illnesses which can be especially serious for those with asthma or other chronic respiratory illnesses. For families already struggling to get by these challenges can be devastating.Sandy presented us with an opportunity to gauge our ability to protect our communities and exposed far too many holes. We must compel our leaders to act by taking action to fight climate change and build needed infrastructure to better protect communities recognizing that a one-size fits all approach may not always work for the most vulnerable.NRDC has released a list of the top 10 ways our government leaders can take action to make us safer in the post-Sandy world by rebuilding intelligently, ensuring future development recognizes the need to naturally reduce flood risk, protecting critical infrastructure like power plants, water treatment plants, hospitals, and transportation systems, all while we work to address the root causes of climate change. We must start there, by solving the root cause. We owe it to those who have already suffered so much and have a duty to protect future generations from a similar fate."}, {"title": "It's An Elephant Pumpkin Smash!", "text": "Watch baby Lily experience her first Halloween season in a big way when Oregon Zoo gave the Asian elephant herd some pumpkins to play with, including a 1,300-pound squash!That is way more than the mere 300 pounds Lily weighed at birth!

But the Environmental Protection Agency disputed that, saying higher rail costs could limit growth.Canada's crude-by-rail sector has grown since that review, with five new loading terminals in western Canada expected to move as much as 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude by the end of 2014, relieving a glut of oil in the region and seeming to prove the strength of crude-by-rail.Yet even rail operators caution that moving the fuel on the tracks would be only a supplement - not a substitute - for TransCanada Corp's Keystone pipeline.Apart from the logistics, rail remains the costlier option - a point that environmentalists could seize on as the final decision on Keystone draws nearer. The extra dollars spent on shipping could slow investment in some of Canada's higher-cost projects, analysts say.\"We can move large volumes, but it will always be a niche service,\" said Gary Kubera, whose company, Canexus, expects to be equipped to move 100,000 bpd by the end of next year.A State Department spokesman declined to comment on details of the Keystone review, saying officials want input from stakeholders, scientists, engineers \"and others with expertise in key areas of concern related to the proposed project.\"The State Department and the EPA - which also has a say in the Keystone review - have said they are wrestling with whether approving Keystone would spur greater development of Canada's oil sands - and worsen climate change by stoking greenhouse gas emissions. Extracting crude from oil sands requires a huge exertion of energy.If the State Department softens its oil-by-rail findings, Keystone foes might have more ammunition to block a project they say will greatly increase greenhouse gas emissions. A final decision is due next spring.INDUSTRY INSIGHTIn the past several months administration officials have heard from crude-by-rail operators that expect to profit as they connect oil sands producers with distant refiners. Some are now building terminals that were barely contemplated a year ago.\"We offer producers another transport option apart from pipelines,\" said Jarrett Zielinski, president of Torq Transloading, which is already shipping some 35,000 barrels of heavy crude a day and is planning to expand.Five loading docks for heavy crude are now being built in western Canada under a number of partnerships between energy and rail companies and should be positioned to move a share of that crude overstock in the years to come, executives say.\"We remain very, very confident that rail is here to stay as not a replacement for pipelines, but as a supplement to pipelines,\" Stew Hanlon, president of Gibson Energy Inc., a logistics company, told investors in August about a Canadian loading project.The energy sector longs for pipelines that can provide cheap, reliable links to heavy crude refineries in Texas and Louisiana. RBC Capital Markets estimated that up to 450,000 barrels per day of oil sands projects could be delayed without Keystone XL.It takes roughly $17 to send a barrel of heavy crude to the Gulf Coast via rail compared with roughly $10 in a pipeline, industry sources said, and there is a shortage of terminals that can accept the heavy crude.Starting next year, crude pipelines will be so congested that rail will become a vital tool for relieving the glut, according to a Goldman Sachs report on the sector.AGENCY REVIEWThe State Department has not yet reached a final conclusion on Keystone's climate impacts, several industry sources said, but that work should be finished in the coming weeks.Once the State Department review is completed, foes and supporters of the pipeline are likely to begin a fresh lobbying blitz. And administration officials have said they will be open for more public comment on a project that has been in limbo since 2008.Regardless of whether Keystone is approved, industry officials say even more pipelines will be needed to keep oil sands production meeting industry expectations.\"Crude-by-rail is the safety net,\" said David Smith, president of Canadian logistics company Keyera, which is behind two crude-by-rail projects.

She drowned after being pulled into a pool by Tilikum, a 12,000-pound bull orca, at SeaWorld's site in Orlando, Florida.In August 2010, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined SeaWorld $75,000 for three safety violations, saying it had exposed its trainers to a hazardous environment and violated a part of the Occupational Safety and Health Act known as the general duty clause.OSHA, a part of the Labor Department, demanded SeaWorld make certain changes, notably, physically separating the killer whale trainers from the orcas during show performances.SeaWorld is appealing the broad application of a federal safety law meant to protect workers in unusual circumstances. The case will come before a three-judge panel of the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Nov. 12.With animal rights activists watching, Eugene Scalia, son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, will represent SeaWorld in its fight against a federal order that sharply criticized the marine park operator's safety measures.Ken Welsch, an administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, in 2012 upheld the OSHA citations but downgraded one of them to \"serious\" from \"willful,\" effectively reducing the fine to $12,000 from $75,000.In appealing Welsch's decision, SeaWorld argued OSHA's fine was premised on an overly broad view and \"novel application\" of the general duty clause, which mandates that employers keep their workplaces free from \"recognized\" hazards. In a 60-page opening appellate brief, SeaWorld called the case \"fundamentally misguided.\"\"The clause cannot be used to force a company to change the very product that it offers the public, and the business it is in,\" SeaWorld wrote. \"The clause is no more an instrument for supervising the interactions between whales and humans at SeaWorld, than it is a charter to prohibit blocking and tackling in the NFL or to post speed limits on the NASCAR circuit.\"BLACKSTONE FLOATED SEAWORLDSeaWorld Orlando is owned by SeaWorld Entertainment , which was taken public in April by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP. SeaWorld shares closed up 1.1 percent on Monday at $30.33 each in mildly bullish trading.SeaWorld has brought in a high-powered team from law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to press its appeal. The team includes Scalia, formerly the Labor Department's top lawyer. He is joined by Baruch Fellner, also a former Labor Department lawyer, who founded Gibson Dunn's OSHA practice.The general duty clause is OSHA's \"catch-all\" clause that it wields against companies in situations where there is not necessarily a dominant, clearly articulated safety standard, said Melissa Bailey, an attorney at Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart who represents employers in OSHA cases.The cases can be difficult to pursue because OSHA must show what is a \"recognized\" hazard when there are not clear industry standards, she said.\"In cases like the SeaWorld case, that's a unique animal - no pun intended,\" said Bailey.ORCAS AND PEOPLEThe penalties OSHA can bring are relatively small, but a key issue is at stake for SeaWorld - whether its performances can include killer whales and humans in close contact.\"OSHA penalties are not that great,\" said Bailey, comparing them to fines that other agencies can levy. \"But it's rarely the fine that drives the litigation. It's often the abatement cost, and having this on your record.\"SeaWorld trainers have not been in the water with an orca since the drowning, said SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs.SeaWorld's primary concern in the litigation is the long-term effect that OSHA's requirement of separation of humans and killer whales could have on the shows. In court papers SeaWorld called their interaction \"integral to its mission.\"\"We want to continue to display these animals in a way that assures their health and well-being and is safe for our zoological staff,\" Jacobs said in an email. He declined to comment further, citing the pending litigation.Human-orca interaction has long been filled with controversy, revisited earlier this year with the release of the movie \"Blackfish\" about Brancheau's death and Tilikum's 30-year career as an entertainer and stud for other captive whales. SeaWorld has criticized the film as \"inaccurate and misleading.\"The Labor Department says SeaWorld knew that close human-orca contact was dangerous - Tilikum has been involved in other human deaths - and it routinely took steps to minimize hazards.\"The Secretary (of Labor) did not overreach in applying the general duty clause to SeaWorld in this case because the clause is meant to address unusual hazards for which there are no promulgated standards, just like the hazard present here,\" the Labor Department wrote in a brief.Two animal-rights groups - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Animal Legal Defense Fund - have weighed in with an amicus brief to support the Labor Department. The groups, strong critics of SeaWorld in the past, wrote in the brief that prolonged captivity has forced the orcas to behave aggressively.The case is SeaWorld of Florida v. Thomas E. Perez, No. 12-1375, U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.For U.S. Department of Labor: M.

Little remained of the one-story house that he had spent countless hours renovating himself. There was the concrete foundation, a purple tricycle lying on its back on the bottom of the in-ground swimming pool, and a tire swing still hanging from a tree.All around, feathery blades of marsh grass rustled in the wind. For years, Correa and his neighbors had waged war with those weeds, cutting them back to keep their houses safe from wildfires. Now Correa sort of misses them. \"To be honest, when I come here and I'm listening to what I'm listening to now, I still imagine living here,\" he said. \"I love it here.\"A year after Sandy, a swimming pool is among the only remains of Pedro Correa's home.Correa acknowledged he's among \"the lucky ones.\" He and the other residents of Staten Island's Oakwood Beach neighborhood recently learned that New York state plans to buy their homes at pre-storm prices, allowing the neighborhood to revert to marshland. In Midland Beach, New Dorp Beach and other Staten Island neighborhoods along the water's edge, people are still paying mortgages on uninhabitable homes.The state has bought just 400 of the thousands of homes that the storm ruined. State officials told The Associated Press they selected Oakwood Beach for a mass buyout in part because residents began pushing for that solution immediately after the storm. \"There's a happy ending to our story,\" Correa said. \"But not everyone is going to get a happy ending.\"A year ago, Correa didn't predict that his story would have a happy ending -- or even a bittersweet one. \"I just don't see it ending in any way except bankruptcy,\" he told The Huffington Post a few weeks after the storm.In an in-depth article last year, The Huffington Post chronicled Correa's harrowing encounter with the sea on the night of the storm, and his family's efforts to restore their lives in the aftermath. On the evening of Oct. 29, Correa and a friend ignored city evacuation orders so they could set up an electric pump in the basement of Correa's house. By the time they realized the storm was going to be the worst they'd ever seen, Correa's car was floating down the street. Correa rode out the storm on the roof of a neighbor's house that had been torn loose by the ocean's surge.The wave had ripped 13 of the block's 17 homes off their foundations. By the next day, at least 23 people had died on Staten Island, more than half of New York City's total fatalities in the storm.Like many in New York City's most conservative borough, Correa had little faith in the government's ability to help people recover. But on Monday, he acknowledged that Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Democratic administration had defied his expectations by offering people in Oakwood Beach a fair price for their homes. \"Government doesn't always work, and I had a hard time believing it would work here,\" he said. \"But Gov. Cuomo really came through.\"Correa and his family never had to file for bankruptcy.Last year, The Huffington Post spoke with Staten Island residents, political operatives, and academics who argued that the borough's small-government ethos contributed to the storm's destruction. For years, residents of Oakwood Beach had petitioned the federal government to build a wall and other flood barriers, while electing politicians who promised a smaller government and lower taxes. In 2000, the Army Corps of Engineers began investigating the possibility of building a wall to shield Staten Island's most vulnerable neighborhoods from the sort of flooding caused by Sandy. But the study ran out of funding and stalled after a few years.Work on the study resumed in 2008, but the results still haven't been released. \"At what point in time does it become a priority to manage this problem?\" said Jonathan Peters, an economist who specializes in local issues at the College of Staten Island, on Monday. \"We're sitting here today basically having the same conversation we would have had a year ago, in terms of what's in place to make the community safer. The only thing that makes it safer is that some people have left.\"Correa and his wife and two children left for a rental apartment further inland. \"We've made it comfortable,\" he said. \"But I say I'm 'staying' there, not 'living' there.\" He and his wife hope to buy a new home soon.It won't be the same, he acknowledged. \"This was my baby,\" he said, standing on the concrete slab where his home used to be. \"This was my life's work.\" But there was a drawback to spending every vacation and weekend working on the dream house that he nearly died trying to save. \"That was time I didn't spend with my family,\" he said. \"I don't want my legacy to be a house. I want it to be that I'm a father.\"CORRECTION: The original article misidentified New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo as his father, Mario Cuomo."}, {"title": "Illinois' Teachable Moment: The True Cost of Coal, Slavery and Historical Markers", "text": "As another coal train derailed in southern Illinois last weekend, the Illinois State Historical Society teamed up with the Illinois Coal Association on Saturday for their own collision with history during the installation of a historical marker for the state's \"First Coal Mine.\"  The real train wreck: Among numerous errors, the Illinois State Historical Society marker fails to mention that other coal mines abounded in southern Illinois, thanks to enslaved African American labor -- including the so-called \"first coal mine\" -- while the Illinois Coal Association took the occasion to erroneously bash \"environmental regulations\" for mining job losses, as the Prairie State plunges head-long into a new coal rush and a reckless environmental and health disaster.What gives, Illinois State Historical Society? Doesn't history matter -- at least over the hackneyed phrases of the Big Coal lobby, even if they provided most of the funds for the historical marker?While our nation now recognizes that \"Black History Month\" emerged from historian Carter Woodson's \"six-year apprenticeship\" in the West Virginia coal mines, isn't it time for the Illinois State History Society to stop finding excuses in the Land of Lincoln -- and Obama -- and finally come clean on the secret legacy of slavery in our coal mines and salt wells, if only to remind us of cautionary tales for our own times?Two weeks ago, in fact, the state of Illinois pulled the plug on its coal education website for kids, due to public outrage over inaccuracies and an air-brushed version of the industry's wreckage.Here's the teachable moment for the Illinois State Historical Society: It's time to recognize that African American coal miners, enslaved and indentured, launched the Illinois coal industry -- including the so-called \"first coal mine\" in 1810 -- and when the state of Illinois ratified its constitution in 1818, a largely overlooked loophole allowed for legal slavery in the crucial tax-revenue-generating salt works, generated by coal mines, in the out-of-sight Shawnee Forests of southern Illinois.In essence: Backroom compromises by legislators, due to needs for tax revenues, trumped the inalienable human rights of American citizens. Sound familiar?Outrageously as it seems, the Illinois historical marker for the notorious salt wells even fails to mention the role of slaves or African Americans, as well.Illinois, goddam.When are we going to recognize our African American legacy, as well as the courageous efforts of anti-slavery activists, led by backwoods Baptists near the salt works and coal mines in southern Illinois, to wrest the emancipation-invoking hypocritical state leaders from their profitable connections to salt and coalfield slavery?Such a connection became clear to me a decade ago, when my family's 150-year-old homestead in the Eagle Creek area of southern Illinois, near the historic salt works and coal mines, was stripmined into oblivion. A fairly large slave cemetery on the edge of our historic property disappeared with it.When a Chicago Tribune reporter appeared at the home of one of the last remaining residents in 2002, a new chapter in Illinois history was finally revealed. One of the last hold-outs in the area agreed to lease part of his ridge to a coal company, though he first issued a warning.\"All my life I've been told there's a Negro cemetery out there,\" the old timer told the Tribune reporter. \"Them people's got a soul, just like you and me.\"Walking with the elderly farmer to the hillside, where a clearing gave way to sandstone blocks and shallow grave depressions, the Tribune reporter hailed it the oldest African American cemetery in Illinois. The graves were attributed to the nearby salt wells and coal mines. But the survey of an archaeological firm hired by the out-of-state coal company, Illinois Fuel, considered the graves a \"local legend.\" The site was deemed ineligible for historic preservation status. Nor had it been registered with the Illinois Comptroller's office under the Cemetery Care Act -- therefore, the coal operators were free to bulldoze the site.Perhaps because the Tribune article had been picked up newspapers across the country, the coal company decided against the interpretation of the archaeologists and refused to strip mine the hillside.But the real story did not appear in the Tribune article. Accompanying the reporter, a local writer had asked the farmer about the origins of the black community in Eagle Creek, and their larger burial grounds. The farmer pointed down the hill: \"Across from the old Bethel Church,\" he said, pointing to the same fields that had adjoined my family's and a legendary slave-owning businessman's property in Eagle Creek.The Illinois Coal Industry Rose on the Backs of SlavesThomas Jefferson's Old Dominion dipped into its coal pits a half century before the American Revolution with African-gripped picks and shovels. As early as 1765, ads in the New York Mercury newspaper appeared for coal sales from slave-operated mines in Chesterfield County in Virginia. Still, in 1770, the American colonies relied on and imported thousands of tons of coal from Britain.By the time retreating Hessian solders in the American Revolution forces noted in their 1780 diaries of their astonishment of black slaves laboring in the trenches of coal pits, our emerging nation's first coal industry was in full swing. When French aristocrat the duke de La Rochefoucauld visited the Dover Pit coal mine near Richmond in 1796, en route to Jefferson's home, slave labor had become a key component in Virginia's coal trade. The Frenchman counted more than 500 black slaves toiling in a single underground mine. The primitive conditions of the mines horrified him. Despite the incredible dangers, including frequent cave-ins, methane gas explosions and fires, and flooding, the slaves had no choice. Anyone who refused to work was whipped. The death toll in these mines was unfathomable.In the spring of 1838, more than 40 black slaves and their two foremen were buried alive 700 feet below the earth, when an explosion devastated the Black Heath coal pit in Virginia. At the Dover Pits in Virginia in 1837, one visitor noted that slaves literally worked as mules to transport the coal to the main entry. He wrote: \"Each man has a chain fastened by straps around his breast, which he hooks to the corve, and thus harnessed, and in a stooping posture, he drags his heavy load over the floor of rock.\"In truth, black slaves had arrived in the coal mines in the Illinois Country nearly half a century before their counterparts dug the first pits in Virginia. During the Shawnee period, hundreds of black slaves from the French-controlled Caribbean floated up the Mississippi River and disembarked on the Illinois shores at Fort Chartres in 1722. Sanctioned by the French Crown, mining engineer Phillipe Renault arrived with the ruthless aims of the Company of the Indies to extract as much of the mineral wealth as possible in the new territory.The anti-slavery clause in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 notwithstanding, by the time famed explorers Lewis and Clark observed blacksmiths and gunsmiths employing coal in their work along the riverbeds in southern Illinois in 1803, slavery had become an entrenched part of the trading economy in the region. Slave-owning settlers simply interpreted the law to be applicable to new immigrants; the French, as well as the pioneering Americans, kept their slaves or servants, and actually paid taxes on them.In 1803, however, this policy changed in language, but not practice. As part of the Indiana Territory, residents in Illinois could engage in \"voluntary\" indenture contracts. Voluntary was an illusory term, of course. Residents were allowed to travel across the Ohio River and into slave states, such as Kentucky and Tennessee, return with a slave, who was then offered an indentured contract of typically 30 to 50 years -- many \"voluntary\" indenture contracts were drawn up to 99 years -- or be sold back into slavery on the other side of the river. Young slaves fared even worse; those under 15 were automatically indentured for 20 years, whereupon they could \"voluntarily\" indenture themselves for the rest of their lives. In the meantime, the masters were allowed to sell and trade their servants like property; most servants simply lived out the rest of their lives with the inheritors of their contracts.Despite the laws, the entry and purchasing of slaves continued for decades.In 1803, a slave-owning Kentucky salt operator earned the first lease from the government to produce 120,000 bushels of salt in the wells near Eagle Creek. He didn't last long. Over the next few years, a series of lessees would take control of the wells, increasing the ranks of slaves. The Illinois Territory adopted the indenture laws of Indiana, which had been updated over the course of six years, when it was established in 1809. The slave owners, in fact, demanded more. No one, more so, than the salt well operators near Eagle Creek.If anything, history has immortalized the act of slavery in name alone: The Great Salt Spring near Eagle Creek dots historical maps as N----r Well or N----r Furnace. It still remains the Negro Spring today. A second spring, Half Moon Lick, was located closer to the town of Equality. By 1810, an estimated 1,000 black slaves had toiled in the forested area as woodcutters and salt kettle attendants. Some had been temporarily brought over from Kentucky and Tennessee.On the western side of southern Illinois, an enslaved African American named Peter Boon -- according to most historical references and documents, such as the Jackson County Historical Society's publication, \"Jackson County, Illinois: Formation and Early Settlement\" -- shoveled and loaded the outcroppings of coal along the south bank of the Big Muddy River in Jackson County, Illinois in 1810. Pushing off toward the Mississippi River in their flatboat, William Boon, a captain in the mounted rangers, and his slave Peter transported the first commercial barge of coal in the heartland.This is the so-called \"first coal mine\" that the Illinois State Historical Society marker celebrates.The slave registers for Jackson County were lost in the historic fire of 1843, but William Boon's presence as a slave owner is noted in subsequent Census data, and virtually every history book recognizes his role as Peter's slave owner. William Boon also purchased a \"voluntarily indentured\" servant as late as 1822. In 1836, Boon's son Ben took a historic case to the Illinois Supreme Court over the status of inherited children of slaves, including a younger Peter.As a former lead miner from Kentucky and Missouri, Boon engineered the first commercial slope mine in Illinois. He and his slave embarked on several epic voyages down the Mississippi to New Orleans, where they were paid in European currency for coal and loads of forest and farm products.Boon's efforts attracted attention. As the first state legislator from southwestern Illinois, he also played a role in shaping the laws that allowed for slave labor to assist his work. He would also set the precedent for the entrepreneurial coal foundations in government office -- effectively, the first coal lobby in cahoots with the statewide government.But Boon's coal mine was not the first in Illinois. In 1797, Morse's American Gazetteer noted: \"On the north-western side of this river (near La Salle) is a coal mine, which extends for half a mile along the middle of its banks.\"More importantly, coal mines with the commercially contracted salt works had been operating since 1806, given the rapid deforestation around the salt wells. Albert Gallatin, the Swiss-born secretary of the Treasury, had already envisioned the use of coal as part of a national system of roads and canals development. In 1809, he instructed the governor of Illinois to introduce conditions to \"effectually prevent the waste of timber, and to encourage the use of coal\" at the salt furnaces, to which lessees would pay less rent.In 1812, however, two developments took place that would accelerate the demand for coal. With the strain of the war with Britain, the federal government altered its original intent of leasing out the salt wells -- to provide cheap salt to as many people as possible. In need of revenue, the government allowed the salt operators to nearly double their rates, resulting in more rent revenues.Two years later, surveyors found the reservation possessed great quantities of coal, \"which may be transmitted to the works by water, or the water may be conveyed by pipes to the coal banks.\" To accommodate the labor demands of the salt operators, the Illinois territorial government passed a law in 1814 that allowed slaves to be imported from outside the state for one-year contracts.As William Boon's son Ben noted in his memoir, this also included the salt works near Boon's coal mines.The legislators declared that the lucrative salt trade \"could not be successfully carried on by white laborers.\" A year earlier, Illinois had also become the only free state or territory to deny the entry of free black immigrants. The Kentucky border, of course, was less than 15 miles away at the riverside. The slaves could literally gather at the river, touch their toes to the water, and be returned to the coal-stoked furnaces within an hour.To the dismay of emancipationists around the country, Illinois ratified its state constitution in 1818 with two jarring clauses. No slavery or involuntary servitude would be allowed -- though, unlike Indiana's constitution, previously enslaved and indentured servants remained in their same status.More important, the constitution had one exception: Legal slavery would be allowed \"within the tract reserved for the salt works near Shawneetown\" until 1825 -- the heart of the salt and coal fields near Eagle Creek. Those same salt works employed the same slaves to dig out the coal for the furnaces.Even more troubling, of course, was the fact that U.S. Congress accepted this constitution with its slave-owning loophole.A year later in 1819, the Illinois legislature passed the Black Codes, which called \"for whipping lazy blacks or mulattoes who are servants or slaves,\" and stipulated that \"blacks and mulattoes found without certificates of freedom could be arrested, advertised and sold.\"In 1824, the eyes of the nation shifted to Illinois, when the salt and coal traders engineered a scheme to call for a new constitutional convention. As George Flower, an English settler in southern Illinois explained, the state was being challenged to take slavery out of the closet and openly recognize and guarantee its role in Illinois' future:\"The lessees of the salines -- Granger [Crenshaw's other name, which had been used on various slave records], and others . . . made a bold stroke to perpetuate their system of servile labor, not by asking for an extension of time for hiring hands to work the saline, but they sought so to change the constitution as to make the whole of Illinois a slave-state.\"When Illinois voters turned down the convention vote in the summer of 1824, a sigh of relief was released across the nation and in the American heartland. If Illinois had passed this convention vote, other states like Indiana would have easily followed.The unsung credit, according to southern Illinois historian Ron Nelson, went to the backwoods Baptists and their \"Friends of Humanity\" anti-slavery movement, which bravely confronted the slave-owning salt and coal traders in the forests of Eagle Creek.Stripmining Black HistoryMy ancestors homesteaded in the Eagle Creek valley near the salt works in 1805. It is all gone now -- our 150-year-old home place and farm was stripmined in 1998-99. As part of the so-called reclamation laws, the coal company replanted a type of unmanaged grass, which grew in clumps like weeds. Not a single tree was planted on our ancestral property, in one of the most diverse forests area in the nation.But not just the land and our family history was stripped from existence. Hundreds of the graves of black slaves from the salt works and earliest coal pits that the old-timers secretly knew about at Eagle Creek were churned into dust; the last voices of the slaves were buried with mining waste. Their silences remain unearthed.There is not a single historical marker for the role of African American slaves and laborers in these historic areas of Illinois.In 1865, the Pottsville Miners' Journal declared the coal trade in the Kanawha River Valley of West Virginia had been \"cursed and controlled by the slave masters who 'like the dog in the manger' have for fifty years denied it to enterprise, and knew not how to profit for its immense mineral wealth.\" That curse came to an end in the spring of 1865. When Union forces advanced into Confederate territory in Virginia, slaves climbed out of the coal pits at Dover in total desertion, and fled for Richmond, bringing this ignominious first chapter of the coal industry to an end.In Illinois, however, the denial of that curse remains.At least until the Illinois State Historical Society decides to break the silence, and install genuine historical markers of our state's true legacies.Jeff Biggers is the author of Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland (Nation Books)."}, {"title": "Canadian Pipeline Incidents Have Doubled In The Past Decade, According To CBC Report", "text": "Oct 28 (Reuters) - The rate of safety-related incidents on federally regulated pipelines in Canada doubled over the last decade, while the rate of reported spills and leaks was up threefold, according to an investigative report by Canada's national broadcaster.The total number of incidents, which included everything from spills to fires, swelled from 45 in 2000 to 142 in 2011, the CBC reported on Monday, citing data from the National Energy Board (NEB) obtained through access-to-information requests.That translated to a doubling from one incident for every 1,000 km (620 miles) of federally-regulated pipeline in 2000, to two in 2011.The CBC investigation also found that the rate of product reported releases - spills and leaks - rose threefold, from four releases for every 10,000 km in 2000, to 13 in 2011.The NEB regulates all pipelines that cross provincial or international borders, but does not monitor smaller pipelines that are only in a single province.The safety of shipping petroleum products via pipelines has become a hot topic in recent years, with companies like Enbridge Inc and TransCanada Corp developing major new projects to move crude from Canada's oil sands to markets in the United States and Asia.Opponents say a pipeline leak can cause catastrophic environmental damage and often cite a 2010 incident where an Enbridge pipeline carrying crude from Alberta ruptured, spilling huge amounts of oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan.But pipeline companies say their operations are safer than the alternative - moving oil and gas products by rail or truck.Indeed, the safety of rail has become a central issue in Canada since a runaway train hauling crude oil derailed and exploded in the town of Lac-Megantic, Quebec in July, killing 47 people. Earlier this month, another train hauling crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas derailed and caught fire in Alberta.A recent report by the Fraser Institute, a right-leaning think tank, found that pipelines are safer for workers and that the risk of spill incidents is slightly lower than with rail.The CBC investigation looked at documents on 1,047 pipeline safety incidents from Jan. 1, 2000, until late 2012. Companies regulated by the NEB must report safety issues like deaths or serious injuries, fires and explosions, spills over 1,500 liters and every gas leak.The NEB attributed the rise in incidents to heightened awareness among companies about reporting standards, according to the CBC. A spokesperson for the regulator was not immediately available for comment."}, {"title": "One Year Later -- Superstorm Sandy:  Climate Chaos, Kids, and Schools", "text": "It is the first anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, and it is also 12 years this month since the Healthy Schools Network began documenting the absence of environmental health protections for children in schools it by disasters. That was after the attacks of September 11, when New York City rushed to get schools near Ground Zero back online. National reports show how the environmental conditions of schools can significantly hurt or help kids' health and ability to learn.Now after too many disasters, we know that school buildings can be further compromised by weather and other disasters: see pictures of schools ravaged by tornadoes, snow and ice storms hurricanes, and threatened by wild fires.Post-9/11, here's what we found. There was enormous pressure to \"normalize\" life by reopening schools as quickly as possible. But no federal, state, or city agency assessed the dust-and-fume contaminated schools in Lower Manhattan to determine if they were remediated for safe reoccupancy by children. Adults had some protections: The National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health responded to teachers' complaints and reported new onset illnesses in 300 school personnel. Yet, despite knowing that children are more vulnerable to hazards than adults and are compelled by law to attend school, no agency tracked the health of some 3,000 kids attending Stuyvesant High School. Indeed, parents reported that many kids had the same symptoms as personnel. Now, we are seeing the repercussions.   In another episode in late 2001, several national groups saw a bizarre outbreak of rashes among school children. The federal Centers for Disease Control investigated and learned two things: children in 100 districts in 27 states were affected with a noncontagious rash and that local schools could refuse entry to federal public health investigators concerned about potential new kind of terrorism.And there was more. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans schools were left with mold infestations and playground soils contaminated with flood-borne toxics such as benzene, lead, and pesticides. A National Commission on Children and Disasters urged important efforts to keep children and their parents united and mental health trauma counseling; but there was no recommendation to check on chemical hazards. Again in the Gulf, after the BP Oil Spill, we found no federal or state agency issued public health advisories on protecting children from the chemicals, while the local media carried pictures of kids splashing in oil-slicked waters.There are two large issues here.First, while we appreciate the important research investments in children's environmental health by the federal agencies over the last 15 years, we wonder why the agencies are not applying what they know to protect children in schools and child care centers.And, second, knowing that states require kids to attend schools, and that school buildings can be knocked flat by severe storms, where are the guidelines and construction funds for improving the resiliency of our children's schools?School building climate mitigation and resiliency are not simple tasks. States and districts need technical information, training, and implementation grants. Just sealing up and \"weatherizing\" buildings damages Indoor Air Quality; reducing ventilation to save on energy also hurts Indoor Air; using more air conditioners can be expensive and, in the increasing number of high humidity areas, the A/C needs to be on year round and maintained so it doesn't spew mold spores; more insulation can be a good thing, but not if it comes with hazardous chemical off-gassing, and as long as the building (and the occupants) can still breathe. Being \"green\" is not enough. A school needs to be a healthy building for children, so they can stay in school and learn.On the federal front, congressional chaos has added nothing and taken away funds. The Education Department has no more grant funds for school emergency management planning. US EPA's Indoor Environments Division, the leading experts in school indoor environments, has been decimated by budget cuts. EPA's Office of Children's Health Protection has suffered as well, just as it launched a voluntary grant program to help state agencies address environmental health issues. And CDC slashed its school health, asthma, and lead prevention programs. Are kids' health and learning no longer important?Obviously, with the current focus on student testing and teacher evaluations, academic performance in schools is a priority. But how can we ask our children to learn, and our teachers to teach, in sick schools?We think the responsible agencies should be able to offer at least the same public health protections to school children as they offer to principals, teachers and staff. And we think that states and districts need the technical guidance and funds now to help adapt to climate change and make the facilities, which after all are often used as community shelters, safer and more resilient to chaotic weather.Here's a solution: Let's take the money lost in the recent shutdown and reinvest a similar amount in helping our children and their schools."}, {"title": "Protecting Circus Elephants", "text": "Circuses that use wild animals should be a thing of the past and I applaud any steps to alleviate the suffering of animals under the big top.So I was pleased to learn that the Los Angeles City Council took action to ban bullhooks and any devices designed to inflict pain for the purpose of training and controlling the behavior of elephants used in circuses. This action makes Los Angeles the largest city in the country to prohibit such inhumane treatment of elephants. It could also signal the end of elephants in circuses visiting Los Angeles.Bullhooks resemble fireplace pokers. With a long handle, sharp metal hook and spiked tip, the bullhook is designed to inflict pain, suffering and fear in elephants. In 2010, a judge ordered the Los Angeles Zoo to stop using bullhooks on its elephants. The Oakland Zoo was one of the first to pioneer the use of protected contact on elephants more than 20 years ago. Protected contact is now widely used as a training method that relies solely on positive reinforcement.This new legislation sheds light on just one inhumane activity practiced by circuses. Wild animals in a circus are kept in small cages. They are cared for by workers, who have little to no experience monitoring them for illnesses or injuries. Animals are routinely hit, poked, prodded and shocked so that they will perform on command. If they are too ill to perform, they often are forced to continue as the show must go on.In a statement praising the Los Angeles City Council, Jennifer Fearing, California senior state director for the Humane Society of the United States, said: \"Devices that cause pain and suffering have no place in the handling of captive elephants. We commend the Los Angeles City Council for taking steps to protect these highly intelligent and social animals from inhumane and outdated training methods.\"What message are we sending to our children if we take them to a circus featuring live wild animals? Observing tigers jumping through flaming hoops or watching elephants balancing on balls sends the wrong message as this is not behavior we would find in the wild. These animals do not perform because they want to, but because they are severely punished if they don't. Circuses play no role in animal conservation. They exist purely for entertainment and profit.Take your children to see Cirque du Soleil or other animal-free circuses instead of circuses that use wild animals. Let your city council know that you won't tolerate the mistreatment of animals in circuses and ask them to take steps to ban bullhooks and other similar devices that inflict pain and suffering to the animals. Legislation is the best means that we have to protect these animals from harm."}, {"title": "Colorado Flood Benefit Concert Raises Nearly $500K For Victims", "text": "Coloradans in need after the historic flooding that resulted in the deaths of nine people and over $2 billion in property damage got a big boost over the weekend when musicians raised nearly $500,000 for flood relief efforts with the \"Colorado Rising\" benefit concert.Featuring Dave Matthews, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, the Fray, members of the Lumineers, DeVotchKa and Nathaniel Rateliff, the show's proceeds went directly to the United Ways of Colorado Flood Recovery Fund.\u201cI\u2019m very honored to be with you all, making the noise,\u201d Matthews growled to the sold-out crowd Sunday at the 1STBANK Center in Broomfield. \u201cWhen we all get together, we can make a noise.

On the day of this unhappy anniversary, though, we can't really say the disaster is behind us. Thousands of families are still unable to return to their homes. Some people have lost everything, including the hope of getting it back.The destruction from Sandy wasn't even the only extreme-weather disaster during the past year. Colorado is still reeling from a triple whammy of drought, wildfires, and then unprecedented floods that forced thousands more to evacuate their homes.What's going on? These terrible events are consistent with what climate scientists have told us to expect from a warmer climate: wetter (and therefore more powerful) storms in some places; hotter, prolonged droughts in others. Our planet is a complicated and surprisingly sensitive system. Radically altering inputs such as the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is like letting a toddler randomly start flipping switches in the cockpit of an in-flight 747. How many switches do you think can be safely flipped? I'd hate to find out.Although nothing could justify the devastation and heartbreak caused by Sandy in the East or by the fires and floods in the West, there has been one positive result. We've reached a tipping point in public concern about climate disruption. No longer does this issue seem like something that will happen in a distant future and to someone else. Even if we haven't experienced extreme weather firsthand, we know someone who has.What can we do about it? First, we have to kick that kid out of the cockpit. We need to reduce and ultimately eliminate the carbon pollution that is altering our atmosphere and disrupting our climate. We've made progress, too. Last year, greenhouse gas emissions reported to the EPA by polluters reached their lowest level in almost 20 years. At the same time, clean-energy technologies like wind and solar are growing exponentially -- faster than anyone could have guessed just a few years ago.And yet, it's still not fast enough. The disaster that is runaway climate pollution won't begin to subside until we stop burning fossil fuels entirely and start running our economy on 100 percent clean energy. We can do that, too, but it won't happen through wishful thinking. We need to act. President Obama's climate action plan, although not perfect, includes the first-ever action by the EPA to limit climate-disrupting carbon emissions from their single biggest source: power plants. While standards for gas plants still need to be strengthened, the new standards would clean up new coal power plants, and the agency is planning to propose similar standards for existing power plants next year.No one can stop the next superstorm, mega wildfire, or 1,000-year flood. But we can get behind stopping the pollution that's disrupting our climate. Tell the EPA right now: We need the strongest possible safeguards against industrial carbon pollution from new coal and gas-burning power plants."}, {"title": "Watchdog Warns Of 'Dirty Dozen' Hormone Disruptors As Scientists, Industry Argue Regulation", "text": "Bisphenol A has gotten a much higher profile in recent years, as the \"BPA-free\" label adorns an increasing number of water bottles and baby products. News headlines regularly hint at possible connections between BPA and a lengthening list of health problems. But the ingredient is still common in plastics, food can liners -- and in our bodies.The chemical can be found in 93 percent of Americans, according to a guide released Monday by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group and the Keep-A-Breast Foundation. And BPA is just one of many everyday chemicals that even at very low levels could harm our bodies by mimicking or blocking the natural hormone messengers responsible for everything from sleep and metabolism to growth and reproduction.\"We're seeing more and more of these chemicals,\" said Johanna Congleton, senior scientist with EWG.The groups' new \"Dirty Dozen\" guide to what they deem the worst endocrine-disrupting chemicals lists ingredients that can be found in rocket fuel, brake fluid, flame retardants, herbicides and non-stick frying pans, as well as notorious carcinogens and neurotoxins such as lead, arsenic and mercury.\"It's not just BPA,\" Congleton said. \"Dioxin, for example, interacts with receptors in charge of development in the womb, the way the digestive system works, puberty. At the same time, we're exposed to a mixture of these chemicals.\"But not everyone is convinced that endocrine disruptors pose a public health risk, and the science is complicated, to put it lightly. With widespread debate about tighter regulation of toxic chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, the stakes are high for both industry and society -- much as they were when criticisms first arose over lead paint and tobacco.Proposed European Union policy, for example, could influence the global manufacture of endocrine disruptors. That debate escalated this July when 18 scientists published an editorial arguing that the EU rules, outlined in a leaked draft, were \"based on virtually complete ignorance of all well-established and taught principles of pharmacology and toxicology.\" An onslaught of charged responses from hundreds of doctors and toxicologists ensued. Meanwhile, an investigative report by Environmental Health News in September found that 17 of the 18 authors of the original editorial had industry ties.Andrea Gore was the lead author of one response, published in the September issue of Endocrinology, which pointed to \"thousands of published studies,\" as well as recent reviews by the United Nations and World Health Organization, that found endocrine disruptors are \"active at very low doses and can induce a range of adverse health outcomes many of which are not examined in traditional toxicology assays.\"\"There's so much evidence now that for people to deny this is happening, in my opinion, is very disingenuous,\" said Gore, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at The University of Texas at Austin.\"You can always find a paper that contradicts a finding,\" she added. \"But if you have one out of 101 papers finding something, that's very different than 100 of 101.\"One of the more controversial topics in the field is the possibility that even tiny amounts of endocrine disruptors can profoundly affect the body. A small perturbation in the balance of natural hormones, experts note, has long been known to pose potentially devastating health consequences.\"We've understood for some time the importance of having normal hormone levels,\" said Gore. \"We need the right levels at the right times to lead healthy lives.\"This is particularly critical during certain periods of development, such as during fetal development. The Endocrine Disruptor Exchange, which is now celebrating its 10-year anniversary, has released an updated chart identifying \"critical windows of development\" during which a growing fetus is especially sensitive to tiny doses of hormone mimics.Regulations, however, have been traditionally written to identify general thresholds for safe exposures, explained Carol Kwiatkowski, executive director of the nonprofit research group and an adjunct at the University of Colorado Boulder. If future rules go against the familiar paradigm of \"the dose makes the poison\" in favor of acknowledging no safe threshold for the chemical class, the implications could be vast.\"Endocrine disruptors turn everything on its head,\" added Kwiatkowski, \"and that makes people nervous.\"Accumulating evidence also suggests that exposure to endocrine disruptors could pass harm down to later generations. A study published in January found that descendants of rats exposed to BPA developed disease. The third generation had \"significant increases\" in pubertal abnormalities, testis disease, ovarian disease and obesity. Another suspected endocrine disruptor, DDT, made headlines last week after the release of a study suggesting the insecticide may have played a role in high rates of obesity among rats three generations after exposure.Industry representatives, in response to questions from The Huffington Post, remained critical of the proposed EU regulations and emphasized uncertainties in the science over BPA, phthalates and other chemicals highlighted in the new guide.\"Unfortunately, recent EU proposals for regulating endocrine disruptors are based on a narrow, hazard-based approach that offers only a one-sided and incomplete view of potential health and environmental risks,\" Scott Jensen, spokesman with the American Chemistry Council, told HuffPost in a statement. \"ACC believes the best approach is one that is risk-based and considers both hazard characterization and exposure.\"\"ACC is committed to constructively engaging with the scientific community and regulatory agencies to enhance the scientific understanding of chemicals and how they may interact with the endocrine system,\" he added, noting the group continues to advise the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on screening and testing chemicals.Experts consulted by HuffPost agreed that many questions about the actions and adverse effects of endocrine disruptors remain unanswered. The point of disagreement seems to hinge on how best to proceed based on the available evidence.Laura Vandenberg, an endocrine disruptor researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, expressed her frustration with the pace of policy and the influence of industry.\"We see some of the same tactics: hiring experts, seeding doubt, well-planned press releases,\" she said, citing previous battles waged over lead and cigarettes. Endocrine disruptors pose a far more complicated challenge, given the sheer breadth of the implicated products and their potential health impacts.While Vandenberg cheered the efforts of the Environmental Working Group in raising consumer awareness about the dozen chemicals and how best to avoid them, she said the new guide also further rouses her impatience with regulators.\"We're still having the conversation about what consumers should be doing, when realistically consumers can't avoid these chemicals,\" added Vandenberg, who was among 41 scientists who authored another rebuttal to criticism of the EU proposal. \"A mom shouldn't have to be a chemist to go to the grocery store.\"Joel Tickner, an environmental health expert at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, discussed the difficulty of controlling these products at the policy level.\"We're exposed to a lot of endocrine disruptors. The effects are cumulative,\" said Tickner. \"There's really no way to regulate chemicals in products easily without substituting.\"But that doesn't mean manufacturers should swap out BPA for something like bisphenol S, a close chemical cousin that has shown signs of similar, if not greater, toxicity. Rather, Tickner echoed previous calls for a new green chemistry, in which products are designed from the ground up to minimize the use of hazardous substances.Vandenberg is in the initial phases of starting her own lab, which she pledges will not focus on BPA. \"If you look at how much money, time and effort has gone into this one chemical, it's ridiculous,\" said Vandenberg, who has spent years studying BPA.\"We know enough about this chemical,\" she said. \"We know its effects at low doses. We know its concerning effects on organs. The evidence is overwhelming.\""}, {"title": "Scientists Discover 3 New Species In Australia's 'Lost World' (PHOTOS)", "text": "In a remote mountain range on Australia's Cape York Peninsula, there lies what scientists are calling a \"lost world.\"Isolated for possibly millions of years, the small patch of rainforest is home to at least three new species: a leaf-tail gecko, a blotched boulder-frog and a shade skink (or lizard). However, the discovery of the new creatures in the remote, rocky area of Cape Melville -- which is inhospitable to humans -- may just be the first of several findings to come.\"What's really exciting about this expedition is that in a place like Australia, which people think is fairly well explored, there are still places like Cape Melville where there are all these species to discover,\" photographer Tim Laman, who documented the expedition for National Geographic, told the publication.In a joint collaboration, researchers from Australia's James Cook University and National Geographic dropped out of a helicopter to explore the mountainous range of rainforest and collect samples. Though the four-day expedition took place in March, the team only recently released its findings after confirming the species are distinct from others currently known to science.Lead researcher Dr. Conrad Hoskin, of James Cook University, described the remote area as a \"truly wild place.\"\"It's protected by the boulder fields, which keep fire out and moisture in, which is quite conducive to hanging on to some really interesting rainforest creatures through time,\" he told The Australian.Of the new species, the discovery of the gecko may be the most exciting, since leaf-tailed geckos are thought to be primitive lizards that once flourished in the Australian rainforest. Distinct from others in its family, the Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko hunts at night and uses its flat, camouflaged body to lie in wait for its insect prey.The Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko, named Saltuarius eximius, is able to blend in with its surroundings. (Photo courtesy of Conrad Hoskin)After uncovering the gecko, researchers also happened upon two other vertebrate creatures. A brown-spotted amphibian -- named the blotched boulder-frog -- is believed to live among boulders in the remote region and only emerges from moist conditions beneath the rocks to feed and breed during the rainy summer season.The blotched boulder-frog, named Cophixalus petrophilus, lives among rocks in the mountainous range. (Photo courtesy of Conrad Hoskin)The Cape Melville shade skink, the third species discovered by the team, hunts its prey during the day. With long limbs and an elongated frame, the gold-colored creature is able to run and leap over rocks to capture insects.The Cape Melville shade skink, or Saproscincus saltus, was also found in the rocky rainforest region. (Photo courtesy of Conrad Hoskin)Scientific analyses of the newly uncovered creatures have been published this month in peer-reviewed journal Zootaxa. The team plans to conduct further expeditions to the boulder-filled portion of rainforest in Cape Melville to search for more species.\"Finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime -- I'm still amazed and buzzing from it,\" Hoskin said in a written statement."}, {"title": "Using Drones in the Fight Against Apple Scab", "text": "Article and photography by Rachel RohrFor apple growers in the eastern United States, the biggest problem -- the most relentless, pervasive, unavoidable issue, which can ruin a whole crop if not managed aggressively -- is apple scab. Researchers at the University of New Hampshire are working on a new tool to combat the apple scourge: A drone.The fungal infection causes dark scabby lesions on the leaves and skin of the apple, which leaves the flavor unaffected, but does effectively make it unsalable.\"It's a huge issue,\" says Peter Wagner, owner of Applecrest Farm Orchards, a 110-acre orchard in southeast New Hampshire. \"Thirty years ago, you were allowed to have a scab on your apple that was probably 10 millimeters, or half the size of a dime, without a problem at all. Now you can't put any of that in the apple pack, so it renders the apple unmarketable.\"Apple scab is less of an issue in drier regions, such as Washington state. But in places like New York, New Hampshire, Vermont or Massachusetts, apple scab is the number one pathogen and apple farmers' primary concern.In recent decades, researchers have made strides in understanding the fungus's life cycle, so farmers are spraying less than they used to, with better results. Some farmers even use predictive models, such as the Dutch program RIMpro to forecast the best spraying times. But apple scab is still a persistent battle, and it's especially difficult - if not nearly impossible - for organic farmers to grow a scab-free crop.So researchers at the University of New Hampshire are working on a new tool for fighting apple scab: Drones.Researchers Matthew Wallhead and Kirk D. Broders stand with the prototype apple scab drone.\"When you think about apple production now, a grower needs to walk through his orchard every day to make sure he sees any new insect pests or any new disease pests that come into an orchard,\" says plant pathologist Kirk D. Broders, an assistant professor at UNH. \"But when you're talking about a 10, 20, 100-acre orchard, your ability to do that on a daily basis is almost impossible.\"But it is possible with a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, carrying an infrared camera that takes multispectral images of the orchard. A computer program crunches the wavelengths in each pixel, making it possible to hone in on colors and temperatures - and locate apple scab.\"If you had a UAV that had the capacity to go up once a day, take a digital image or multiple digital images -- both in infrared and then in normal spectrum -- you could actually monitor your orchard using a $2,000 UAV,\" says Broders.Graduate student Matthew Wallhead is leading the project at UNH, and built the first such system this summer for about $2,400. It includes a low-cost surveillance drone from a Massachusetts startup called Rotary Robotics - though Wallhead prefers the term UAV as \"the term 'drone' has traditionally implied a weaponized system,\" he says -- and two point-and-shoot digital cameras. Wallhead removed the infrared filters from the cameras using an online tutorial.\"We converted a $100 camera into the equivalent of what a $4,000 camera will give you, so that's exciting,\" says Wallhead. \"This season has been largely focused on tuning it and learning to fly the aircraft effectively.\"Broders says the ultimate goal is to develop an orchard-monitoring UAV system that could be sold to growers for under $2,500, though he estimates they're five years away from an actual product.It's not the first time that multispectral imaging has been used in agriculture. Researchers have analyzed plants using lab equipment, and large farming operations can hire airplanes to fly over and take multispectral images of large swaths of corn or soybeans to monitor crop health.\"What we are trying to do is develop a system that allows us to do things in-between - so not at the single-plant lab scale, and not at the airplane several-fields-at-a-time scale,\" Broders said. \"We're trying to develop a low-cost system that could actually be used by either individual researchers or individual growers.\"At Applecrest Farm, Peter Wagner calls the prospect of an affordable infrared imaging system that could be used daily, \"pretty awesome.\"\"I think that's a great endeavor -- no question -- particularly the fact that most scab that we don't eradicate usually occurs at the top of the tree,\" Wagner said. \"In the old days with big trees, you could climb up and look around - which is time consuming - but now with the new plantings, the trees are younger, smaller, and it's harder to climb because the limbs aren't as strong.\"Wallhead and Broders envision apple growers using the drone-camera system in conjunction with the predictive models for apple scab -- the real-time data that tell farmers when to spray.Matthew Wallhead charts out a hypothetical autopilot course for the drone.\"The UAV is really only one tool we're using to manage apple scab, because apple scab is so difficult to control,\" Broders said. \"We're using our predictive model to improve application of organically-certified compounds. We're using the UAV for early detection. And then whenever possible, we're utilizing resistant varieties to also help us reduce fungicide inputs and provide better control.\"One scab-resistant variety growing in the experimental research orchard at UNH's Woodman Farm is Crimson Crisp, the product of collaboration among Purdue University, Rutgers and University of Illinois.While apple scab is the main concern in the eastern U.S., the multispectral data can also be used to detect other problems - from insect damage to nitrogen deficiency. Pinpointed applications of fertilizer, pesticides and fungicides mean growers are using less, which is better for the environment and consumers -- as well as the farmer's bottom line.The drones could even be used to monitor forest health, scanning for disease or invasive beetles.\"I think it has applications even beyond agriculture,\" Broders said. \"And I think there are a number of people that are just now beginning to understand what these unmanned aerial vehicles are capable of doing.\"This post was originally published on Modern Farmer."}, {"title": "I've Adopted You, You're Adorable, Now Behave!", "text": "When my kids were toddlers they obeyed me like well-mannered puppies. I could displace their frustrations with a wave of the iPad, redirect their fears with calm reassurance and quash disagreements with an ice pop. These days I long for a metaphorical crate. On a recent trip to the apple orchard, their consternation flared over who would occupy the coveted seat in the back of our family mini-van.   Pointing out the obvious -- that there were three seats -- fell on deaf ears. I then announced, albeit humorously, that October was National Adoption Month and if they didn't behave I'd be happy to drop them off at a local animal shelter.This bought a momentary reprieve.\"Why can you only adopt pets in October?\" my kindergartener pondered aloud.\"That's not it, Dumbo!\" my nine-year-old scoffed, rolling her eyes. Then she asked if we'd adopted any of our rescues in the fall, which only further perplexed her little brother.\"Does it count if we don't adopt in October? Do we have to give them back?\"My longwinded explanation of how our country chose to commemorate animal rescue in October to highlight the importance of these efforts, put their intrigue to rest. They were back to sparing for the car's most sought-after position.While October highlights Pet Adoption in America, there is no ideal month to adopt a pet. I began my Huffington Post adoption series in August covering topics including where to go to find a dog, choosing the right dog or puppy, bringing your new family member home and identifying frustrations common to rehomed or transported pets, but I've used this month to outline a positive approach to training and reconditioning the habits of newly adopted dogs and puppies.(Geoffrey Tischman Photography)In last week's piece I outlined the top five complaints I hear from adoptive pet owners. Today I will begin to address how to use a positive approach to resolve these frustrations. Though the behaviors are different, they have a commonality: They develop as a consequence of the stress endured during the rehoming process.   Below I've listed solutions to three of the top five common frustrations found with rescue dogs. I'll detail tips for soothing separation anxiety and resource guarding in the coming week.Housetraining.  Rescue dogs come from many walks of life. Some were born into a free-ranging lifestyle and have never set a paw indoors. Others were pets, abandoned by people who are no longer emotionally, physically or financially able to care for them. Relinquished into the rehoming system, these dogs are temporarily housed in animal shelters or foster homes, often with many other confused/neglected dogs. Though shelter workers and volunteers are truly the stuff angels are made of, few can keep up with the needs of each individual pet. Dogs and puppies are often confined with or near other dogs and grow accustomed to smelling, standing or even resting in feces.Transitions into a loving home are wonderful for everyone involved, but it can be overwhelming too. It would seem that freedom, kindness, a healthy diet and warm housing should breed instantaneous appreciation from a dog or puppy, but it can take weeks for a dog to realize that their new home is forever and is not just another awkward passing. Giving a dog too much too fast may lead to a few accidents in the first days/weeks of their rehoming.Many adoptive parents have high hopes that their new pet will be housetrained. Some do prefer going outside or to papers to potty, but others can take days or weeks to catch on. Dogs often confuse a person's frustrated reaction as confrontation, which leads to stress, not comprehension. Stress leads back to -- can you guess? More accidents.A healthier approach is to assume that your new adoptee will need to be housetrained in your home. Housetraining does not have to be a four-letter word. Here is a quick hit list:Chewing.Dogs chew when they're teething and need to relieve tension. Rescue dogs often chew excessively. If a dog cannot find a satisfying chew he will settle on furnishings, shoes, etc. While it's tempting to think you can discipline this problem away by shouting at, tossing objects to or racing after your dog, dogs simply can't translate your reactivity into useful knowledge. Most dogs view angry reactions as confrontational play or worse, an attack. Theatrical human displays are scary no matter your species and lead to displacement activities. Whereas a child might chew their nails, many dogs \"tension chew.\"Dogs who chew need to chew. They may prefer sticks to nylon bones and rawhide to rope bones; if their stomach can handle it, provide it. Avoid anything that causes stomach upset, and please do buy American made toys and bones.As far as \"correcting\" chewing? That's a tricky topic. If a dog is tension chewing, it's like yelling at a nervous nail biter: The chewing will get worse, not better. If the new dog or puppy is simply confused:Hyper-Reactivity It's hard to avoid the pangs of despair when you walk into an animal shelter. Imagine being plucked from your home, plopped into a jail-like setting with no forewarning and being forced to conform to an unfamiliar situation and schedule. While those devoted to the rigors of rehoming dogs are saintly, the dogs have varying levels of reactivity as they struggle to conform to their displacement and new routine. Many develop manic routines as coping mechanisms, including frantic barking, jumping, nipping and overall hyperactivity.How should one cope with these routines? The temptation to discipline the dog is obvious. But thrusting, yelling or hitting a dog who is simply trying to self-sooth will backfire. The reactions will grow more intense. Here is a better way to begin:If you are longing for a coach to help you through the early stages of training and reconditioning your adoptive pet, be mindful in your search. You'll find nearly as many approaches to dog training as ice cream flavors. Those who urge you to clamp your puppy's mouth shut, throw objects or spray them in the face may mean well, but they are employing cruel, outdated punishments that serve to scare and not instruct your puppy. I was recently certified by the IAABC who doesn't permit membership before you pass a (grueling) examination that is then judged by a jury of accomplished behaviorists. A good trainer will not only train your dog, they will teach you good communication skills that will lead to a bond that will last a lifetime.Watch for the final installment on Separation Anxiety and Resource Guarding!"}, {"title": "Baby Bree Green Returned To Parents, Medical Marijuana Patients, After Custody Seizure", "text": "After battling with Michigan's Department of Human Services for six weeks, medical marijuana patients Steve and Maria Green regained custody of 8-month old daughter Brielle \"Bree\" Green Friday, MLive reports.The seizure of Baby Bree made headlines around Michigan after the state removed her from the Green's home in Lansing, Mich., last month, saying that the parents' marijuana usage posed a danger to their child.The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, passed in 2008 by voters, allows licensed caregivers to tend to a small amount of marijuana plants in the home. According to the law, Michigan medical marijuana users can't be denied custody of their children \"unless the person\u2019s behavior is such that it creates an unreasonable danger to the minor that can be clearly articulated and substantiated.\" Both parents are state-licensed marijuana users; Maria is also licensed as a caregiver, meaning that she can grow the plants in her home. Steve Green has used marijuana to treat his epilepsy, while Maria used it to combat symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Michigan Marijuana News said.The Greens' legal saga began in 2011, when police were investigating a home invasion in Auburn Hills, Mich., in the neighborhood where the Greens formerly lived. An officer smelled marijuana coming from their home. Police obtained a warrant and raided the home, confiscating 29 marijuana plants, according to MLive. The couple was charged with manufacturing marijuana, a four-year felony, despite being licensed to grow the plants.A custody dispute between Maria and her ex-husband over their school-aged son led to the boy's father filing a complaint that the Greens' home was unfit for children because the parents used marijuana around their kids. When officials from Child Protective Services visited their Lansing home and demanded to see the grow room, the parents declined unless a court order was produced, citing language in Michigan's medical marijuana law mandating that only one person is allowed to have access to grow rooms where marijuana plants are stored.Children's Protective Services caseworkers then petitioned to remove Bree from her parents' home because her mother had marijuana in the house, the Detroit Free Press reported. The baby, who was breastfeeding at the time, was placed in the care of Maria's mother, and the parents were allowed to see her only during scheduled visits.Bree Green and her father, Steve Green, photographed during a supervised visit. Photo via Free Bree Facebook page.According to the Lansing City Pulse, Ingham County Family Court removed Bree after the attorney referee, Rob Porter, said that marijuana in the home was inherently dangerous to children.\u201cIt is reasonable to assume that marijuana is being grown in that home with children being present, and that is dangerous for children to be involved in that situation,\u201d Porter said, according to the Michigan Marijuana News. \u201cWe have homes being robbed at gunpoint -\u2013 by individuals who know that children are at home.\u201dThe Oakland County Prosecutor's Office dropped all the charges against the Green family stemming from their 2011 arrest on Oct. 3 after receiving medical paperwork proving that Steve Green was a licensed medical marijuana patient, said Lansing City Pulse. At the time, Maria was a licensed caregiver, but not a patient.As part of an agreement made with Ingham County Judge Richard Garcia during a special hearing Friday, the Greens must attend parenting classes for 30 days and submit Bree to regular drug-testing, according to parts of the agreement which were made public. In the meantime, they've been able to bring Bree back home. If they meet all of the provisions of their agreement, the matter will be dropped for good.The Greens, who denied they ever smoked marijuana around their children, will also be allowed to continue growing medical marijuana in their home. As a caretaker, Maria Green is licensed to provide marijuana for her husband and five other cancer patients.\"It's great because it was such a difficult position for [Maria] and myself,\" Steve Green said to MLive. \"I would die for Bree, but I don't think I should have to choose that.\"Watch video of the Green's reaction after their daughter was seized from them:"}, {"title": "Will California Save the Bees?", "text": "Last week I sat through a long hearing in the California legislature, all about bee declines. By the end, I was both excited and frustrated. As I noted in my closing comments at the hearing, California can and must take action to address the dramatic declines.This is an important opportunity for the state to be a driver of good public policy nationally. And addressing the issue here in California will be good for our business -- the benefits of bees to our agricultural economy are tremendous. While it was encouraging to see legislators taking the issue up at the hearing, it was frustrating to see the room filled with pesticide corporations and their allies trying to confuse the discussion and delay action.California is a already a driver of what happens nationally on bees, just from the reality of how beekeeping works. Many beekeepers pollinate almonds in California, then move on to pollinate other crops -- from apples to pumpkins and blueberries -- across the country.So fewer bees in California means fewer bees for the entire food and farming system.Beekeepers call for action Bret Adee, a commercial beekeeper who has been pollinating California almonds for over 23 years explained this to legislators last Wednesday:There's a great nervousness in the whole industry ... The way to have bees for California is that they have to leave California healthier than they came in. Nationwide, we are at the edge of not being able to restock our bees. Beekeeper after beekeeper I've talked to this year has less bees than last year, no matter all his efforts to restock.Legislators didn't seem to be getting the message, though it wasn't for lack of trying. As Assemblymembers Susan Eggman, Luis Alejo and Mariko Yamada probed, the state officials at the hearing failed to share meaningful information.\"There isn't a safe place for bees to be in California without exposure to pesticides\"\"There isn't a safe place for bees to be in California without exposure to pesticides,\" Susan Kegley, PhD, CEO of Pesticide Research Institute and a consulting scientist for PAN told the legislators.What seemed remarkable to me from state officials who testified was the lack of urgency and any clear plan of action on pesticides, especially given the scientific evidence on neonicotinoids. Just as Europe has done, California has an opportunity to immediately take steps to protect bees. Yet officials seem to be skirting the issue, passing the buck to an intransigent EPA.Confusing the issue Pesticide industry lobbyists and allies tried to divert attention to issues like the pesky Varroa mite and the lack of food or forage for bees. As I've mentioned before, it's a common industry tactic to redirect attention away from pesticides to issues that face less opposition. In doing so, they further confuse the problem and limit opportunities for action.The confusion is largely driven by industrial agriculture lobbyists like Kahn, Soares and Conway (you might remember them from methyl iodide) and AMVAC, a pesticide company known for buying patents for some of the most hazardous pesticides.Mites and large monocultures -- lacking food -- have indeed created stress on bees. \"We had mites in the country for over 15 years, maybe 16 or 17 years, before we had abnormal failures in the winter time,\" Adee explained to legislators at the hearing.No doubt we can and should find all manner of ways to strengthen the resilience of bees, and we can't ignore some of the most clear and effective ways to do that. And controls on bee-harming pesticides is the place to start.What California can do California has a long tradition of driving pesticide policy reforms -- and the need and the opportunity are clear.In a letter penned by PAN, beekeepers from Santa Barbara and San Diego, as well as partner groups like Beyond Pesticides and Center for Food Safety, we urged state officials to take three steps:Take action\u00bb Send a message to California leaders that they should step up to protect bees, for beekeepers, our food system and the state's economy."}, {"title": "If You Were A Farm Animal, Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary Would Be Paradise", "text": "This isn't what people usually mean when they say they've got a chicken heating up in the kitchen.Harrison the chicken sits on a padded cushion on top of a heater, by the kitchen window, so that he can keep an eye on his companion, Clarice, and his enemy, a rooster named Alvin. Though he has long white feathers, Harrison is 6 years old and \"he gets cold,\" his owner, Terry Cummings, explained.Cummings and her husband, Dave Hoerauf, run one of the country's only farm-animal rescues, Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary, on 400 acres in Western Maryland. The farm is only about an hour from the nation's capital, but with the trees and hills and chickens -- not to mention the lack of folks in khakis talking about the debt ceiling -- it seems much farther.And speaking of chickens: In addition to Harrison and Clarice, plus Harrison's clucking nemesis, Alvin, Cummings and Hoerauf have some 60 other chickens of a variety of provenances. They fell off trucks, or came from animal shelters after backyard hen-keeping didn't work out for suburbanites. Some recent acquisitions had been mailed in a box to a man who decided he didn't want the chicks and just threw the box away. Then add in about a half-dozen turkeys, 40 pigs, 3 horses, several donkeys, 22 goats, 19 sheep and 11 cows, all of whom have names and many of whom also bear stories of abuse, neglect or lucky escapes from slaughter.They've got it better these days. During a recent visit, a 1,000-pound pig named Patsy, who was removed from her home in North Carolina where she was being starved, was treated to a belly rub. And Sophie -- a newly arrived pig, still small -- snuggled with a teddy bear under a heat lamp before getting up for some treats. She'd been sold as a pot-belly to a family by a farmer at the side of the road; they quickly discovered that she wasn't as advertised and dispatched her elsewhere before she landed at Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary.\"I taught her to sit!\" Cummings said, holding out a banana to Sophie.Cummings and Hoerauf opened the sanctuary in 1996. The pair had been renting a farmhouse dated to the 1730s on the site -- with Cummings commuting to D.C. to work as a veterinary technician at the National Zoo, and Hoerauf working in printing -- while the surrounding property was rented out to a beef cattle farmer. The couple got to know the animals. They developed relationships. Then one day the slaughter truck arrived.\u201cIt occurred to me that my next hamburger could be one of my friends,\u201d is how Cummings described this development to The Washington Post.Meat exited the diet, and, after a long talk with the property's owner, rescued farm animals replaced the beef cattle. Over time, the land was donated by the couple's landlord -- the one who'd once rented property to the farmer whose animals were destined to be meat, and whose original lease, somewhat ironically, prohibited cats and dogs in the house.\"We didn't have any cats and dogs,\" Cummings said. \"We had ducks and chickens.\"There still aren't any traditional pets running around. (And, being vegan, the birds' eggs aren't eaten by humans; every day, they're collected and left in the woods for skunks and foxes.)Poplar Spring specializes in animals that Cummings and Hoerauf say are often overlooked -- kids aren't generally taught to love cows and chickens, and even animal abuse laws generally exempt farm animals. So on top of caring for the 200-odd rescues who will live out their natural lives at Poplar Spring, the sanctuary is open to visitors such as school groups, as a way to promote the message that all animals, including farm animals, deserve humane treatment.\"Here they're treated with love and tenderness,\" Cummings said. \"Of all the animals that need help, it seems like farm animals need it the most.\"In a couple of weeks, on Nov. 23, the sanctuary will hold one of its annual events. It's a vegan potluck, where Poplar Spring's six turkeys get their own table -- in a twist on the usual Thanksgiving meal, visitors feed them.One of the guests of honor this year will be a turkey named Perry, who arrived at Poplar Spring in 2012, on the night before Thanksgiving.Here's how Cummings and Hoerauf described Perry's origin story on Facebook:We received quite a Thanksgiving Day surprise when we discovered this beautiful boy turkey in a crate in the middle of our driveway late last night!! No note or phone call or any clue as to who brought him or where he came from. It is a mystery, but we will welcome him in to live happily here with our other rescued turkeys, who he will hopefully be friends with. Unlike the millions of other turkeys on this day, he is a very lucky guy.You could think of this bird as a living, breathing, lucky feathered Thanksgiving parable. Or maybe he's a sign that the farm's outreach is having some effect.Here's a video from the 2010 Thanksgiving with the Turkeys:This is Hoerauf with one of the Poplar Spring goats:And here's Cummings with a rescued pigeon on her head:"}, {"title": "A Lesson From Sandy: Why We Need to Fortify Vulnerable Communities", "text": "One year ago this week, we all received an unforgettable warning about the potential of climate change to alter our lives. When Hurricane Sandy struck the Atlantic coast it destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, and worse -- it cut short the lives of 150 residents.The storm drove home a somber lesson -- one that Hurricane Katrina first taught us eight years ago. When disaster strikes, those with the fewest resources have a harder time preparing, escaping, and recovering.Climate change threatens all of us. But low-income Americans and communities of color are especially vulnerable to disasters, severe weather, and pollution. Yet this problem has by and large failed to enter the public discourse.In all of the conversations about climate -- and throughout the significant gains we've seen, including the president's Climate Action Plan -- there has been little to no mention of the unique vulnerabilities of these communities.In New York, six of the waterfront boroughs most susceptible to storm surges are predominantly low-income communities of color -- South Bronx, Sunset Park, Red Hook, Newtown Creek, Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the North Shore of Staten Island.And it's not just storms that affect people of color disproportionately. One study showed that African Americans in Los Angeles are twice as likely to die in a heat wave, due to a combination of lack of access to vehicles and air conditioning, and neighborhoods that are concrete-dense and provide little shade.Meanwhile, communities of color bear the brunt of health risks associated with climate pollution. Sixty-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a polluting coal plant; coal pollution causes asthma, heart disease, cancer, and an estimated 13,000 premature deaths each year.We have to acknowledge that the social, economic, and infrastructural stability of a community all help determine how well it will survive a flood, a fire, or a hurricane. We need to be clear about identifying places that need the most help shoring up these factors. And our resources should be distributed accordingly.Since Sandy struck, \"resilience\" has become a buzzword. There's a lot of talk about helping communities bounce back after disaster strikes. And that's important, because it's time for us to start thinking not just about how to eliminate the carbon pollution that causes climate change, but how to deal with the effects that we're too late to stop.But there's more to the story. For communities of color and poor Americans, the idea of bouncing back doesn't work. If you're struggling to feed your kids and keep a roof over your head before a disaster strikes, the goal of returning to business-as-usual after the disaster passes is simply not enough.We need to aim higher. Not only should climate action plans like the president's address the fact that some communities are at greater risk than others, they should actively work to fortify these communities.Vulnerable communities don't just need funds to create emergency shelters; they need long-term investment in the things that will make them stronger -- including public health, economic vitality, and social cohesion. These neighborhoods don't need a plan for a rebound; they need a plan for a rebirth.And climate investments offer an opportunity to do just that. Consider stormwater infrastructure. We know that we have to fix and overhaul stormwater infrastructure in many of our cities in order to respond to the increased risk of floods we face as a result of climate change. In fact, the EPA has estimated that we need to spend $188.4 billion just to make basic repairs to America's crumbling stormwater infrastructure. But there's a tremendous opportunity -- because that investment will create roughly 2 million jobs. If we connect these opportunities to folks who have historically been left behind, we'll build stronger communities in the process.But it's not just people of color and low-income Americans who have a stake in this issue. It's all of us. These communities are just the canary in the coalmine. They show us where everyone is headed if we don't act. We're all in the same boat -- some are just the first to feel the wave hit.These communities have something to teach us, too. The same neighborhoods hit hardest by climate change have already survived through decades of divestment, pollution, meager public services and other hardships. In many of these places, nonprofit organizations, faith groups, and green businesses are already working together to address the social, economic and health needs that influence their ability to adapt.We can't prevent another disaster like Sandy and Katrina from striking. What we can prevent is much of the chaos, destruction, and senseless loss of lives that we witnessed. More importantly, we can seize this opportunity to bring good jobs, clean air, and economic prosperity to communities on the edge. The right climate strategies will make sure they do more than bounce back; they'll ensure that they come back stronger, healthier, and more vibrant than ever before."}, {"title": "Why Is the Succulent in My Terrarium Rotting?", "text": "This question originally appeared on Quora.   Answer by Sarah Householder, Product Designer at QuoraRotting usually means there is too much moisture.To prevent this from happening in the future, make sure the soil around your succulent has excellent drainage. When I have a succulent in a humid or low-airflow location, I usually start with a soil that is intended for succulents (like Miracle Gro or others) and then dilute it 50-50 with pumice or perlite. (Sand is another alternative, but it needs to be special washed sand that is intended for plant use -- random sand from your yard or a playground often contains elements that will hurt your plants.)If your terrarium is moist all the time, you may even want to consider putting the succulent in 100% pumice or perlite. Succulents can often grow just fine under those conditions. That said, it is also possible that your terrarium is just too moist for a succulent to ever really thrive in there -- though it's difficult to know for sure without knowing more about your setup.If you want to recover your rotting plant, your best shot is to cut away absolutely all of the rotted parts with a sharp knife, throw out the soil in which it was rotting, and replace it with fresh well-draining soil. If it is adjacent to plants that need soil that retains water, try building up a little hill to elevate the succulent so that it can drain while the others get the wet soil. Alternatively, you could also put your succulent in its own little well-draining container within the terrarium.It's also worth noting that different succulents have different moisture needs. Generally, succulents with thick leaves need less frequent watering (and rot more easily) than succulents with thin leaves. Consequently, thick-leaved succulents typically need better-draining soil (with more pumice or perlite) than thin-leaved succulents.Here are some examples of thick-leaved succulents:And here are some examples of thin-leaved succulents:Other examples of thin-leaved succulents include most sempervivums and varieties of the Crown of Thorns plant (Euphorbia milii)."}, {"title": "Growing Urban Ag Through Policy", "text": "All across the country, the urban agriculture movement is growing. Communities are raising fruits and vegetables in places as varied as vacant lots, backyards and such public properties as vacant fields, schoolyards, parks, utility rights-of-way and even the rooftops of public buildings. These communities can see many benefits: new sources of fresh and healthy food, food literacy, job skills development, urban greening, promotion of civic participation, public safety and urban revitalization.In many cases, urban gardening begins organically, but without a supportive policy structure in place, it can be difficult for these programs to take root, thrive and be of maximum and equitable benefit to the whole community. These policy structures might consist of changes to existing zoning code, or they could consist of partnership agreements that help spread the responsibility for a successful urban gardening program across complementary groups.Here are two examples of communities that have successfully built such policy structures:Cleveland Community Gardens. Access this map here.To make this a reality, the city updated their zoning code in November 2010 to permit urban agriculture in residential districts, which had been banned under the previous zoning code. Also, the Ohio Department of Agriculture came out with guidance on which home-grown and homemade products can and cannot be sold, and how products for sale need to be processed, packaged and labeled.In Cleveland, San Jose, and other communities in which urban and community gardening has taken root, partnerships have been key to helping those projects achieve their full community transformation potential. Successful partnerships are built on agreements that define the relationship between individuals, community organizations, and public entities, and provide clarity to everyone involved.These agreements can take many forms -- they can be informal agreements, leases, licenses, contract, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), permits or joint use agreements. Different types of agreements are right for different communities, but most should address the following issues:With these issues covered, your community will be better prepared to reap and sustain the full benefits of urban gardening and greening.ChangeLab Solutions is here to help think through what agreements would best seed the ground for a rich harvest for every member of your community.ChangeLab Solutions offers an array of tools to help make community gardening a reality, including Dig, Eat, and Be Healthy: A Guide to Growing Food on Public Property, and Seeding the City: Land Use Policies to Promote Urban Agriculture.This work was originally published on CommunityCommons.org."}, {"title": "Leaked Documents Reveal The Secret Finances Of A Pro-Industry Science Group", "text": "The American Council on Science and Health defends fracking, BPA, and pesticides.

You know, all that fracking and those luscious deposits of oil shale and gas shale just waiting to be pounded into shape to fill global gas tanks for an energy-rich future. And then, of course, just to the north there are those fabulous Canadian tar sands deposits whose extraction is reportedly turning parts of Alberta into an environmental desert. And that isn't all.From the melting Arctic, where the Russians and others are staking out energy claims, to the southernmost tip of South America, the dream of new energy wealth is being pursued with a fervor and avidity that is hard to take in. In distant Patagonia, an Argentinean government not previously known for its friendliness to foreign investment has just buddied up with Chevron to drill \"around the clock in pursuit of a vast shale oil reservoir that might be the world's next great oil field.\" Huzzah and ol\u00e9!And can you even blame the Argentinean president for her choice? After all, who wants to be the country left out of the global rush for new energy wealth? Who wants to consider the common good of the planet, when your country's finances may be at stake? (As with the Keystone XL pipeline protest movement here, so in Argentina, there actually are environmentalists and others who are thinking of the common good, but they're up against the state, the police, and Chevron -- no small thing.) All of this would, of course, be a wondrous story -- a planet filled with energy reserves beyond anyone's wildest dreams -- were it not for the fact that such fossil fuel wealth, such good news, is also the nightmarish bad news of our lives, of perhaps the lifetime of humanity.There is an obvious disconnect between what is widely known about climate change and the recent rush to extract \"tough energy\" from difficult environments; between the fires -- and potential \"mega-fire\" -- burning wildly across parts of overheated Australia and its newly elected government run by a conservative prime minister, essentially a climate denier, intent on getting rid of that country's carbon tax. There is a disconnect between hailing the U.S. as the new Saudi Arabia and the recent report of the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning that fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground -- or else. There is a disconnect between what our president says about climate change and the basic energy policies of his administration. There is a disconnect between what the burning of fossil fuels will do to our environment and the urge of just about every country on this planet to exploit whatever energy reserves are potentially available to it, no matter how \"dirty,\" no matter how environmentally destructive to extract.Somewhere in that disconnect, the remarkable Bill McKibben, whose new book, Oil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist, is at the top of my personal reading list, has burrowed in and helped to create a global climate change movement. In this country, it's significantly focused on the Keystone XL pipeline slated, if President Obama allows it to be built, to bring tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. That presidential decision, he writes in his most recent post, \"X-Ray of a Flagging Presidency,\" may prove to be a \"last chance\" for Obama with \"an increasingly disillusioned environmental movement.\""}, {"title": "X-Ray of a Flagging Presidency", "text": "Will Obama Block the Keystone Pipeline or Just Keep Bending?Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comAs the battle over the Keystone XL pipeline has worn on -- and it\u2019s now well over two years old -- it\u2019s illuminated the Obama presidency like no other issue. It offers the president not just a choice of policies, but a choice of friends, worldviews, styles. It\u2019s become an X-ray for a flagging presidency. The stakes are sky-high, and not just for Obama. I\u2019m writing these words from Pittsburgh, amid 7,000 enthusiastic and committed young people gathering to fight global warming, and my guess is that his choice will do much to determine how they see politics in this country.Let us stipulate at the start that whether or not to build the pipeline is a decision with profound physical consequences. If he approves its construction, far more of the dirtiest oil on Earth will flow out of the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and reach the U.S. Gulf Coast. Not just right away or for a brief period, but far into the future, since the Keystone XL guarantees a steady flow of profits to oil barons who have their hearts set on tripling production in the far north.The history of oil spills and accidents offers a virtual guarantee that some of that oil will surely make its way into the fields and aquifers of the Great Plains as those tar sands flow south. The greater and more daunting assurance is this, however: everything that reaches the refineries on the Gulf Coast will, sooner or later, spill into the atmosphere in the form of carbon, driving climate change to new heights.In June, President Obama said that the building of the full pipeline -- on which he alone has the ultimate thumbs up or thumbs down -- would be approved only if \u201cit doesn\u2019t significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.\u201d By that standard, it\u2019s as close to a no-brainer as you can get.These days, however, as no one will be surprised to hear, brainless things happen in Washington more often than not, and there\u2019s the usual parade of the usual suspects demanding that Keystone get built. In mid-October, a coalition that included Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Royal Dutch Shell, not to mention the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable, sent Obama a letter demanding that he approve Keystone in order to \u201cmaintain investor confidence,\u201d a phrase almost guaranteed to accompany bad ideas. A report last week showed that the Koch brothers stood to earn as much as $100 billion in profits if the pipeline gets built (which would come in handy in helping fund their endless assault on unions, poor people, and democracy).But don\u2019t think it\u2019s just Republican bigwigs and oil execs rushing to lend the pipeline a hand. Transcanada, the pipeline\u2019s prospective builder, is at work as well, and Obama\u2019s former communications director Anita Dunn is now on the Transcanada dime, producing TV ads in support of the pipeline. It\u2019s a classic example of the kind of influence peddling that knows no partisan bounds. As the activists at Credo put it: \u201cIt's a betrayal of the commitments that so many of us worked so hard for, and that Dunn herself played a huge role in shaping as top strategist on the 2008 campaign and communications director in the White House.\u201dCredo\u2019s Elijah Zarlin, who worked with Dunn back in 2008, wrote that attack on her. He was the guy who wrote all those emails that got so many of us coughing up money and volunteering time during Obama\u2019s first run for the presidency, and he perfectly exemplifies those of us on the other side of this divide -- the ones who actually believed Dunn in 2008, the ones who thought Obama was going to try to be a different kind of president.On energy there\u2019s been precious little sign of that. Yes, the Environmental Protection Agency has put in place some new power plant regulations, and cars are getting better mileage. But the president has also boasted again and again about his \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy for \u201cincreasing domestic oil production and reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\u201d It has, in fact, worked so well that the United States will overtake Russia this year as the biggest combined oil and natural gas producer on the planet and is expected to pass Saudi Arabia as the number one oil producer by 2017.His administration has okayed oil drilling in the dangerous waters of the Arctic and has emerged as the biggest backer of fracking. Even though he boasts about marginal U.S. cuts in carbon emissions, his green light to fracking means that he\u2019s probably given more of a boost to releases of methane -- another dangerous greenhouse gas -- than any man in history. And it\u2019s not just the environment. At this point, given what we know about everything from drone warfare to NSA surveillance, the dream of a progressive Obama has, like so many dreams, faded away.The president has a handy excuse, of course: a truly terrible Congress. And too often -- with the noble exception of those who have been fighting for gay rights and immigration reform -- he\u2019s had little challenge from progressives. But in the case of Keystone, neither of those caveats apply: he gets to make the decision all by himself with no need to ask John Boehner for a thing, and people across the country have made a sustained din about it. Americans have sent record numbers of emails to senators and a record number of comments to the State Department officials who oversee a \u201creview\u201d of the pipeline\u2019s environmental feasibility; more have gone to jail over this issue than any in decades. Yet month after month, there\u2019s no presidential decision.There are days, in fact, when it\u2019s hard to muster much fire for the fight (though whenever I find my enthusiasm flagging, I think of the indigenous communities that have to live amid the Mordor that is now northern Alberta). The president, after all, has already allowed the construction of the southern half of the Keystone pipeline, letting Transcanada take land across Texas and Oklahoma for its project, and setting up the beleaguered communities of Port Arthur, Texas, for yet more fumes from refineries.Stopping the northern half of that pipeline from being built certainly won\u2019t halt global warming by itself. It will, however, slow the expansion of the extraction of tar sands, though the Koch brothers et al. are busy trying to find other pipeline routes and rail lines that would get the dirtiest of dirty energy out of Canada and into the U.S. via destinations from Michigan to Maine. These pipelines and rail corridors will need to be fought as well -- indeed the fights are underway, though sometimes obscured by the focus on Keystone. And there are equally crucial battles over coal and gas from the Appalachians to the Pacific coast. You can argue that the president\u2019s people have successfully diverted attention from their other environmental sins by keeping this argument alive long past the moment at which it should have been settled and a decision should have been made.At this point, in fact, only the thought of those 900,000 extra barrels a day of especially nasty oil coming out of the ground and, via that pipeline, into refineries still makes the fight worthwhile. Oh, and the possibility that, in deciding to block Keystone, the president would finally signal a shift in policy that matters, finally acknowledge that we have to keep most of the carbon that\u2019s still in the ground in that ground if we want our children and grandchildren to live on a planet worth inhabiting.If the president were to become the first world leader to block a big energy project on the grounds of its effects on climate, it might help dramatically reset the international negotiations that he allowed to go aground at Copenhagen in 2009 -- the biggest foreign policy failure of his first term.But that cascade of \u201cifs\u201d depends on Obama showing that he can actually stand up to the oil industry. To an increasingly disillusioned environmental movement, Keystone looks like a last chance.Bill McKibben is Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College, founder of the global climate campaign 350.org, a TomDispatch regular, and the author of a new book, Oil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist.Follow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook or Tumblr.

Good thing. Since the release of \"The Vegucation of Robin,\" \"I've been mocked across the board,\" says Quivers . \"But I felt really, really good.\"Feeling good is a new phenom for Quivers. \"I was having health issues all my life. You're just not conditioned to think of them as health issues.\" Fatigue was normal, so was constant pain, poor circulation and weight gain. Cleanses helped her lose weight and feel better. . . until they made her feel worse. A nurse in her pre-Howard days, Quivers had never made the connection between what she ate and how she felt. \"Absolutely not,\" she says. \"I made the connection between food and weight, but feeling good or bad was a separate issue.\"One thing kept coming up -- the power of a plant-based diet. Quivers didn't care. Growing up, \"vegetables were the things that were left on the plate, the things I was punished for not eating. I couldn't wait to get away away from vegetables,\" she says. \"I thought being vegan was going to be some really horrible way of life that had no flavor.\" Vegans \"were boring, not fun, dogmatic, strict, restrictive and they were not enjoying life.\"And then a desperate Quivers saw the vegan light. \"I loved the way I felt. I loved being healthy,\" she says. She signed a book deal in 2007, wrote the book and ran her first marathon at the age of 58. Then cancer derailed everything. Try selling a vegan-for-health book with the author undergoing chemo. The publisher held the book and Stern held his tongue -- for a change. He arranged for Quivers to do their Sirius XM morning show from home, rather than in the studio and stood by her through 15 months of treatment and recovery. There's a reason she subtitles the book \"How Real Food Saved My Life.\" Quivers credits her recovery to her plant-based ways -- that and finding her way around her own kitchen.  \"I never cooked before I became vegan. Preparing a meal as opposed to ordering in all the time, you start thinking about where your food comes from and how it gets to your table. You notice that chain.\" That's been Quivers' real vegucation.\"The Vegucation of Robin\" is part personal story, part vegan basics and recipes from vegan chef Christopher Sanchez and part bad timing. \"I'm mockery-proof,\" says Quivers. \"I'm enjoying life so much.\"Snark all you want, just eat more vegetables.Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Fresh Rosemary   From \"The Vegucation of Robin Quivers, \"reprinted by permission by Avery, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC, A Penguin Random House Company \u00a9 Robin Quivers, 2013."}, {"title": "Superstorm Sandy: Then And Now (EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS) - Weather.com", "text": "Superstorm Sandy ravaged parts of the Northeast coast last year, leaving millions without power and wreaking havoc throughout neighborhoods.Read more on www.weather.com"}, {"title": "European Environment Ministers Urge EU To Adopt 'Ambitious' 2030 Climate Change Goals", "text": "LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Thirteen European environment ministers and dozens of business leaders urged the European Union on Monday to adopt \"ambitious\" energy and climate goals for 2030 to create a low-carbon economy in Europe to spur investment.In a 40-page document released at a green growth conference in Brussels, they also said the 28-nation bloc should reform the structure of the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) and offer a strict emissions cut pledge at a climate summit next autumn.Going against the tide of officials keen to blame green energy subsidies for higher energy bills, environment ministers from 13 EU countries and businesses including Coca Cola Enterprises and Shell called for action.Notable exceptions included coal-dependent Poland which has battled against EU proposals to shift to a low-carbon economy, although two weeks ago, Warsaw said it would lead the call for nations to deepen emissions cuts when it hosts United Nations' climate talks next month.\"Businesses and investors are telling us that the EU needs to get its act together ... only then will investors have the confidence to put the billions into low carbon that we need,\" Edward Davey, Britain's energy and climate change secretary, said in a statement.The EU has met a target to cut 1990-level greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, as a result of lower energy demand following recession and a shift towards green power, such as solar and wind.It is now debating a 2030 target and is expected to unveil proposals on the goal around the end of this year. EU sources have said the European Commission is looking at a 40 percent cut in domestic emissions versus 1990 levels by 2030.Last week, Britain said the EU should cut emissions by 50 percent by 2030 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.A decision on the EU's 2030 target will form the basis of the its potential emissions reduction offer as part of United Nations' climate negotiations on a global climate deal.Governments are under pressure to offer large cuts by a September summit hosted by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon.The European Commission is also considering ways to reform the structure of the ETS, its main tool to combat climate change.EU carbon permit prices have lost around 75 percent of their value over the past five years due to the over-supply of permits and dampened demand due to recession.The Commission is expected to publish structural reforms by the end of this year, but it has yet to confirm details.Some observers have said the favoured reform option would be to set up a mechanism to regulate the supply of EU carbon permits."}, {"title": "Brown University's Misguided Vote to Not Divest From Coal", "text": "Today, on the anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, Brown University defied the will of its student body and its own investment advisory committee and voted not to divest from the 15 largest U.S. coal companies.\"I'm deeply disappointed in our administration,\" said Brown student Ruby Goldberg '17. \"The board acted explicitly in opposition to the voices of Brown's community, and of the endowment oversight committee. This could have been a moment for Brown to step up as a leader in the fight against climate change. Instead, the administration chose to continue supporting an industry that profits from wreaking havoc on frontline communities and destroying our chance for a sustainable future.\"The decision comes as the fossil fuel divestment campaign continues to pick up momentum around the world. There are now active divestment campaigns underway at over 400 colleges, cities, and religious institutions across the US. The campaign is also spreading to Europe, where Bill McKibben and 350.org are kicking off the Fossil Free Europe tour in Berlin this evening. Recently, the University of Oxford published a study concluding that the fossil fuel divestment movement is growing even faster than past efforts that targeted apartheid and Big Tobacco.\"Students at Brown have worked as hard or harder than any others in the country and more to the point, they've done absolutely everything by the book,\" said Bill McKibben, the environmental writer and founder of 350.org, an international climate campaign helping coordinate the divestment campaign. \"They deserved to win this fight and in the long run they will win this fight, because it's their future at stake, not the future of a handful of rich people on the Brown board.\"The Board's vote came after a year of active campaigning from the Brown Divest Coal student campaign. Since the fall, students have held rallies, phone-\u00adbanked, hosted teach\u00ad-ins, met with administrators, and gathered over 3,600 petition signatures from students, alumni, faculty and staff in support of divestment.\"To me this vote shows that Brown doesn't take its commitments to social justice and combating climate change seriously,\" said Divest Coal member Kari Malkki '16. \"What's the point of teaching about climate science or environmental racism if we won't act on that knowledge? Today our administration was too timid to challenge the status quo, but we're going to keep pushing them to stand for what is right. Until then, our 'Boldly Brown' motto sounds laughable.\"There's good reason to believe that Brown's decision not to divest was influenced by the ties a number of its board members have to the fossil fuel industry. In an op-ed published in the Brown Daily Herald, members of the Brown Divest Coal Campaign identified several board members with significant holdings in the coal industry, including Brian Moynihan '81 P'14, president and CEO of Bank of America, which as of Aug. 14 has $1 billion worth of holdings in 14 of the 15 companies in question. Brown students recently published an oped requesting these board members recuse themselves from the coal divestment vote, but they received no response.\"The voting process at Brown echos the coal industry's stranglehold on our nation's governing bodies. Once again, a corrupt process lead to a dangerous outcome,\" said Ian Georgianna '15, a member of Brown Divest Coal. \"Unless we confront this system, we won't be able to make meaningful progress to address climate change.\"Brown University President Christina H. Paxson announced the Corporation's decision in an open letter posted on the university's website. While she acknowledged the threat posed by climate change and the environmental damage caused by the coal industry, she offered two faulty arguments to why the University would not divest.First, President Paxson argued that while coal posed certain environmental risks, it did not cause enough social harm to warrant divestment. This conclusion is directly contradicted by numerous studies that highlight the enormous social cost of coal consumption. The 2010 \"Hidden Cost of Energy\" study from the National Academy of Sciences estimated that the damage from coal fired power plant emission in 2005 cost the nation about $62 billion and that costs would only increase. A 2011 Harvard University study calculated that coal costs U.S. one-third to over one-half a trillion dollars annually. Coal is also one of the main drivers of climate change, which if left unaddressed could cut off up to 20 percent of global GDP according to the 2006 Stern Review.The University's own Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility and Investment Policy recently encouraged the Board to divest from the coal industry, writing, \"The companies recommended for divestment perpetrate grave, indeed egregious, social harm, and there is no possible way to square our profiting from such harm with the values and principles of the University.\"Second, President Paxson argued that divestment was an ineffective tool to changing the behavior of the fossil fuel industry and addressing the climate crisis, a claim that both academic studies, and historical experience, refute. A recent study by the University of Oxford concluded that the current fossil fuel divestment campaign is growing faster than any previous divestment campaign and could cause significant damage to coal, oil and gas companies. The campaign also has the blessing of a leader of the anti-apartheid divestment movement, Nobel-Peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who wrote, \"Divestment played a key role in helping liberate South Africa. The corporations understood money even when they weren't swayed by morality. Climate change is a deeply moral issue, too.\"The anti-apartheid movement continues to serve as a useful model for current divestment activists. Many universities, including Harvard, which recently said no to fossil fuel divestment, initially refused to divest from South Africa, only to later buckle under student pressure. The first fossil fuel divestment sit-in took place just down the road from Brown University at the Rhode Island School of Design. As students begin to receive more pushback from their (corporate controlled) boards, there will certainly be more."}, {"title": "The Trail of the Whales: Look How Far We've Come", "text": "We've nearly made it to the end of our journey. My toddler and I have been following the grey whale migration up the west coast of the Americas. I pieced the journey together using public transport, on a tight budget and tight schedule. We've been travelling by train, bus, boat and taking a few plane rides when we had no other option.In March we were in Baja, in Mexico. There, some whales were so friendly that they came right up to our little skiffs. We were able to touch them and even kiss them on the nose.We came up through Los Angeles, Monterey Bay, Depot Bay in Oregon, the San Juan Islands, past Vancouver Island and through the Inside Passage to Alaska. We then continued north, up to Point Barrow at the very top of the US.In Barrow, I heard how the grey whales had helped forge alliances between Yupik Eskimos in Russia and Inupiat Eskimos in the US.A close look at the map helps explain how. Both communities depend on hunting marine mammals, including whales, for survival and these cultural bonds are stronger than differences in nationality and location.The grey whales migrate through the Bering Strait and some go as far north as Point Barrow, Alaska. A few will make it all the way east from there to the Beaufort Sea, perhaps as far east as Canada. Others will cross the Chukchi Sea going northwest into the Siberian Sea.In the middle of the Bering Strait there are two islands, the Diomedes. One is Russian and the other American.Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, American Inupiat Eskimos from the Diomedes were able to visit Yupik Eskimos in Chukotka and deliver supplies. The authorities did not stop them because their sealskin umiaks did not show up on the radar, and because Soviet officials could not tell them apart in their furs.It's inspiring to hear how the whales have bridged international relationships and thrilling that they are now here in their Alaskan feeding grounds, having travelled all the way from Mexico.Problem is, we haven't actually seen any grey whales since Baja. We've somehow managed to miss them at every single stop since.Some places they just didn't show up that day, and one time the sea was too rough for us to go out on the water looking for them. I'm desperate to show my son that the mother and baby whale pairs have travelled all the way up here too, and to see them for myself.Leaving Barrow, there's one more stop on our journey, Kodiak Island. We're backtracking a little on the migration route, the ferries are infrequent and this was the only way we could fit it in.Kodiak here we come. Last stop. Last chance."}, {"title": "The War Against Wolves and Wildlife: Time to Stop the Killing", "text": "By the time this blog goes live this photo will probably have been pulled from Facebook. The photo, titled \"Wyoming is FED up,\" is posted on the FB page, Sportsmen Against Wolves.As of October 26th the photo had 563 likes and 307 shares, after being posted for less than three days. The posted public comments are disturbing:\"Love this!!!!! I fully understand the masks, yer not idiots like those daring you to show yer faces!!!! Keep on killing guys\"\"Smoke a pack a day\"\"Kill everyone you see boys!\"What is perhaps most disquieting about the photograph is the vigilante feel that echoes a lynch mob -- dehumanize, vilify, and murder. Wolves are now reviled and persecuted in a land where they once roamed wild and free prior to European colonization.While the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to remove federal protections for gray wolves through most of their historic range in the lower 48 States, blatant hostility toward wolves, coyotes, bears and other native carnivores has intensified. Like the photo above, the vilification of predators has taken on a new hue: one associated with righteous patriotism. But all true Americans should be concerned about this tenor of violence and hatred toward other living beings. What lessons are we teaching young people when we show such blatant disrespect and denigration of wildlife?...when \"we\" proudly post photos of men with their bloodied victims on Facebook and Twitter? (see this video posted on Facebook of a reported wolf being shot in Idaho -- warning: graphic) and when our own federal government condones this violence and wanton animal abuse in its lethal predator control programs?Anti-wolf hatred fueled a 2011 Congressional rider that removed federal protections for wolves in the Northern Rockies and Great Lakes thereby turning management over to the states in these regions. The result: In just seven days of this year's wolf hunt in Wisconsin, 97 wolves were killed -- about twice the pace at which wolves were killed last year, the state's inaugural and very controversial wolf-hunt season. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources estimates the total state wolf population to be around 800 -- and would like trappers and hunters to reduce the population to 350 -- a number scientists say is not sustainable.At least 1,321 wolves have been killed by trophy hunters and commercial and recreational trappers in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho alone. Montana sold over 6,000 wolf-hunting licenses this season; each license -- $19 for state residents -- allows a person to kill up to five wolves. The current wolf population in Montana is estimated at 625. Wolf watching generates approximately $30 million annually to the towns around Yellowstone; the cost to reintroduce and recover wolves into the Northern Rockies was estimated to be more than $150 million. What is the value of a wolf alive -- over the course of his or her lifetime -- compared to one-shot dead for a $19 wolf-hunting license? Ethics of recreational killing of wolves aside, economics does not justify this insanity. Moreover, trophy hunting of large carnivores can have many negative ecological repercussions as discussed in a new study in Biological Conservation.Members of Congress, predator friendly ranchers, respected scientists have spoken out publicly against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's proposal to remove federal protections for wolves arguing that delisting is premature and is not scientifically sound. The Service has extended the public comment period regarding their proposal to delist wolves from the ESA and has rescheduled public hearings.

The shelter named the three-year-old shaggy dog Leo. Something was clearly wrong with him. He could not walk. His front right leg seemed broken. When Love 4 Canines, an Orange County based rescue, pulled Leo from the shelter and had their own veterinarian look at him, they realized the truth was much worse than a broken bone. Leo had been shot twice. The bone was shattered.Throughout the veterinarian's examination, Leo remained calm and gentle even though he must have been going through intense pain. It was as though \"he knew he was being helped.\" When the poking and prodding finally ended, the agonizing truth about Leo's past slowly unfolded. Leo had extensive scarring around his neck, consistent with a collar that grew too tight. He had scarring all over his body measuring in length from one to three inches. But that wasn't the worst part. When the doctor X-rayed Leo's leg, the source of the limp was revealed. Two bullets still lodged in his flesh had shattered the leg. Lack of medical attention had forced the leg to start healing; improperly setting it so it could not handle any weight and was now a constant source of pain. It was speculated that by the amount of healing that had taken place, this intentional wound had occurred weeks to months prior.Laura Yeamen, owner and founder of Love 4 Canines rescue said, \"I have found that 99 percent of the dogs in the shelter are there because of their owner's issues.\" The one question everyone asks after looking at gentle-natured Leo is ... how? How could anyone shoot a dog twice?Leo's veterinarian recommended immediate amputation. On Monday, May 9, 2010, Leo underwent a life changing surgery. He no longer had pain from his injury and was re-learning how to walk on three legs. Laura knew that Leo would recover faster in a home rather than a hospital so she put the word out that Leo needed a home.Matt and Krista Parker adopted Leo that July. Matt had had experience with a \"tripod\" dog before so he was the perfect dad. But Leo didn't need the help. Soon after his surgery, he was \"sprinting faster than other dogs.\" According to Matt, Leo's personality is just that of a \"great dog that is such a sweetheart, a loving, kind soul.\"When Matt treated Leo to a kitten toy, instead of destroying it, Leo tended to it, protecting it as though he were caring for a real kitten. Leo has the instinct to protect the defenseless. And finally, Leo, has a family that will protect him too.Follow Love 4 Canines on FACEBOOK and visit their WEBSITE!Do you have a Tail of Hope or Survival? We'd love to hear it!

Kara Markell, pastor of Lake Washington Christian Church, recalled how \"unbreathable\" it often became inside her previous church in Texas.Sunday best, for some people, includes ample amounts of smell-nice. The idea that perfumes may pose health risks may never cross the mind.But nestled in the woods of a Seattle suburb, Markell's new parish offers a sanctuary from scents. A fragrance-free campaign asks members and visitors to forego perfumes, after-shave and scented lotions on Sundays. Meanwhile, the church is swapping out perfumed products throughout the building, including cleaners, candles, air fresheners and bathroom soaps.\"I love it,\" said Markell. Cleaner air that gives a reprieve to chemical-sensitive churchgoers ties in with her congregation's \"green church\" designation as well as its position on \"inclusion.\"Centuries of men and women have sought out sweet scents for the pleasure of themselves and others. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than a church sanctuary filled with fragrant candles and a cocktail of colognes. As a verse in the Bible's book of Proverbs reads, \"Ointment and perfume delight the heart.\"But at the time the Bible was written, scents were basic, like pure frankincense and myrrh. Today, they're likely an undisclosed mixture of petrochemicals. Modern chemical fragrances are also incorporated into a long list of products, from detergents and deodorants to dryer sheets and hair sprays.  The pervasiveness of synthetic scents, according to experts, threatens the health of many people -- whether they realize it or not. While a small fraction of Americans are hypersensitive to scents, many may be subtly affected and at increased risk of future health problems from living in an invisible fog of chemicals. Fragrance is just one piece of the problem, they say, with chemical ingredients that can include carcinogens, neurotoxins and hormone disruptors.\"Almost everything we use has chemical scent added,\" said Joseph Heimlich, an expert in environmental education and community involvement at The Ohio State University.\"What does clean smell like? It doesn't,\" Heimlich added. \"But we've been conditioned through media and society that it should smell like lemons or mountain fresh.\"The fragrance industry asserts the benefits of scents, whether natural, man-made, or designed to smell like nature.\"These products contribute to our overall quality of life and well-being,\" Elena Solovyov, a spokeswoman for the International Fragrance Association, an industry trade group, told The Huffington Post.\"Consumers can be assured that the fragrance used in their favorite products is safe,\" Solovyov said, noting that individual ingredients are \"evaluated for consumer and environmental safety\" and that products are \"tested according to all government and company-specific requirements.\" The fragrance industry sets its own standards and facilitates its own safety reviews, with help from outside experts.That's little comfort for people who find it unbearable to venture inside churches, workplaces, schools, or even the grocery store.\"There are people out there who would like to go to church, but they can't,\" said Gina Blum, an elder at Lake Washington Christian Church, who spent weeks compiling a list of products and their disclosed ingredients to help identify the safest alternatives for the church and its members.Blum said she is mildly sensitive to scents. Linda Moreno, another member with mild sensitivity, said her daughter, Kelsey, 22, can't even walk past someone wearing perfume on the street without getting sick.Moreno called Kelsey's hypersensitivity multiple chemical sensitivity -- a controversial condition. The American Medical Association studied it in 1991, but \"found no scientific evidence that supports the contention that multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a significant cause of disease,\" R.J. Mills, an AMA spokesperson, told HuffPost.Until \"accurate, reproducible, and well-controlled studies are available,\" Mills said, the AMA believes that \"multiple chemical sensitivity should not be considered a recognized syndrome.\"Dr. Philip Ranheim, an environmental medicine doctor based in Lake Stevens, Wash., who has dealt with chemical sensitivity issues himself, said the controversy will likely continue.\"There's not a lot of money and time and effort going into defining it more fully,\" said Ranheim, who attends a church unable to address his condition.\"Other countries such as England and Japan have had government-associated environmental centers for studying chemical sensitivity. But there's bias against it in this country,\" Ranheim added. \"I think we're addicted to chemicals and some people don't want to admit there's a downside to it.\"A review of research published in May concluded that one significant exposure, or the accrual of repeated low-level exposures, seems to overload and impair the body's ability to tolerate chemicals. At that point, \"minute amounts of diverse everyday chemicals\" can trigger symptoms. The larger the total body burden of toxins, suggests the review, the greater the degree of hypersensitivity.Studies in the early 2000s estimated that 12 percent to 16 percent of Americans are hypersensitive to chemicals.\"I think the numbers are increasing. It's becoming an epidemic,\" said Anne Steinemann, a co-author on one of those studies and a visiting researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.Her response when she first heard of Lake Washington Christian Church's campaign to address chemical sensitivity: \"Hallelujah.\"\"To some extent, we're all affected by chemicals,\" Steinemann added.In fact, those with acute symptoms, such as migraine headaches, asthma attacks, heart palpitations or skin rashes after exposures, may act as proverbial canaries in the coal mine when it comes to toxic chemicals and their subtle or future effects on others, according to some experts interviewed by HuffPost.But avoiding chemical fragrances, they added, is made difficult by their pervasiveness and by scant regulation.Solovyov, the fragrance industry spokeswoman, confirmed there is \"no official definition\" for the industry terms \"unscented\" or \"fragrance-free.\" The former can include fragrance ingredients that actually mask odors. She also said fragrance formulas are protected as \"trade secrets.\" Ingredients are rarely disclosed.Even full disclosure of chemicals \"offers little information on their ultimate toxicity,\" according to Steinemann.\"The solution is to use truly natural or simple products -- like our grandparents used -- vinegar, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, lemon juice (from a real lemon),\" she said.\"People with fragrance sensitivities usually don't react to aromatic flowers, fruits, or other truly natural smells,\" added Steinemann. \"It's often claimed that fragrance chemicals, such as limonene, are 'natural.' But there is a difference between the limonene as found in an orange and limonene made in a lab.\"Janine Ridings of Bellevue, Wash., became housebound after an extreme exposure to jet fuel fumes in 1998. A short while later, she began an online prayer group, Aroma of Christ, to provide fellowship and encouragement for others dealing with multiple chemical sensitivity. Ridings said she has been fortunate that a couple local churches accommodated her needs with everything from fragrance-free, windowed rooms outside the sanctuary to air freshener-free restrooms.\"If churches could just get air fresheners out of restrooms, that would help a lot,\" she said.Lake Washington Christian Church made that step. And the church's fragrance-free efforts continue. This month, the church held a screening of the environmental documentary, \"Chemerical,\" which explores the dangers of chemicals to clean our bodies and homes, and offers recipes for toxic-free alternatives.The film's producer, Andrew Nisker, recommended first targeting laundry and dishwashing detergents, which he suggested have some of the worst health and environmental impacts.Nisker has produced a cookbook of make-your-own cleaning products. The Environmental Working Group, meanwhile, offers a free database and guides to help identify the least toxic and fragrance-free personal care and cleaning products on the market.\"Policy is not going to change unless people change, and stop buying products full of toxins,\" Nisker told HuffPost.Consumer pressure may be responsible for announcements this fall from Target and Walmart. Both big box stores said they will begin rating products based on suspect chemicals. This week, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Lysol, Woolite and Airwick, reported plans to disclose chemicals in its fragrances.Raising awareness in the religious community may be a powerful avenue for further change, said Nisker. \"A lot of politics, whether we like it or not, has influenced policy for good or for bad. And there's a lot of religion in politics,\" he said.Ohio State's Heimlich agreed that churches are key venues for environmental progress.\"Churches are often a place where people are paying attention to things they may not pay attention to elsewhere,\" Heimlich said. \"If something comes to them from the pulpit, or the alter -- from that authority -- they'll hear it in a way they won't hear it from newspaper, radio, TV or from someone else.\"\"Also, in a religious community, you are caring about the other people in that community,\" Heimlich added. \"Cleaning your environment cleans it for everyone else too.\""}, {"title": "'Crazy Ants' Spreading Throughout Gulf Coast, Defying Extermination", "text": "By Andrea LorenzHOUSTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Every few days, Joe Stuckey unleashes chemicals on the legions of tiny ants that invade his home and swarm over his 40-acre property south of Houston. Once they die, he scoops them up by the shovel-full. Then he repeats the ritual.\"It's literally a huge problem,\" said Stuckey, a Houston environmental attorney.Stuckey is one of several landowners who allow researchers to use their property to learn more about tawny crazy ants, a nuisance spreading rapidly across the U.S. Gulf Coast.Originally from South America, the ants were discovered in Texas in 2002, and there have been confirmed sightings in at least four other states - Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. They are \"within four miles of Alabama right now,\" according to research scientist Joe MacGown at the Mississippi Entomological Museum.The good news: Tawny crazy ants do not sting or bite like fire ants, which have been around since the 1970s.The bad news: Tawny ants multiply very quickly and like to make their home in warm, tight spaces including around electrical equipment, under floorboards and in car engines.Large swarms of the ants have been found in the mall area of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, although they have not done any significant damage, said NASA Houston Facilities Management and Operations Chief Shelia Powell in an email.\"We are principally concerned about the possible damage to infrastructure such as electronics, employees' automobiles, and our facilities,\" Powell said.NASA uses a local extermination company, which has come up with a temporary strategy using frequent application of multiple products to kill them, she said.Still, not enough is known about their physiology to predict how far north or inland they will travel, and how best to eliminate them, experts said.\"You almost have to see it to believe what a nuisance these can become,\" said Robert Puckett, an associate research scientist at Texas A&M University. \"I've been in people's houses where they show me trash bags full of ants they've swept up.\"Diana Tahtinen, who owns a home south of Houston, estimates having spent about $1,000 a year for pest control during the last three years of battling the ants on her land.\"It has a huge impact on your quality of life,\" she said.The ants hitch rides in landscaping and building materials and even on shoes or cars, which is common for invasive species, said David Oi, a research entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Although financial losses have not officially been tallied, Tom Rasberry, a Houston exterminator credited by local experts with discovering the ants in the U.S., believes that the costs over a decade of damage could be in the hundreds of millions.State and federal funds to combat the ants have been slow in coming, Puckett said. But Texas A&M has several projects in the works to learn more about the ants, thanks partly to state funding formerly reserved for fire ants that has now been opened up to tawny crazy ants.Traditional extermination chemicals do not seem to work.\"You can spray and it will kill tens of thousands, but they come back,\" said Stuckey. \"If you took a restaurant-sized pepper jug and poured it on the floor, that's how thick they are.\"\"This year's been the worst ever.\" (Editing by Greg McCune and Gunna Dickson)"}, {"title": "Giant, Floating Whale Carcass Could Attract Sharks Close To Hawaii Shore", "text": "The 30-40 foot sperm whale carcass currently floating off Oahu's windward shore \"kind of looked like Swiss cheese,\" according to Brad Peebles of Badbury Photography.The decomposing whale has already attracted its fair share of hungry fish and sharks. \"It had a bunch of holes in it,\" Peebles told Hawaii News Now. \"The stomach had been eaten out, you can see some ribs poking out. It was a pretty interesting scene.\"While captivating, the scene has Hawaii officials panicked. The carcass is only 5 miles from a popular recreational site, Kaneohe Bay, and it's moving quickly. Officials' fear is two-fold: that the carcass will continue to lure hungry sharks closer to shore, and that the carcass itself will eventually reach shore, requiring heavy equipment and strong stomachs to haul it away.For now, scientists and the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources are waiting to see where the carcass ends up. About four sperm whale carcasses drift towards shore every year in Hawaii, but it's nearly impossible to tell how they died."}, {"title": "Tangled Eagles Rescued After Talons Get Stuck Together (PHOTO)", "text": "Double-headed eagles are a common theme on royal crests, having represented everything from the Byzantine emperors to the Russian Empire.But as wildlife officers in Loudoun County, Va., now know, the regal caricature doesn't represent the reality all that well.

The other is expected to be fully healed in the near future.According to the American Eagle Foundation, eagles have been known to lock talons on occasion, particularly when fighting.While the exact circumstances surrounding these two birds of prey are not available, mating eagles specifically have been known to engage in a practice called \"cartwheeling,\" wherein potential mates lock talons, then tumble to the earth at a high speed. They disengage from one another at the last moment and fly off.According to National Geographic, bald eagles were once considered an endangered species, but they have \"rebounded significantly\" and are now classified as \"threatened.\" The animals are particularly sensitive to toxins that collect in fish, which constitute much of their diet."}, {"title": "R-R- Redundancy -- a New 'R' To Heed", "text": "At lunch yesterday a colleague asked me what I thought about 'Resilience' as a alternative term for sustainability. I responded that I was still trying to figure out if I liked 'Flourishing'. But I had no doubt at all about a term I coined myself recently - 'R-R- Redundancy Avoidance'. First, a definition.\"R-R- Redundancy\" Defined R-R- Redundancy is what lets me close my apartment door and 'flourish' without speaking to my neighbors behind all the other doors down the sixth floor hallway of my Upper East Side co-op for an entire weekend or week if I choose. That's because in my large one-bedroom apartment (neatly divided into six 'rooms' - living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, office and bathroom), I have what real estate agents refer to as all the amenities - the kitchen with the gleaming white Whirlpool fridge, the GE stove and microwave, the black 'Alfredo Accu-time' toaster oven, the Krups drip coffeemaker with thermal carafe, and the Whirlpool 'QuietPower3' dishwasher.Not One, but Two TVs... In that same apartment are not one but two TVs with remote controls (which I sheepishly admit to running simultaneously when I'm cleaning), a Marantz stereo system with two sets of speakers (one set for the bedroom, the other, the living room) and two Panasonic DVDs and VCRs, one set for each TV.Then there's the three Apple MacBooks in the 'office' -- one for me, one for my assistant and a more or less retired spare. We also have an old HP Laserwriter printer, an old Brother fax  machine, two GE landline phone sets, a Panasonic cordless phone, and an Apple iphone 4. And just recently when the printer started to act up and the copier died, we got a brand new Brother MFS MulitFunction Center which houses a color laser printer, fax, copier and scanner in one.In the linen closet, nestled within the sheets and towels and assorted household 'stuff', there's an $850 Electrolux canister vacuum-cleaner with any number of plastic-y attachments I've yet to use. There's also a spiffy Norelco 'Ultima 80' iron that whistles when I'm away for it for too long, and an ironing board with a really nice cotton cover with a pocket underneath that allows me to store an ironing cloth.One Person With A Lot of Stuff It's not relevant that the fridge isn't a Sub-Zero, the TVs aren't high-def flat-screens mounted to the wall, or the coffeemaker isn't a Keurig one-cupper. I think you're getting the picture.And things would be 'worse' if I owned a car, a boat, and a weekend place in Connecticut. Suffice it to say, for global comparison, I'm one person and despite my best efforts to live simply, I've got a lot of 'stuff''.Trouble is, all of my neighbors behind those eleven doors down the hallway have exactly the same things -- as do all the neighbors on the other twelve floors in our building. And some of them not only have Sub-Zero fridges and wall-mounted TVs, they also have a car, likely a Mercedes or BMW, in our building's garage, a weekend place in Connecticut, and/or an apartment in Florida with a matched set of the exact same amenities.What Were We Thinking? Someday I fear that we will all look back with horror (that is, if we and our kids and grandkids are still here) and say 'What were we thinking?'Most Americans haven't given a moment's thought to any of the implications of owning all of these sometimes multiple possessions in every house across our land, their embodied materials and energy, the space the vacuum hogs on the floor of the linen closet, or the time involved in shopping, maintaining, and repairing them.Not because they are selfish or mean. Not because they believe they 'worked hard' for them. But because owning a full complement of possessions behind one door (or under one roof) is part of our consumerist society. We value independence from tyrants and zealots as well as from neighbors bearing empty sugar bowls.How I Practice R-R- Redundancy Avoidance Now that I've awakened from my independent possession-owning-maintaining-inventorying stupor (and in a city and country where the costs of doing same are starting to escalate), I've started to take some steps to avoid r-r- redundancy in my own life.Share the Newspaper My next door neighbor, Marlene gets the Wall Street Journal and I get the NY Times deliveredeach morning. As soon as we're finished reading them (usually by 9 am), we simply open our doors and with one flick of our wrists, toss our papers in front of the other's door. (Sometimes I add a stage whispered, 'Paper!') in case she's sitting, per usual, at her desk just inside.) It might have the occasional article clipped out, but heck, the price is right, and the convenience can't be beat, and of course, at the end of the day, it saves a heck of a lot of paper.Take a Book, Leave a Book One 'garbage night' ten years ago, my equally green-aware super and I dragged in an abandoned shelf system from down the block, and instantly set up a 'Take a Book, Leave a Book' in our basement laundry room (the laundry room being a good, albeit passive source of r-r- redundancy avoidance thanks to building codes).Neighbors (some of whom likely never met) anonymously exchange books, enhancing each other's minds, lives and pocketbooks.Share the Vacuum Cleaner I learned from my Bissell client that the average vacuum cleaner is used for 20 minutes every other week. (Because of this, vacuums use so little cumulative energy, another client, Energy Star doesn't even have a rating for them.) Given this, just one vacuum cleaner could literally rotate through every apartment in my building every two weeks -- with nary a dust ball in sight.A Sharing Closet? I've even started to wish for a little closet down the hall (right near a hopefully soon-to-be-obsolete compactor room) stocked with a vacuum-cleaner, an ironing board, popcorn maker, espresso-maker, and a coffee urn and proverbial punch bowl for the occasional party -- you're getting the picture. An opportunity for a budding entrepreneur? A building looking to distinguish itself among the luxury high rises? And shudder to think of it, middle class people looking to stay that way? Let's see...Now that I'm getting into this, I can't help asking: What other opportunities await for high rise neighbors to reduce r-r- redundancy by sharing, borrowing, and lending beyond the proverbial cup of sugar?Originally published on WeHateToWaste.com, the author's blog."}, {"title": "Chicken Jackets Class Up Rescued Birds (PHOTOS)", "text": "Even chickens are not immune to the winter cold.After rescuing two chickens from a battery farm, one couple in the U.K. needed to come up with a way to keep their new pets from freezing in their backyard over the next few months.

While some egg-laying hens are given free range to move around, the vast majority of chickens are held in tight battery cages and subjected to cruel conditions. Since such a high number of egg farms cage their chickens, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recommends that consumers avoid buying eggs or try egg alternatives."}, {"title": "Sydney Schools Los Angeles on Sustainability", "text": "By Mark Gold and Jon ChristensenLos Angeles could learn a lot by looking across the Pacific for lessons on how to move quickly towards energy and water sustainability and reduce its carbon footprint. Allan Jones, an environmental engineer who led London's efforts to cope with climate change and has been doing the same now in Sydney for the past four years, recently visited UCLA to share Sydney's formula for success.The Institute of the Environment and Sustainability brought Jones to UCLA for our Oppenheim Lecture series. Click here to listen to a podcast of the lecture, download a PDF of Jones's presentation, and find links to Jones's plans for Sydney.Sydney's goals are nothing less than 100 percent renewable energy and 100 percent local water supply. And Jones is putting Sydney on a fast track to reach these goals through a combination of public-private partnerships and new policies. Sydney's sustainable city plan calls for a 70 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. And their green infrastructure plan--which features decentralized \"trigeneration\" plants (which generate electricity, heating, and cooling), renewable energy sources, advanced solid waste treatment (to convert waste to energy), and decentralized water treatment (to re-use wastewater)--is a blueprint for how to achieve these audacious goals in other cities, such as Los Angeles.What is most striking about Jones's approach is that it doesn't rely on new technological breakthroughs. It is a common sense approach based on collecting and analyzing energy and water data at the parcel scale--something UCLA's California Center for Sustainable Communities is working on for LA--and then using that information to develop planning strategies and deploy today's leading edge technologies across the city at all scales from individual buildings to neighborhoods and municipal systems.Sydney has already started creating thermal networks in neighborhoods to reduce heating and cooling costs through the use of the heat released from trigeneration plants. The city is now starting to treat wastewater and reuse it. But unlike other cities, Sydney is not treating the water to drinking water standards since people actually only drink about 2 percent of the water they normally use and it's very expensive to meet drinking water standards. Instead, Sydney is treating the water for use in dual plumbing systems that separate drinking water from other water uses. The treated wastewater is used for flushing toilets, air conditioning, and landscape watering. At this rate, Sydney may rarely if ever use a white elephant ocean desalination facility that it built during an eight-year-long drought, because the city's stalwart conservation efforts and increased water reuse may provide all the water the city now needs. And if they ever do flip the switch on desal, Jones wants the plant to be powered by the excess heat generated at an adjacent power plant, not by electricity.One key to Jones's strategy is relying on renewable gases to provide the bulk of Sydney's energy needs. These renewable gases will come from technologies that have been used in Germany for years to turn solid waste into energy. Jones also wants to use renewable energy to create gas through water electrolysis. Imagine a wind turbine or solar panels generating energy to run electrolysis units to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases from water. The hydrogen is then pumped into the existing natural gas distribution system (natural gas can run as high as 20 percent hydrogen and still be safe). In essence, the hydrogen gas serves as a battery that stores renewable energy for use when you need it, not just when it is sunny or windy. Also, it is cheaper and more efficient to transport energy through pipelines than transmit electricity through wires.Jones brings a pragmatic business sense to these audacious efforts. His success is based on local government partnerships with private companies. He started out by persuading the biggest landlords in Sydney to enter into \"environmental upgrade agreements\" that enabled landlords to make their buildings more energy and water efficient at a low cost by reducing the costs of financing improvements. Banks invested in the approach because they knew the local government was a partner in the efforts and because they were financing whole groups of buildings, not just one building at a time. Less risk led to greater investor confidence. The city also partnered with a private gas utility to distribute the renewable gases the city generates. Jones's goal is for all of Sydney's natural gas to come from renewable gases--a far cry from our own current approach here in LA where 60 percent of our gas comes from fracking.Visiting with Jones convinced us that urban sustainability isn't some utopian pipedream. It can happen in the near future and it can happen cost effectively. The hardest part isn't developing the technologies. Most of them exist today. The hardest part is that we need public support and local and state government leadership to eliminate legal obstacles and construct the necessary economic and policy incentives to catalyze the urban transformation we desperately need to make LA sustainable.An earlier version of this blog post was published in our column \"Christensen and Gold\" at LA Observed."}, {"title": "Can a Wind Turbine Kill You?", "text": "Probably not, but people have claimed that they make them sick.Some as tall as a 20-story building with a blade span of 200 feet, the monster windmills are obviously a menacing sight.I first saw wind turbines in a vast field on an empty Australian cliff decades ago. The tall white bird-like structures were gigantic and silent, rolling in the wind with endless motion. They looked so peaceful and so innocent; I was convinced then that they were the future of energy for our world.We since tried solar, nuclear, electric and water energy sources. Why is it that none of these take for good? We are still breathing through pollution smog and choking the planet under cloaks of bad air. So what is wrong with the wind?According to a lawsuit filed by some residents of a Cape Cod town last week, many side effects of the three giant wind turbines near their homes are felt by the population on the island. Is it just a small annoyance, or a real threat to health?Their claims cover troubles such as migraines and tinnitus (unbearable ringing inside the ears), dizziness and insomnia. Maybe the fact that the turbines are so close to the houses, 1,600 feet for one of them, is the reason for the maladies. Even though they are silent from afar, there is a definite humming when you stand too close.A lot of people within one mile of the spinning rotors are getting sick and moving away from their homes, claiming toxic sound environment. On another hand, the turbines installed there have prevented 7,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions from other form of power. We sometimes have to pick and choose.It's been also reported that the wind machines were killing birds, which became disoriented in flight by the unnatural structures, getting hit by the long and powerful arms. It seems that some species of birds have since adapted to the strangers on their land, and are now avoiding the invaders quite skillfully, passing on to the next generation the lesson learned.I still like the wind energy better than gas or oil sources. The fact that the blades can be installed practically anywhere could reduce our dependency on foreign countries for energy supply. Wind power requires zero fuel and zero water usage.As of today, there are 225,000 large wind turbines in 79 countries, and 656,000 smaller ones. Germany leads by number, then Spain, the United States, India, and Denmark. Some industry experts predict that by 2050 a third of the world's electricity will be produced by wind turbines. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is more conservative with a number closer to 18 percent.Australia has been actively developing the newer energy source, not only because of the empty spaces the country offers for the farms to be installed, but also because its population has always been very open to green technology, and will do whatever is necessary to be at the forefront of ecology implementation.Vestas, the Danish company that started wind harvesting over 30 years ago, has 49,000 operating turbines on the planet; see the very interesting video demonstration on their website.I wonder what Don Quixote would have said when butting against one of the giant windmills of nowadays!

This week, a 45-year-old man was swimming 50 yards offshore when an aggressive reef shark grabbed him. He was able to elbow and kick the shark away, but in August Jana Lutteropp was not so lucky.

Well online ads don\u2019t know Stiv Wilson.The communications director for the environmental nonprofit 5 Gyres was perusing Facebook last week when an ad for SoBe bottled drinks popped up on his feed.Send a message in a bottle and win a Hawaiian vacation, the ad encouraged.Wilson was horrified. \u201cAt first, I thought they were actually advocating for people to throw plastic bottles into the ocean,\u201d Wilson wrote in a 5 Gyres blog, partially entitled \u201c#TheyJustDon\u2019tGetIt.\u201dA look at SoBe\u2019s website lays out the promotion in more detail. Visitors are encouraged to \u201cexplore the worlds of Sobe\u201d and write a message inspired by the images. Share the message via social media and be entered to win prizes.Well, the worlds one can explore are scenes of plastic SoBe bottles floating in the ocean......and waterfalls......and stuck in the sand on tropical beaches.\u201cHow odd and insensitive a choice it is to use plastic pollution in the ocean portrayed in a positive, paradise like fashion,\u201d Wilson writes.It\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s bothered by this image, considering 5 Gyres\u2019 entire mission is to \u201cconduct research and communicate about the global impact of plastic pollution in the world\u2019s oceans and employ strategies to eliminate the accumulation of plastic pollution in the 5 subtropical gyres.\u201dThe organization tours the five ocean gyres which, due to currents and the earth\u2019s rotation, amass a huge portion of the plastic that ends up in the world\u2019s waters. They conduct research on and take inventory of the waste they observe, and document the effects on marine life.In case you hadn\u2019t heard (which perhaps SoBe has not), ocean plastic pollution is an enormous problem. 5 Gyres estimates that the world only recycles about 5% of the plastic it uses. The rest ends up in landfills or is even less-properly discarded, eventually winding up in the ocean. As it (very) slowly biodegrades, it breaks into pieces small enough for marine life to ingest, leaching toxic compounds in the meantime.\u201cWhen marine animals consume plastic trash, presumably mistaking it for food, this can lead to internal blockages, dehydration, starvation, and potentially death. Also of deep concern for societies are the potential human health impacts of toxic chemicals entering the marine food chain through plastics,\u201d 5 Gyres warns.SoBe\u2019s products used to be distributed in glass bottles, but the Pepsi-owned company now uses plastic. So the concept of an ad depicting plastic bottles in the ocean, and figuratively encouraging the practice of throwing a bottle into the ocean with a message inside, is rather baffling.In the end, Wilson puts the responsibility on himself and other like-minded anti-plastic crusaders. \u201cWhat saddens me is this -- if no one is catching that this ad campaign was a dumb idea, it means we as activists need to turn the volume up.

The new policies have confused solar companies, left hundreds of customers who were in the middle of the installation process in limbo and cut deeply into solar sales at what is normally the busiest time of year.Describing the new sales tactics that have emerged, Chris DeBone, co-owner of Hawaii Energy Connection in Honolulu, said, \u201cWe have heard every horror story in the books.\u201dHECO's changes mean that solar customers on Oahu now face the possibility \u2014 or, depending on where they are located, the likelihood \u2014 of long delays and added costs that could reach into the thousands of dollars to get their system hooked up to HECO\u2019s electric grid.But not all salespeople are clear with new customers about the challenges they may face in switching to solar. Some sales agents, according to numerous reports, are blatantly deceiving customers. One solar vendor is falsely claiming that it has an agreement with the utility that exempts its customers from studies and upgrades, according to HECO.Other agents have been pushing customers to sign up for solar systems that may not get turned on by the utility anytime soon, if ever. In certain cases, such actions are already leaving residents essentially paying two electricity bills \u2014 one to HECO, another for monthly payments for their solar system that was supposed to cancel out the traditional electric bill, but isn\u2019t.In response to an increasing number of reports of unethical business practices, HECO sent a letter to solar contractors this week to detail the alleged transgressions and to ask the perpetrators to stop.\u201cPractices like this put the safety of utility workers and customers at risk and harm the reputation of the solar industry,\u201d Jim Alberts, a HECO vice president wrote. \u201cYour customers are our customers. Please help us to ensure they\u2019re fully informed about what may be involved for them to safely interconnect their PV systems to the grid.\u201dSolar sales have exploded in the past couple of years. Nine percent of residential customers on Oahu now have solar panels on their roofs, according to HECO. But even as the utility leads the nation in the amount of solar installed per capita, it is running up against constraints on how much of the energy it can safely integrate into its electric grid without causing power outages or voltage spikes that can harm consumer electronics or put workers at risk.Solar companies are now being told to submit what\u2019s called a \u201cnet energy metering agreement\u201d to the utility first, before proceeding with the installation process. Prior to the September 6 changes, this was usually the last step in a solar installation process that can take a couple of months.During that process, HECO reviews an agreement between a contractor and a customer that includes information about the size and location of the solar system. If the system is in an area where the amount of solar on a circuit falls below a pre-designated threshold, HECO tells the contractor to proceed and guarantees that the system will be hooked up to its electric grid hassle-free.But for systems in areas where the concentration of solar is already high, customers are told that they could face long delays and added costs while HECO studies its grid to determine if technological upgrades are needed in order to handle more solar.HECO's changes are causing some sales agents to panic, while some companies simply aren't following the new rules.Aaron Kirk, chief operating officer at Sunetric, told Civil Beat last week that the company doesn't always submit a net energy metering agreement to the utility first. Instead, the company checks HECO\u2019s solar saturation map to see if a customer is in an area where there is enough circuit space. If so, the company tells customers it is safe to go ahead and install solar.Such an approach is problematic, in part because it can take weeks before a solar system gets hooked up to the electric grid, and by that time conditions may have changed.The maps or a phone call to HECO provide a preliminary check on a circuit, said HECO spokesman, Peter Rosegg, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee that the customer will have a spot on the grid.The \u201cstatus of circuits can change quickly,\u201d Rosegg said by email. \u201cTo guarantee a place on a circuit, customers must have submitted a completed application and received a written notice of acceptance.\u201dMark Duda, an executive at RevoluSun, noted, \u201cThe map doesn\u2019t really tell you what is going on. There are piles of submitted applications that are not reflected in the map.\u201dThe Analog Meter TrickNormally, HECO has to give a customer a special meter in order for their solar system to work. The meter spins backwards when a customer is feeding solar electricity into the grid, which reduces or cancels out their electricity bill.But this leads to a potential problem. Since it is possible to turn a solar system on so that old analog meters \u2014 as opposed to next-generation digital meters \u2014 will spin backwards to take in energy, lowering energy bills, it's an incentive for people to go ahead and install solar without permission from HECO. DeBone notes that, \"It's not legal,\" but that doesn't mean that some people aren't doing it. If HECO switches people who are doing this to a digital meter, the customer's electricity bill can double because the meter would record both the solar energy being generated and the electricity that the customer is drawing from the electric grid.\u201cThe storm is just brewing for the people doing this,\u201d DeBone said.Phantom Customers Squat the Solar QueueThe solar industry is, in some cases, also undermining itself.Bryan Clark, a solar consultant for Solar Wave, said that he\u2019s been submitting net metering agreements to the utility even in cases when the customer hasn\u2019t signed on for a solar system. In fact, he said, \u201cMore don\u2019t have a deal than do.\u201dClark said the practice has become common within the industry in recent weeks and that he has also oversized the systems in case a customer decides they want more panels.\u201cNinety-five percent of sales are on commission,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you get a signed contract, you get half the commission.\u201dCommissions vary per company, but the practice is also a way of staking out space in the solar queue. Even if a customer isn\u2019t signing on to solar now, it\u2019s a way of getting them in line \u2014 in case they want it later \u2014 before circuits fill up.Rosegg said that it\u2019s difficult to figure out how common such practices have become in recent weeks.But if solar contractors are rushing to get \u201cphantom\u201d customers into the solar lineup or if they are speculating on selling bigger systems, this is bad news for solar industry, said DeBone.\u201cIt just screws more and more customers out of getting net energy metering agreements,\u201d he said.A Path ForwardOahu residents wanting to switch to solar are all of a sudden facing restrictions and added costs. But customers on Maui and the Big Island have been dealing with these challenges for several years.Many of the consumer abuses that are happening on Oahu could be eliminated if HECO followed the policy of its subsidiary, Maui Electric Co., said Marco Mangelsdorf, president of ProVision Solar on the Big Island.On Maui, the county won\u2019t issue a permit for a solar system unless it has an approval letter from the utility.The policy safeguards customers by forcing contractors to submit the net metering agreement to the utility first. On Oahu, the policy is currently voluntary.\u201cEven if 90 percent of contractors play by the rules, there\u2019s still going to be a percentage of contractors desperate for sales who will move forward with permitting and the installation of a system that may or may not be interconnected in a timely fashion,\u201d said Mangelsdorf. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to be a nightmare for HECO.\u201dBut apparently HECO executives, who have known for months about the changes, tried to implement the MECO policy on Oahu.Rosegg said that the utility is only in preliminary discussions with Honolulu\u2019s Department of Planning and Permitting.DPP says that for now it\u2019s not on board with the policy. \u201cThe Department of Planning and Permitting had concerns over how this would impact our permit processing procedures, and we did not want to change these procedures based on issues HECO had with its customers,\u201d Art Challacombe, the department\u2019s deputy director told Civil Beat in a statement. \u201cThe DPP hopes that HECO can resolve these issues prior to continued discussions.\u201dChallacombe declined an interview request and did not respond to questions from Civil Beat asking him to elaborate on what issues HECO needs to resolve with its customers first.DeBone, whose company also operates on Maui, said that the permitting policy slows things down, but ultimately protects the consumer.Read HECO's letter to solar contractors here."}, {"title": "Farm-to-Institution: Next Steps in Supporting Local Food Infrastructure", "text": "As summer shifts into the colder seasons, gardeners in the Northeast turn to the age old traditions of preserving and extending the life of food; Fruit gives way to jam, tomatoes become sauce, vegetables are pickled, relished and frozen. Seasonality, and our responses to it, may be the single most defining characteristic of local food. And, methods of processing, preserving and adding value are emerging as an important part of the opportunity and challenge of increasing local purchases, especially to buyers beyond individual households, into wholesale and institutional markets.Selling to institutions is a trending opportunity for local food. It is estimated that 99 percent of agricultural products consumed in the U.S. is purchased through wholesale channels. A recent USDA report estimates that tens of millions of people eat their meals outside of the home environment each day. The combined meal service potential of schools, colleges, hospitals, corporations and government agencies represents a huge opportunity for local farmers, ranchers and local food entrepreneurs to, \"gain market share, earn a livelihood, forge ties with local residents, and improve community health and well-being through farm-to-institution efforts, in which local producers sell to institutions nearby.\"Yet, we have barely scratched the surface of potential for how wholesale markets could impact local foods sales and support farmers. It is a win-win opportunity. Still, there are some barriers to farm-to-institution, including: seasonality, availability and aggregating enough farm products from small to mid-sized farms. A response to this opportunity requires shifts in policy, infrastructure and education as we support growing urban and rural agricultural trends.Local food preservation has a long-standing tradition in New England and the Northeast. Reviving these traditions and bringing them to scale in order to encourage Farm-to-Institution sales and more direct supply chains will ensure future generations have local food access and elevate strong communities that support local farms and farmers."}, {"title": "Bob Barker's Secret To Leading A Fulfilling Life And Changing The World", "text": "Six years after ending a 35-year gig hosting \u201cThe Price Is Right,\u201d Bob Barker is still giving away money. But these days, it\u2019s animals on the receiving end.At 89, the celebrated game show host has made promoting animal welfare a full-time job, and he couldn\u2019t be happier. But the cause is nothing new to Barker, who launched the DJ&T Foundation in 1995 to subsidize spay/neuter clinics around the country, and has been actively involved with PETA, the Performing Animal Welfare Society, Animal Defenders International and Mercy for Animals.Most recently, with tears in his eyes, he welcomed three African elephants to a Northern California sanctuary after years of effort and a nearly $1 million donation to relocate them from the Toronto Zoo.Barker sat down with The Huffington Post to talk about his love for animals, why he wants to give away every last penny, and his main sidekick these days, Mister Rabbit.How did you become such an advocate for animal rights?  I am one of millions of people who was just born with a deep love of animals. I have been devoted to animals since I can remember. As a kid I picked up strays and tried in my clumsy ways to help injured animals. I\u2019ve done it all my life, and now I\u2019m doing it on a much larger scale.What are some of your proudest moments as an animal rights activist? When I stood and watched those three elephants from the Toronto Zoo come off the bus and arrive at the PAWS sanctuary. Another time, Animal Defenders International was trying to get Bolivia to pass a bill that would prevent circuses from appearing in the country if they had any animals at all, and eventually we got that bill passed. But then there were 84 lions that had to be transferred out of Bolivia and into the U.S., and I paid for that. I went to Denver to welcome the lions, and they\u2019re in a sanctuary there now. I felt just as joyous at the site of those beautiful lions as I did when I saw those elephants.It sounds like devoting yourself to something you\u2019re passionate about has been quite fulfilling. Any time an animal can be helped anywhere in any way, it pleases me. I\u2019ve had a wonderful life doing something I thoroughly enjoy on TV and being well-paid for it, but rather than just writing a will and leaving money to be distributed after my death, I decided to start giving it away. I would recommend that to other people; give your money away while you\u2019re still alive. If you can afford it, I would recommend you check out your local organizations, choose carefully and make some contributions. If you are able to physically go to your local organization and volunteer, they all need help, and I think that you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s very satisfying.That must take up a lot of your time. How does it feel to stay so active? It keeps you sharp, mentally. I\u2019m on the phone with someone, or I\u2019m writing something or I\u2019m reading something. It\u2019s a work of love, and its good for me. I think that people who retire and decide to sit and watch television are making a terrible mistake.When you do need a break, how do you like to unplug and recharge? I rest. I\u2019ll be 90 next month and am still really healthy for my age, but when I came home from this trip to the PAWS sanctuary, I was tired. I just rested for a day or two and this morning I did a full workout with 20 minutes on the elliptical and light weights, and I feel great.What\u2019s your secret to living well at 90? If you don\u2019t eat properly and you don\u2019t exercise, you ain\u2019t going to enjoy the golden years.Any animals keeping you company at home? Right now I have only one animal, but he\u2019s a very special one. He\u2019s Mister Rabbit. My housekeeper was coming to work one morning, and there was this baby rabbit just sitting outside in the cold yard. She picked him up and brought him here to me. I was still doing \u201cPrice\u201d so I talked around with people on the show about giving him away, but people wanted to put him in a cage, so I kept him. The vet said the average age was four to six years and sometimes 10. Mister Rabbit is now 10-and-a-half and he still runs all over the house."}, {"title": "Cooking as the Cornerstone of a Sustainable Food System", "text": "\"How cool is this!\"Susan, a 68-year-old retiree from Philadelphia, was on her maiden voyage with her new toy, a salad spinner.As she pulled the spinner's retractable cord, the room filled with a rattling hum, similar to a washing machine at the end of its cycle. She was visibly pleased that after just a few pulls, the lettuce leaves tucked inside the colander-like basket were nice and dry. She marveled at how she could both wash -- \"Wow, there's a lot of dirt in these leaves\" -- and dry salad greens with just one tool.This was just one of the many ah-ha moments for Susan, who signed on to take an immersion cooking course with me earlier this summer. Over the course of a week, we met in her kitchen each day with one primary objective: Getting a handle on the bare essentials of cooking.With beautifully washed and dried greens before us, the next logical step was to make some salad dressing. She could hardly fathom, as with the salad spinner, the low-tech simplicity of the DIY version. Surely there was more to salad dressing than a few tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, and maybe a smidge of strong mustard. \"That's it -- and you just shake it all together in a little jar?\"You see, during the twenty-plus years of raising three children, Susan put dinner on the table with minimal chopping, slicing or dicing. Instead, she opened cans, unsealed jars and unzipped seasoning envelopes, as per the directions on the back of a box, and within minutes, voila, dinner was ready. With so many heat, reheat and quick-serve options on supermarket shelves,  Susan, a young mother of three in 1971, felt no need to learn how to use a kitchen knife, and it certainly never occurred to her to make salad dressing. In her mind, Susan fulfilled her job of putting a hot meal on the table for her family. Nobody ever starved, she noted.Susan is right. Her kids did eat three \"square\" meals a day. But they each went out into the world without knowing how to prepare one.I should know; I'm her daughter.I was 21 when I graduated from college, the same age Susan was when she gave birth to me. With my first cookbook (The New Basics by Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso), I fumbled my way through my apartment kitchen. Cooking dinner, I quickly learned, was a practical way to stretch my measly paycheck. But it also set me on a path of personal discovery.Learning to cook reminds me of discovering my true love for reading, when I was six years old, the lucky recipient of a brand new hardbound copy of Charlotte's Web. Reading took me places I longed to go and helped me to better understand the world, even then.At the stove, my world similarly expanded. Even when I screwed up a dish, I learned something new: Maybe math or chemistry, botany or history, or a hard-fought lesson in patience. Looking back now, with the perspective that comes with a culinary degree and a 17-year food career, I still believe deep in my bones that cooking, which marries the practical with the magical, can be the greatest teacher of all, and that it's never too late to learn.It was in this spirit that I approached Susan about the kitchen project. Nothing too cheffy or complicated, I said to her over the phone. Simple tricks and techniques like washing and drying salad greens, and making legumes.Legumes. What are those?You know, lentils.Oh yes. And can we make some quinoa? I would like to learn how to make some quinoa salad. I love the one that's on the menu at Terrain.Sure. And maybe work on some knife skills, you know, how to dice and slice.Ugh, my knife is so dull. Maybe we need to buy a new knife.Our adventure began, as it did every day, with warm-up exercises that went something like this: \"Okay, ready? Heel, tip. Heel, tip. There you go. Glide, glide. Twenty times on each side.\"You might think we were working out to a Jane Fonda tape; instead we were honing our knives with a sharpening steel. A long metal rod used to maintain the edge of a knife, the steel is one of the first things I learned to use in culinary school, but rarely sees the light of day in home kitchens.By our fifth day, Susan had prepared two kinds of lentil dishes, boiled quinoa (\"wow, it took only 15 minutes!\"), seasoned it with her newly beloved salad dressing in a jar, and stuffed that quinoa into bell pepper halves. We bought just-harvested asparagris (her word) from a local farm stand that we roasted and topped with lemon zest and grated Parmigiano.I'm sure some of you are asking how this sweet little mother-daughter cooking story has any business appearing in a serious publication about the food system.The thing is, home cooking is serious business. The food system is more than crops and livestock; it's what we humans do with them. In these disheartening times, when we're asked to make sense of mega farms, antibiotic-resistant foodborne outbreaks and poverty-driven obesity, cooking is a beacon.Back in 1966, a woman named Margaret McNamara founded Reading is Fundamental (RIF), a nonprofit dedicated to eradicating illiteracy. RIF points out on its web site that \"Literacy -- the ability to read and write -- is essential to developing a sense of well-being and citizenship.\"Couldn't we say the same thing about the ability to prepare a simple meal? Cooking is as fundamental as it gets - to our personal health and nourishment, and to the well-being and longevity of our communities, culture and society. It can be the cornerstone of a sustainable food system, if we give it a chance.See you in the kitchen.This is an abridged version of this essay, which originally appeared on Civil Eats."}, {"title": "This Halloween: Bats Beware", "text": "Photo courtesy of: Dr. Jonathan Epstein, @EcoHealth AllianceContrary to creepy Halloween images of witches, ghosts and ghouls, one of the traditional icons of the season -- the bat -- deserves to be a star. For centuries, Chinese cultures regarded bats as the harbinger of good fortune and health, and in Chinese art a depiction of five bats is called \"Five blessings,\" long life, ease, wealth, joy and a natural death. We may lose these blessings soon because bats are disappearing at an alarming rate. They are persecuted, hunted for food and medicine by the hundreds of thousands, and their habitats are being destroyed. To make matters worse, a new disease named white nose syndrome, possibly introduced from Europe, has killed millions of bats in the U.S., wiped out entire colonies in the east and has now spread from New England to Canada and across the Mississippi.Admittedly, some tiny bats of the new world do indeed drink blood (though only three of the over 1200 bat species in the world do so) and they do have the ability to spread rabies when the disease is not controlled in domestic animals as it should be. In fact, domestic cows and domestic dogs were introduced to the new world by humans and thus created the unnatural contact that allowed rabies to spread. To a vampire bat foraging for food at night, a cow standing out in a field looks like an abandoned 500-pint blood donor bag. Similar unnatural animal contact happens in Asia. A SARS-like virus has been indentified from bats in China and scientists think that viruses jumped from bats to other wild animals in wildlife food markets and led to the SARS pandemic. The newly discovered coronavirus infecting humans in the Middle East is thought to come from bats, and several other viruses that are deadly to animals and humans are found in bats. As we look more closely at bats around the world, we continue to make new discoveries.But don't blame the bats for our health problems. Diseases like Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and rabies are a result of humans disturbing wild habitats, putting unvaccinated domestic animals in contact with wildlife, and even catching bats for food, folk medicine, and novelty. Yes, Americans import bats illegally from around the world to display and trade as collector's items.The solution to preventing these diseases and ones we have yet to discover is to reduce our impact on wild places and protect bats from disturbance, hunting and misguided persecution. As Bat Conservation International Executive Director Andrew Walker says, \"Humans put their own health and well being at risk when contributing to the destruction of bats and their habitats.\" Indeed, we still have much to learn from bats -- such as how their immune systems fight off disease from the same agents that kill people and other animals. Demonizing bats and eradicating them is not a viable, cost effective, or ecologically sound approach for our own future.Actually, the Chinese had it right hundreds of years ago, bats do indeed portend health and prosperity. Every night, insect eating bats consume billions of bugs that damage our food crops and fruit trees, and spread diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue fever, yellow fever and malaria. Fruit bats serve to disperse seeds over wide distances to create forest diversity and balance. Half of the trees that make up some tropical forests are completely dependent on bats for their continued existence. Hundreds of plant species are dependent on nectar feeding bats for pollination of their flowers to generate fruit and seeds that feed people and animals. In fact, this same group of bats pollinates the mezcal plants from which tequila is made. Recent economic studies indicate that if we lose bats in North America alone, we will spend at least 3.4 billion dollars more annually to reduce insect pests and ensure pollination for our food crops.Maybe this Halloween we can begin a new tradition. Mix up a witches' brew, maybe with a little tequila for the adults, and give a toast to bats for their contribution to our well-being. We can tell our children about the value of bats and other creatures of the night, and support efforts to protect and conserve a vast diversity of the animal kingdom that is poorly appreciated and greatly misunderstood. In fact, we have little to fear from bats but they have much to fear from us."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: EIA Says Carbon Emissions Decline", "text": "In 2012, energy-related carbon emissions in the United States declined 3.8 percent even as global carbon dioxide emissions rose 1.4 percent, according the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The recorded 5.29 million metric tons of carbon dioxide amounted to the largest decline since 1994, continuing a downward trend that started in 2007. EIA attributed last year's decrease to several factors, including a mild winter and alterations in energy consumption for transportation. Notably, U.S. power plants reduced their carbon emissions by 10 percent between 2010 and 2012. The overall energy-related emissions decline occurred in tandem with an increase in gross domestic product and energy output (subscription).The downward trend may not last, The Washington Post reports. Energy-related emissions rose 2.6 percent in the first part of 2013, and the EIA expects emissions to keep rising. The U.S. State Department said the nation could reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases 17 percent by 2020, if it enacts proposed rules to curb methane leaks and to cut pollution from power plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps to solidify regulations. This week, it began its 11-city \"listening tour,\" which is intended to solicit ideas from the public on how to best regulate emissions from more than 1,000 power plants currently in operation.Cleanup Delayed for Fukushima as Britain Signs First Nuclear DealJapan delayed plans to clean up towns surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant for up to three years--affecting more than 90,000 people who are unable to return home after a series of meltdowns following an earthquake and tsunami two and half years ago. The original plan indicated cleanup of the most contaminated towns would be completed by March 2014.\"We would have to extend the cleanup process, by one year, two years or three years, we haven't exactly decided yet,\" said Shigeyoshi Sato, an official from the Environment Ministry in charge of the decontamination efforts. One reason for the delay--a lack of space to store the radioactive waste that comes out of the decontamination process.Meanwhile, the United Kingdom signed a roughly $26 billion deal to build new nuclear reactors--the first in 20 years--financed in part by China. The twin reactors are envisioned to advance the government's goal of adding low-carbon energy sources. If built on time, the new reactors would begin operation in 2023 and operate for 35 years.Studies Look at Climate Change Effects in Next CenturySeveral studies, looking at everything from ocean health to energy use, have found their way into recent media headlines.New Climate by 2050: Research published in the journal Nature suggests that, on average, locations worldwide will leave behind the climates that have existed from the middle of the 19th century through the beginning of the 21st century as soon as 2047, depending on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the next few decades. The new, more extreme temperatures would first occur in the tropics, where plants, people and wildlife are least equipped to adapt. About 1 billion people, according to the study, currently live in areas where the climate would exceed historical bounds of variability by 2050. The work highlights the need to scale back greenhouse gas emissions because a warming climate may drive some species to extinction, threaten food supplies and spread disease.Climate Change to Impact Ocean Health: Every inch of the world's oceans are predicted to undergo chemical changes associated with global climate change by 2100, according to research published in the journal PLOS Biology. More than two dozen scientists used projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, along with biological and socioeconomic data, to predict how oceans could be altered by the end of the century.\"If global CO2 emissions are not reduced, substantial degradation of marine ecosystems and associated human hardships are very likely to occur,\" the study said.This follows research published in Nature showing that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, coral reefs could be extinct by 2050.Carbon Capture and Storage Development Slows: A new study suggests that since 2012, the number of projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants dropped from 75 to 65 worldwide. Although the number U.S. is a global leader in developing and deploying carbon capture and storage and carbon capture utilization and storage technology, it has proposed no new projects in these areas--in fact, no new projects have been proposed outside of China.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department seeking documents that would show how Environmental Resources Management was chosen. Sierra Club provided some of the documents it received to The Huffington Post.But the documents do not indicate that the State Department conducted its own investigation into the company's ties to pipeline operator TransCanada before approving it to produce the analysis. Environmental Resources Management's draft supplemental environmental analysis, released in March, recommended changes to the pipeline route, but declared the project would have \"no significant impacts to most resources.\" The Obama administration's decision on the pipeline is expected sometime early next year.Included in the documents Sierra Club obtained is a memo from a State Department staffer to Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, that recommends Environmental Resources Management for the pipeline contract.\"ERM is the only candidate that has not worked for TransCanada or its subsidiaries of affiliates, nor has ERM been a third-party contractor on any reviews of TransCanada projects,\" the memo says. The documents include signed forms from ERM and TransCanada affirming that they had not previously worked together, as well as talking points for government staff to use answering press questions about potential conflicts of interest.\"The most alarming thing is the documents that aren't there,\" said Doug Hayes, a staff attorney at Sierra Club. \"So far they've sent us a bunch of documents, and none of them demonstrate that State Department did any independent inquiry into ERM's conflict of interest.\"If State Department officials had looked, they may have found reasons to reject ERM, Hayes said. After ERM's analysis was released, Mother Jones revealed that a key ERM staffer on the project had previously done work for TransCanada, and that two other contractors had done work for ANR Pipeline, a TransCanada subsidiary. Still other ERM employees had worked for companies that would benefit from the pipeline.The biographies of those ERM staffers had been removed from materials the State Department released with the draft environmental impact statement. Mother Jones reported on the potential conflicts earlier this year after obtaining the version of the biographies before they were redacted by the State Department. Environmental groups seized on those connections, arguing that they should have prevented ERM from getting the contract. They also argued that ERM had not been transparent about this previous work for TransCanada in its disclosure form.The State Department's Office of Inspector General is now looking into those allegations. The inspector general's report, delayed by the government shutdown, will not be ready until late-February 2014, spokesman Douglas Welty told The Huffington Post.The department's first environmental analysis for the pipeline was conducted by Cardo Entrix, a company whose previous work for TransCanada prompted environmental groups to complain of conflicts of interest. That led to an investigation by the State Department's inspector general, which found no evidence that TransCanada had \"improperly influenced\" State's selection of the contractor and no actual conflict of interest in hiring Cardno Entrix. But the report dinged the department for failing to independently evaluate the contractor's claim that it had no conflicts and for \"accepting them at face value.\"Sierra Club's FOIA request sought records related to State's approval of ERM for the second study to see what, if anything, the department did differently in evaluating potential conflicts of interest for the new environmental study. \"It looks like State Department did exactly what they did last time, which is take ERM and TransCanada's statements at face value and not do any independent evaluation,\" Hayes said.In response to questions about the documents, a State Department official said the department doesn't believe there was a conflict of interest in selecting ERM.\"No Environmental Resources Management (ERM) employees working on the review have worked for TransCanada,\" said the official. \"Our rigorous conflict of interest procedures are designed to ensure that no contractors or subcontractors have financial or other interests in the outcome of a project.\"The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior both have submitted comments critical of ERM's study. The EPA said the study included \"insufficient information\" about several environmental concerns.Another document released in response to the FOIA request is a State Department press guidance from of Aug. 3, 2012. It includes this paragraph as a suggested response to reporters' questions about whether ERM had worked with TransCanada before:No, ERM has neither worked directly for TransCanada before, nor has it worked as a third-party contractor for a federal agency reviewing a TransCanada project. This is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.The FOIA includes another version of the press guidance dated three days later. That document removes the line that says this \"is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.\"Ross Hammond, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the removal of that line raises more questions about any potential relationships between ERM and TransCanada, and what the State Department knew about them. Hammond said the information that has come out about ties between the contractors and TransCanada should also raises questions about the Keystone report that ERM wrote.\"There's no reason that anyone should have any confidence -- particularly the president, who will be making the decision on this pipeline -- that what they put in this report is true,\" said Hammond."}, {"title": "U.S. Wildfire Smoke Poses Health Threats To Distant States", "text": "By Laura ZuckermanOct 24 (Reuters) - Massive clouds of smoke spewed from U.S. wildfires raging ever more intensely in recent summers send soot, carbon monoxide and other toxins far and wide, posing health hazards for distant communities, scientists warned in a study on Thursday.The Natural Resources Defense Council report was based on government satellite images of smoke plumes from 2011, the latest such data available, providing a national snapshot of wildfire-related air pollution that year.Wildfires burning through drought-parched forests and grasslands in 2011, mainly in the western half of the country, belched smoke into 32 states, diminishing air quality for nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population, the report found.Eight of those states, including Illinois and Ohio, experienced smoky air measured at \"medium- to high-density\" levels for at least a week despite an absence of any wildfires within their borders, the study said.A number of Midwestern states endured 12 days or more of smoky air deemed to be in the unhealthy range that year, the report said.\"Even if you don't live near wildfires, your health may be threatened by smoke,\" Kim Knowlton, NRDC scientist and assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, said during a telephone press conference Thursday.The 2011 wildfire season was particularly destructive, with more than 74,000 blazes collectively charring nearly 9 million acres nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.Wildfire smoke contains hundreds of toxins as well as tiny particles that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause damage, said Patrick Kinney, professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.Numerous scientific studies show exposure to heavy smoke levels can worsen respiratory conditions such as asthma and increase the rate of premature death due to heart and lung problems, he said.The study did not seek to quantify how many people may have suffered health problems from hazardous air quality linked to wildfires in 2011.With prolonged drought and rising temperatures tied to climate change predicted to intensify wildfires in the coming years, particularly in the western United States, government health officials are scrambling to address the spread of smoky air as an issue of growing concern, Kinney said.Heightened worries about pollution from wildfires come at the end of a 2013 wildfire season during which the Rim Fire in and around Yosemite National Park - one of the biggest California blazes on record - sent dense smoke south to the San Joaquin Valley and east to Nevada, triggering unhealthy air alerts in those areas.

Many of us, as young girls, read about Sylvia Earle's aquatic adventures -- we dreamt of exploring the oceans just like the oceanographer affectionately known as Her Deepness. Sylvia's vision continues to inspire us all. In partnership with Mission Blue, Her Deepness aims to renew the health of our imperiled oceans by giving key spots relief from human stressors. It will take innovative thinking and strong collaboration, along with a global network of supporters, to realize this dream.  Like our myriad communities around the world, these Hope Spots are diverse -- they include transient and mysterious places like the Sargasso Sea, some of the deepest stretches of ocean along the Gakkel Ridge, the vibrant Coral Triangle, and remote and icy polar seas. They also manifest the unique challenges that face our global ocean communities, including how we maximize protection in a changing climate and how to address competing ocean uses.   While it is critical for us to focus on protecting ocean ecosystems with high diversities of marine life and unique sensitive species, we cannot underscore enough the many benefits that marine protected areas provide to people! Marine protected areas serve as underwater parks that provide places to educate, recreate, watch wildlife, and enhance tourism and local economies.  This is why efforts like California's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, which strategically engaged communities in marine protected area design and planning, are so critically important. Another ardent fan of Sylvia Earle, my friend and colleague Sarah Sikich (the Science & Policy Director of Coastal Resources at Heal the Bay) did not imagine as a young girl that we'd actually have underwater parks in some of the most urban places in the world, like her home metropolis of Los Angeles. But as an adult, Sarah has spent several years at the table working together with local fishermen, educators, recreational enthusiasts, and other stakeholders in the golden state to design these underwater parks for the southern region -- just as I did for the north central coast of California a few years before that. A broad and diverse group of citizens & experts coming together to inform decisions about which special places off the coast of L.A. would be protected resulted in a system of marine protected areas designed to improve the health & viability of marine life roaming the waters, while providing ways for Angelenos (and everyone visiting L.A.) opportunities to connect with nature, like witnessing a gray whale from a bluff-top overlook, or being mesmerized by sunbeams dancing through the kelp forest while on a dive. Marine protected areas show us, in more ways than one, that the ocean is good for the soul.  Equally as important, marine protected areas along coasts with large urban centers provide opportunities for people to see conservation in action, helping to build a constituency for the ocean and enhancing stewardship. Some of these areas may not be the most pristine, but their potential to help revitalize ocean ecosystems is strong. And their ability to foster human connections with nature as urban underwater parks should not be underestimated. Just last month, Sarah trained a team of students to help with monitoring local marine protected areas for an MPA Watch program. Many of those students previously had no idea that we have underwater parks in Los Angeles. But now they do!  Stewardship building through education and community engagement will help inform more resilient marine protected area governance in the future, as today's youth will be tomorrow's leaders. And just as healthy marine ecosystems rely on diversity, so does a healthy ocean constituency. We've seen degraded areas of the sea be restored to thriving reefs, like Cabo Pulmo in Baja California, Mexico. I'm optimistic that shining a light on these \"Hope Spots\" while furthering protection of our urban coasts will catalyze creative ways to revitalize our ocean now and for future generations. And I'm proud that a legacy of fearless female leadership for our oceans, (which Sylvia started) continues to blossom through the dedicated work of Sarah and so many other young people who dare to make their dreams a reality for common good."}, {"title": "California, Oregon And Washington To Sign Climate Pact With British Columbia", "text": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - California governor Jerry Brown said on Thursday he plans to sign an agreement to formally align the state's climate and clean energy policies with those of Oregon, Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia.Brown will host the governors of the northwestern states and British Columbia's environment minister in San Francisco on Monday to announce the partnership and details of an agreement aligning their climate strategies.The move would \"strengthen the region's global leadership on combating climate change and promoting clean energy solutions,\" said Sam Oliphant, press secretary for British Columbia Premier Christy Clark, who will attend the meeting via teleconference.The four jurisdictions together represent the world's fifth largest economy, he said.\"The agreement will be based on the recognition that the West Coast is bounded together by a common geography, shared infrastructure and a regional economy with a combined GDP of $2.8 trillion,\" according to a joint media advisory.The four are members of the Pacific Coast Collaborative, which was formed in 2008 as a forum to share ideas on climate policies. Alaska is also part of the group.Monday's announcement will formally link their different programs and policies.California has taken an aggressive approach to cutting carbon emissions from its economy, in part through the implementation of a carbon cap-and-trade system, which it plans to link next year with a similar effort in the Canadian province of Quebec.It is unclear whether Monday's agreement will address expanding the reach of the program to other states or territories, which is a stated goal of California officials. A source close to the negotiations said the pact would include a \"carbon pricing component,\" but would not elaborate.In the past, Oregon and Washington have expressed interest in participating in a regional carbon market with California. They were members of the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), an organization designed to facilitate market linkage.But legislation to launch a carbon market failed in each state's legislatures, where lawmakers feared it could harm their economies. Both states have since withdrawn from the WCI.Washington Governor Jay Inslee earlier this month said he supports a state-wide cap-and-trade system to meet its goal to reduce emissions to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035.British Columbia has levied a C$30 per tonne carbon tax for the past five years, designed to help it meet its goal of reducing emissions 33 percent below 2007 levels by 2020.Although British Columbia remains a member of the WCI, officials there have made no indications that they will move to implement a cap-and-trade system.

However, we are getting to that time of year when life and death commingle and the real purpose of the farm reasserts itself. We are loading up the first batch of this year's slaughter pigs tomorrow afternoon. The ultimate purpose of the farm, though not the whole point, is to raise animals to be slaughtered and butchered so that we can eat their meat. While the killing part is the most troubling, it is also the most satisfying. I feel the best about the farm, not when I am on the farm watching the pigs spin and twirl and bark and run in excitement, or sitting still listening to the sheep munch grass in a new paddock, but in the truck on the drive home from the slaughterhouse, after dropping off live, vital animals to become meat.However, it has been long enough since I've trailered any animals to slaughter that I am back to that apprehensive place of my first years of farming where I feel the nag nagging at me from within the deep corridors of my mind/brain/soul/whatever. I recently re-read David Foster Wallace's 2004 Gourmet magazine article \"Consider the Lobster\" in which his assignment to report on the Maine Lobster Fest turned into a discourse on the ethics of eating lobster. Wallace starts with the premise: \"Is it all right to boil a sentient creature alive just for our gustatory pleasure?\" He delves into the neuroanatomy of the lobster and concludes that the creature demonstrates pain-behavior in its frantic scrabbling to avoid being cooked. Wallace ends up admitting that his interest in clinging to his belief that animals are less morally important than humans is selfish rather than part of any truly defensible personal ethical system. I had long since forgotten how one could feel Wallace's own anxiety coming through in almost every paragraph. I identify with that anxiety very much.\"Am I doing the right thing?\"\"Is it okay for me to raise animals with care only to have them killed so that we can eat their meat?\"\"Should I quit -- quit farming, quit eating meat?\"\"Is there something inherently wrong about it, so wrong that I will find myself thrown into some karmic hell?\"\"Wilbur, is that you?\"In spite of these questions, in spite of the nag nagging, I will load the pigs up and drop them off to be killed. With these questions unresolved, with them lingering, hanging over me, really, like a cloud, I go about the work of a livestock farm, raising animals for slaughter. Because of my unease, I live a life of contradiction, but, rather than become immobilized by unresolved contradiction, I accept things as they are: I am a livestock farmer, and my unease, my uncertainty, my apprehension, do not change that brute fact, that brute fact that I feel so deeply I feel it in my bones, I feel it tingle my skin, the same way, I suspect, a deeply religious person feels his god coursing through him. I kill -- ethical vegetarians/vegans would say \"murder\" -- for a living, but, that is not all that I do; I also provide an alternative to the jungle of factory farms: I provide freedom and care, I provide the barely restrained expression of the animals' interests -- sustenance, water, shelter, foraging, rooting, wallowing, and, perhaps the most important, play and carefree lounging.On the farm the animals and their care are about an idea, or a number of ideas, really. They are about the idea of ethical care, about the idea of sound ecological management, about Booker T. Washington's idea of living a \"high, simple, and useful life,\" about the idea of community, and about the idea of finding a viable, satisfying alternative to my life in a cubicle.The slaughterhouse, however, is the place where ideas go to become reality, and that reality is more or less brutal depending on whether it's an industrial or small-scale slaughterhouse. The capacity of a large-scale industrial slaughterhouse is about 400 cows per hour. They whiz by overhead, hanging from a long, snaking line of transportation rails. In contrast, the capacity of the small slaughterhouse that I use is about eight cows per day, or a single cow per hour. At the industrial rate, occasional missteps in the process happen, so that, for example, a cow which should have been rendered unconscious before having its throat slit, is not. But the line doesn't stop for such a misstep, if it is even noticed, so the animal is fully conscious as the cut is made, and it starts to bleed out. It has been reported that it can take as long as 30 seconds for a large animal such as a cow to die from bleeding out, so it dies, fully conscious, upside down, bearing the full weight of its 1,500 pounds by a single leg shackled to an overhead rail.Thousands of lambs are slaughtered each day by dozens of people in an industrial slaughterhouse, each making the same repetitive cut over and over again for their whole shift as the animals fly by, while merely dozens are killed by a few, or even one or two, people in a small slaughterhouse, who carry out the whole range of actions and cuts necessary to take a live animal to a hanging carcass. And, when only one animal is killed every few minutes, any rare missteps in the process are quickly remedied, and the number of animals that are not unconscious for the throat cut is practically zero. Simply put, the animals are run down the line of an industrial slaughterhouse as abstract units of production; there is very little difference there between how the animals are \"processed\" and how a widget is produced.The speed and repetitive nature of the work in industrial slaughterhouses make it one of the most dangerous jobs in the country. Common slaughterhouse injuries include deep cuts, accidental stabbings, and \"cumulative trauma\" injuries that stem from making the same motion, like the same cut, thousands of times per day. Industrial slaughterhouse cumulative trauma injuries happen at a rate thirty three times the national average. There is a psychological toll as well. Workers in industrial slaughterhouses commonly report a strong sense of dehumanization. Thus, it is no surprise that industrial slaughterhouses have one of the highest employee turnover rates of any job in the country (often as high as 200 percent in the first year).In contrast, in the ten years that I have been going to the small slaughterhouse that I use, I have seen the same faces on nearly every visit, of which I have made literally hundreds, and in those ten years, I know of only one or two, perhaps three injuries. People leave work at my slaughterhouse because their internships end, after which they often move on to full-time employment at other small slaughterhouses.While workers in industrial slaughterhouses are factory line workers, the slaughtermen at small slaughterhouses operate at the scale, rhythm, and variety of true craftsmen -- and, increasingly, craftswomen. The slow, measured pace of small slaughterhouses permits the slaughtermen to do their work safely and without dissociating from their sense of themselves as human beings or the animals they are killing. In a small slaughterhouse, the animals are killed and butchered as animals -- as lambs, or cows, or pigs.Though it is arguably better to treat an animal as an animal rather than a widget, in either case we are assuming that an animal does not have the same capacity for feeling as a human. A little more than five years ago, I encountered Peter Singer's concept of speciesism. By speciesism, Singer means that we think it is okay to eat the meat of various animals because we believe they have lower moral standing because they are fundamentally, permanently, and definitely different than we are. Cows, while indeed sentient beings capable of suffering that have some moral standing (we shouldn't abuse them, they should be well cared for, etc.), do not have a high enough moral standing to outweigh our interest (it is not a need) in eating their flesh. The danger of speciesism, Singer argues, is that speciesism is no different than racism or sexism, which were based on the same belief in the lower moral standing of the subject according to what were believed to be at the time identifiable differences. It is speciesism above all else that interrupts me, because it is so clearly the true ground for my meat-eating justification. A pig is not a person. In fundamental and permissive ways, a pig is less than a person. In light of speciesism, with it, in fact, constantly tapping on my shoulder in an effort to get my attention, I make a reverse Pascalian wager and act as if the threat of speciesism will never come to pass. That threat being we will discover one day, just as we did with racism and sexism, that there is no difference there and that animals of different species have equal moral standing to us.Continually spinning the wheel round and round this inescapable (because I am unwilling to give up eating meat) ethical quandary, I make regular trips to the slaughterhouse. With Foster Wallace's essay on my mind, I feel that to continue eating meat, to continue raising animals for the express purpose of having them killed so people, myself included, can eat their meat, I must consider the slaughterhouse, as the slaughterhouse is, so to speak, the meat-eater's ethical moment.There is a lamb on the farm that I call \"My Pretty Girl.\" She is the cutest, most adorable thing I have ever seen. First, she is tiny. At five months old, she still probably only weighs forty pounds. She isn't unhealthy, just small in the same way that some people are big and some are small. Second, she has the whitest, cleanest, most delicately-featured face you can imagine. She has great big doe eyes. Third, while skittish, she is quite bold and curious. She approaches me with her little nose stretched out, crinkling it as she sniffs the air between us. Of the 100 lambs in her group, she will be, because of her size, in the last group to go to the slaughterhouse, and as \"My Pretty Girl,\" she is the perfect lamb with whom (not, note, with which) to consider the slaughterhouse.Probably 99.9 percent of us never see the inside of a slaughterhouse, and this fact, incidentally, is exactly how the jungle is able to thrive inside those windowless buildings. Not all slaughterhouses are jungles however. The one I use is not. To consider the slaughterhouse, I would like to take us through My Pretty Girl's journey through my slaughterhouse.The morning that I take My Pretty Girl to the slaughterhouse will be stressful for her. For the past five months she will have been comfortably living in a familiar location following a familiar routine. When I come to load her group on the trailer, that routine will be shockingly interrupted. Instead of bringing the lambs their feed, I will open the pen and herd My Pretty Girl and her pen-mates first into a holding area, then up a lighted aisle, and finally onto the trailer. The group of lambs will be extremely nervous and will travel in a tightly wound blob, sort of like a school of fish. As they go up the aisle toward the trailer, it will narrow and they will get more nervous. They will feel me walking behind them, urging them on. They might balk and try to turn around, only to find me standing behind them. My Pretty Girl and the rest of them will be wide-eyed and anxious, no matter how calmly I work them. Livestock are critters of routine, which is one of the reasons working with them is possible. When we break that routine, no matter how calmly, it upsets them. At the trailer door, they will definitely balk. Because of the time of year, I need to load the lambs in the dark, and critters do not like moving from a lighted area (the aisle) to a darker area (the trailer with a nonfunctional interior light). As I put pressure on them to urge just one of them to hop on the trailer, their level of anxiety will rise because they feel trapped, penned in, not realizing that they can relieve the physical discomfort of the close space by hopping up onto the trailer. Within a minute or two, one of them will hop on. I would be lying, however, if I didn't tell you that I occasionally need to pick one up and toss it on to the trailer. As soon as the first one goes, they flow on like water.I am one of the lucky ones with a slaughterhouse nearby, so the trip only takes 20 minutes. I have always wanted to put a camera inside the trailer to see what the ride is like, but I have yet to do that. I drive as carefully as I can, but still, I imagine the lambs being jostled about by turns and bumps is unsettling. Maybe My Pretty Girl will lie down, which would make the trip much more comfortable for her.Once at the slaughterhouse, I will back the trailer up to the unloading chute and then walk around to the front of the building to let them know I have arrived. During that time the lambs will be standing in a troubled huddle in the trailer, completely adrift, cut off from their familiar routine. They will be anxious, not terrified or even frightened, just anxious. My Pretty Girl, though small, will likely be on the outer edge of the group because she is bold. She will face the slaughterman when he opens the door of the trailer ready to run for her life. But, instead, when the slaughterman steps onto the trailer (I will be outside the trailer on the other side of the chute), My Pretty Girl will get scared and turn with the rest of her group and scurry up to the far end of the trailer away from the slaughterman, who will walk slowly, calmly, and thoughtfully (he is good at his job) up the length of the trailer so that he can get behind the lambs. As soon as he moves halfway past her body, My Pretty Girl will rush to the other end of the trailer, but she and the rest of the group will balk at the edge of the trailer. They won't simply hop down. In just that short 20-minute drive, the trailer will have become the familiar place compared to the concrete-floored chute outside of it. The slaughterman will slowly walk up behind them, saying \"Come on sheep. Come on sheep.\" and making \"woosshh, wissshhhh, wissssh\" sounds. When he gets to the group, My Pretty Girl will dig in her heels and lean back so that she doesn't get pushed out of the trailer, but as the slaughterman gently puts pressure on the lambs by pressing against them with his knees, eventually the pressure will be enough that one lamb, maybe My Pretty Girl, decides to step off the trailer, and once one goes, they all go. After that, they will walk about ten feet to the door leading into the holding pens where, once again, they will balk and the process will be repeated. Once they have all gone inside, the slaughterman will slide the door closed, and then we'll button up my trailer.Inside the holding pen, My Pretty Girl and her pen-mates will continue to be nervous, a bit agitated and unsettled, but they will soon calm down some. In an hour or two depending on how busy the slaughterhouse is, the slaughterman will reappear, making My Pretty Girl and her pen-mates anxious again. He will herd them out of the holding pen into the kill chute, which is a narrow aisle that forces the lambs into single file. Just as before, he will do this calmly, thoughtfully, and deliberately.Within a few minutes of being herded into the kill chute, My Pretty Girl will be led forward onto the kill floor. The slaughterman will quickly and confidently place a captive bolt stun gun against her forehead and pull the trigger. The gun will make a loud popping sound, and My Pretty Girl, the cutest, sweetest, most adorable little lamb you can imagine will drop like a stone. It will have been a stressful morning for her, anyone who denies that is a liar or a fool, but, at the end, she will drop like a stone. In the time it takes her to flutter those pretty long lashes, she will go from conscious to unconscious.Within five seconds of being rendered unconscious by the blow to the brain of the captive bolt, a heavy metal shackle at the end of a chain will be placed around one of My Pretty Girl's hind feet, and using a motorized pulley, the slaughterman will raise her up off the ground with her unconscious head hanging limply down. He will then grab an ear and hold her head back and deftly insert a very sharp knife into My Pretty Girl's throat and sever the major veins, arteries, and windpipe. With the force of her still beating heart, My Pretty Girl's blood will gush out of her neck and splash onto the kill room floor. Within seconds, My Pretty Girl will pass from unconscious to dead.The slaughterman will leave My Pretty Girl's body to dangle for a while to ensure that all of the blood has drained out. Then he will move her over to a sort of metal cradle and lower her onto it. The slaughterman will skin her and cut off her feet. Then he will cut off her head. From the cradle he will move her about ten feet away and then raise her up into the air again by her hind legs, spread by a gambrel hook, with her belly facing him. The slaughterman will then disembowel her, slicing her belly open from her navel to her sternum, being careful not to spill any of the contents of her guts inside of her, which would foul the meat.About 15 minutes after being walked forward onto the kill floor, My Pretty Girl will be a familiar-looking whole lamb carcass ready to be rolled along the rails and placed into the cooler where she will hang for a week before being cut up to my specifications by the butchers in the cutting room, while other lambs or cows or pigs, though almost certainly none as cute, are being killed on the kill floor.I am a speciesist. I believe because only I and none of her sheep family will miss her, and because only I and not she can imagine the future and because only I and not she can wish for something different and only because I have considered the slaughterhouse, that it is okay to kill My Pretty Girl and eat her.One of the interesting things about Foster Wallace's article is that it ends with the issue unresolved. Most of us who admit this ethical quandary into our lives end up living with it perpetually; very few of us become vegetarians and/or vegans, just a few percent. Instead, we become like funeral attendees who periodically have our laughs and giggles and general good times interrupted by the memory of the loss of the loved one we are mourning. For those of us who live consciously with the ethical quandary, every now and then in the midst of mastication, as teeth meet teeth through tender cooked flesh, we are jarred by the realization that the taste and texture, the sensuous pleasure being ground between our teeth was very much a sentient critter with distinct identifiable interests, a personality, a face, and the capacity for a great deal of suffering. As at the funeral, however, the moment passes and the joviality continues.Being a livestock farmer is a hard life, in this case not because of the physical demands, but rather the psychological demands of unresolved contradiction, of living life from within the being/Being contradiction. But, again, by accepting things as they are while being mindful of the struggles and aware of how I interact with them, I am able to keep going, slogging through the mud and the muck, through the blood and hard looks, through the hunks and chunks of meat, of flesh, of life taken to provide sustenance, surely, but pleasure as well. I take pleasure, great, thrilling pleasure, in the flesh of the animals I care for, that I raise up from wee pigs and wee lambs. As long as I am going to eat meat, I want the animals that are killed to be raised on a farm like mine, where the ideas infuse the meat with values every bit as essential and nourishing as those of the flesh itself.\"Is there something wrong with that?\"I think so.

Sometimes, when we talk about sustainable seafood at Shedd, people wonder why we include the Great Lakes. After all, when people think about seafood, images of fishing boats along the Atlantic or Pacific coasts often come to mind. Yet the Great Lakes are home to venerable commercial fisheries and a thriving aquaculture industry, which offer distinctive flavors found nowhere else.Sustainable fish are those that are abundant, well managed, and caught or farmed in environmentally friendly ways. Here in the Great Lakes, we're fortunate to have several fish recognized as \"best choices\" or \"good alternatives\" by Shedd's Right Bite program, including whitefish from Lakes Superior, Huron and Michigan, and yellow perch from fish farms or Lake Erie. These ratings recognize the forward-thinking management partnerships taking place between tribes, wildlife officials, and commercial and recreational fishers. Working together with binational organizations like the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, these groups are committed to ensuring the long-term viability of Great Lakes fisheries by protecting the full lake ecosystems that nurture each species from fry to full-grown adult.Like fisheries management plans, sustainable seafood ratings also change as our knowledge of Great Lakes fishes expands. Right now, the internationally recognized Marine Stewardship Council is reviewing and certifying Lake Erie fishers, and other well-known certifiers (such as Seafood Watch) are undertaking additional Great Lakes assessments in the near future to make sure that Great Lakes seafood lovers have current, consistent information about what's for dinner. In the meantime, if you aren't sure about the status of the fish on your plate, you can download a free sustainable seafood wallet guide from Shedd's Right Bite program.At Shedd, our research may also feed into the region's seafood knowledge: Postdoctoral research associate Solomon David is studying lake whitefish on Lake Michigan to understand why some of their traditional migrations have returned after disappearing for many years. It's possible that what he learns could help us understand the role that well-managed fisheries play in species recovery -- important information as we face the possible impacts of climate change on our coldwater-loving native fishes.So the next time you're at your favorite restaurant or at the grocery store, give Great Lakes fish a try.

Since 2008, that average has increased to around 40 per year, according to data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey.The USGS has termed the swell an \"earthquake swarm,\" and on Tuesday, it ruled out the possibility this sharp increase is a naturally occurring phenomenon.\"We've statistically analyzed the recent earthquake rate changes and found that they do not seem to be due to typical, random fluctuations in natural seismicity rates,\" USGS seismologist Bill Leith said in a statement. \"This is in contrast to what is typically observed when modeling natural earthquake swarms.\"Instead, the USGS suggests \"injection-induced seismicity\" may be playing a role. The term refers to pumping wastewater produced by fracking and other oil and gas projects into storage deep in the ground.The safety of both fracking and the disposal of its resultant waste underground are hotly contested. Many have linked injecting highly pressurized fluids to fault lines that trigger earthquakes, though the exact connection is unknown.A magnitude 5.6 earthquake that hit Prague, Okla., in 2011, is the biggest ever recorded in the state, and at the time, a Columbia University study concluded it is the largest ever earthquake linked to wastewater injection. The incident, which was powerful enough to be felt 800 miles away in Milwaukee, destroyed 14 homes, buckled a federal highway and left two people injured.CLARIFICATION: Wednesday, Oct. 30 -- In an email to The Huffington Post, Leith noted the wastewater injected underground in these instances \"may be produced in large volumes from other oil and gas extraction techniques -- techniques that do not require fracking.\""}, {"title": "Climate Change This Week: A Snip in Time, Microgrid Mania, and More!", "text": "A Snip in Time Saves Nine...

One of these is what causes climate to vary on time scales of a year to a decade or two. Especially relevant in this regard is the apparent slowdown in the rate of warming of the Earth's surface temperature over the last 10-15 years. There are any number of hypotheses that have been proposed to explain this -- the leading one appears to involve extra heat going into the ocean -- but a good deal of research will be needed before we nail that down and are able to reliably predict when such phenomena happen.These two contrasting aspects of our understanding of the climate -- on the one hand the near certainty that human activities are driving rising atmospheric temperatures, and on the other uncertainty on what is driving (or not driving) warming on an interannual-decadal time scale -- are the basis for the discordant notes sounded by three recently published papers. Two use climate models to make precise predictions about how climate change will play out in the 21st century, and a third points out that the very same climate models are unable to simulate global temperatures over the past 15 years let alone temperatures 30 years from now.Prediction 1: The Year the Climate Becomes Out of BoundsThe first of these papers was published in the journal Nature by Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii and co-authors. Mora et al. used \"39 Earth System Models developed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)\" run under two emissions scenarios -- one a business-as-usual scenario with essentially no restraint on carbon emissions and the other with modest carbon policies in place -- to attempt to determine when the climate will exceed all temperatures seen in our recent historical past.\"The bounds of climate variability were quantified as the minimum and maximum values yielded by the Earth System Models with the CMIP5 'historical' experiment, which for all models included the period from 1860 to 2005.\" The climate was deemed to be \"out of historical bounds\" when the mean annual temperature calculated in the model permanently (i.e., year after year) exceeded the historical maximum temperature. In other words, try to recall the hottest year you have ever experienced where you live. Call that \u201cX.\u201d Now imagine a year (call this one \u201cY\u201d) when the mean annual temperature exceeds the year X's temperature and does so for all years thereafter. In the Mora et al. lexicon, Y is the year the climate where you live goes \u201cout of bounds.\u201dMora et al.'s results are sobering as they find that the \"out of bounds\" date is not all that far off. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the authors estimate that the global mean temperature goes \"out of bounds\" by 2047 with an uncertainty range of plus or minus 14 years. (The uncertainty range is determined by the spread in the results from the 39 models used.)Of course some areas of the globe are worse off than others. The authors report that \u201cunprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries.\u201d Much of the tropics begin to exceed historical climate bounds in the 2020s and 2030s, while most Americans (we really are exceptional!) won't begin to experience an \u201cout of bounds\u201d climate until the late 2040s and in parts of the Midwest, not until the late 2060s. By about 2050 some 5 billion will be living in areas that exceed the historical climate bounds.Prediction 2: Seeing the Effect of Climate MitigationClaudia Tebaldi of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and Pierre Friedlingstein of the University of Exeter also used the CMIP5 models to make predictions about climate change in the 21st century in their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences but with a different twist. Instead of asking when the climate will get out of bounds if we do little to forestall warming, these authors start with the premise that global policies are put in place to slow global warming and then ask the question: how long would it take for us to observe the effect of those policies. To answer that question, they ran the CMIP5 models with an aggressive restraint on emissions and compared it to the same two emission scenarios used by Mora et al.: a business-as-usual scenario with essentially no restraint and one with modest carbon policies in place and compared the results to determine at what point the effects of mitigation can be statistically distinguished.These results were also a bit sobering. While it only took about 10 years in their simulation world to discern a difference in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, a discernible difference in global mean surface temperatures does not appear for some 25-30 years, and at regional scales for 35-40 years.This long time gap between policy implementation and observable effects arises because of: 1. The inertia in the climate system due to the so-called warming in the pipeline; and 2. The noisiness of the temperature signal due to interannual and decadal variability.Why do I think this is sobering? Because, as the authors note, the \"[t]imes to detection appear long under a naive expectation [most likely held by much of the public] that climate impact of mitigation action would be discernible immediately.\" This suggests that it may be a challenge to keep carbon mitigation policies in place (assuming they do go in place) for decades with no measurable effect. I can well imagine a public outcry against policies that cost consumers money (even if it's a little) when the benefits remain obscure for decades.The results also suggest that climate policy advocates need to be very careful to not overpromise the benefits of climate policies -- those of us on the other side of 50, will likely never see the climate benefits of these policies even if they are instituted today and so the over-50 set shouldn't be given the impression that they will.CMIP5 Models CritiqueThe two studies discussed above use climate models to suss out how things will play out climate-wise in the coming decades. That begs the question: how good are the models anyway?In a commentary published in the journal Nature Climate Change John Fyfe of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, Environment Canada and co-authors address that issue by examining how well the models perform in replicating the global temperature trend over the past 20 years. Such a test of model performance is especially challenging because this has been, as discussed above, a period when the rise in global temperatures has slowed significantly, some even say there has been a \u201chiatus*\u201d in warming -- for reasons that are not well understood. Because they are not well understood, it is not surprising that the authors find that the CMIP5 models systematically overestimate the rate of warming over this period.I would not, and suggest that you not, interpret this to mean that climate models are completely unreliable or that greenhouse gases such as CO2 may no longer be warming the atmosphere. They certainly are, and will continue to do so.It is also important to keep in mind that this so-called hiatus is not unprecedented; there are several instances in the 20th century when global temperatures remained fairly constant over a period of 10 years or so and then resumed their upward climb. (See here and here.) It's a good bet that this will happen this time as well.But what the Fyfe et al. commentary does suggest is that our ability to simulate climate variability on decadal time scales is not quite ready for prime time. The warming rate in the coming decades may continue to be slower than current models predict -- it could also be faster as the atmosphere catches up from the slow warming of recent years. I don't think we know. And so while the studies of Mora et al. and Tebaldi et al. are really interesting, they should be taken with a grain of salt.While I am willing to bet that further warming is inevitable, I would not bet on the temporal specificity of these studies. Some time this century, maybe well after 2047 and maybe well before 2047, the climate will heat up beyond historical bounds. In other words, we don't know when our goose will be cooked, but we do know that the planetary \"oven\" is fully preheated.____________End Note* While atmospheric temperatures have flattened out over the past 10-20 years, it would not be correct to say that global warming has stopped. Observations show that the oceans continue to heat up, and are likely taking up the heat that otherwise would have gone into the atmosphere.Keep up with TheGreenGrok | Like us on Facebook"}, {"title": "The Real Cost of Shipping", "text": "By Bruce Stutz, OnEarthWhen I first moved to Brooklyn in the early 1970s I lived not far from the waterfront and often walked along the piers to watch the longshoremen drive forklift loads of cargo back and forth, in and out of the dockside warehouses. By then these were trucking warehouses; cargo ships no longer tied up. But the dockworkers' hustle, the forklifts and hand trucks being maneuvered among the maze of stacked crates, were enough to evoke the gritty, labor-intensive, old-time Brooklyn waterfront that I knew from reading Arthur Miller and Budd Schulberg.Those piers and warehouses are gone, replaced by a gentrified waterfront park. What remains of the shipping industry in New York lies across the harbor along the New Jersey waterfront, where, from Brooklyn on a clear day, one can see the port's imposing gauntlet of 30-story-high steel cranes. This is a different kind of port, Rose George points out in her book Ninety Percent of Everything. There's hardly a soul to be seen. The modern port is \"a place where humans are hidden in crane or truck cabs, where everything is clamorous machines.\"Even more disconcerting, at these \"Terminator terminals,\" as she calls them, there's no cargo to be seen: no bundles, sacks, bags, drums, crates, or vehicles, only anonymous containers known as TEUs--\"twenty-foot-equivalent units\"--lifted into the air and then stacked by the thousands into the hulls and onto the decks of ships nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall. This undifferentiated cargo crosses the world's oceans to distant ports where identical cranes transfer these \"intermodal\" containers onto trucks or rail cars in exchange for containers that have just arrived. These containers and the huge ships that can carry 13,000 of them have, over the past 20 years, reduced labor and in-port costs and created a nearly giddying economy of scale. Where it used to take days to load and unload a ship, it now takes hours.\"Before containers,\" writes George, \"transport costs ate up 25 percent of the value of whatever was being shipped. A sweater can now travel three thousand miles for 2.5 cents; it costs one cent to send a can of beer.\"Since 1970 the amount of goods shipped by sea has grown fourfold. Asian-made clothing, cars, sneakers, computers, and cell phones account for much of that increase. Still, \"shipping is so cheap,\" George reports, \"that it makes more financial sense for Scottish cod to be sent ten thousand miles to China to be filleted [and] then sent back to Scottish shops and restaurants than to pay Scottish filleters.\"To the good, George can report that this economy of scale translates into fewer greenhouse gases emitted per ton shipped per mile: 11 grams of CO emissions by ship compared with 40 by rail, about 110 by truck, and 1,193 by air. She cites a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which publishes OnEarth, showing similar savings in emissions of nitrous oxide and particulate matter. \"Sending a container from Shanghai to Le Havre,\" George writes, \"emits fewer greenhouse gases than the truck that takes the container on to Lyon.\"Following a hypothetical shipment of cotton apparel from China's cotton-growing province of Xinjiang to its manufacturing and shipping hub in Shanghai, from Shanghai to Los Angeles, from Los Angeles to Denver, the NRDC study concluded that \"a retailer could send 101 full containers by ship and still emit fewer GHGs than one container sent by plane.\"And yet, as George points out, the size and number of these ships make their \"greenness\" a relative concept: \"Shipping is not benign because there is so much of it. It emits a billion tons of carbon a year and nearly four percent of [all] greenhouse gases . . . more than all aviation and road transport.\"The container ship on which George travels from England to Thailand, courtesy of Maersk, has an 80,000-horsepower engine that each day consumes 260 tons of heavy fuel oil. That oil, known as bunker fuel, is just \"one step up from asphalt,\" as someone tells George. \"Only forest fires produce more black carbon than bunker fuel,\" she says. \"Bunker fuel can have a sulfur content of up to 45,000 parts per million (ppm). Low-sulfur diesel for cars is supposed to contain 10 ppm.\"The near-shore emissions from these ships, one study demonstrated, are responsible for some 60,000 cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deaths annually. \"In Los Angeles,\" George writes, \"half of all smog from sulfur dioxide comes in from ships.\"Large cargo ships (and tanker ships) are also noisy. As George learns, this \"pernicious, widespread, damaging and preventable\" acoustic pollution means that the chances of marine mammals \"finding a mate, food, and probably surviving have all been decimated.\"The shipping industry recognizes that it can mitigate some of its worst environmental depredations by, for instance, switching to auxiliary engines that run on cleaner low-sulfur fuel when near port or by simply going a few knots slower at sea to reduce fuel consumption and emissions and, it's hoped, avoid unhappy contact with marine mammals. George finds, however, that despite United Nations conventions and international maritime organizations, \"in practice, the ocean is the world's wildest place,\" where it's easy \"to slip from the boundaries of law and civilization.\"Boarding a container vessel on its voyage to Asia, George intends to break through this anonymity. But it's an uphill battle. When a crew member asks why she would want to write about a container ship voyage, she tells him it's because \"shipping is so fundamental and crucial and no one knows about it.\"\"But,\" he says, \"it's boring.\"He does have a point. While truckers may produce more greenhouse gases, they do at least get the chance to talk while they drive and hang out at interesting truck stops along the way. Container ship crews of 20 or so work long shifts and have little leisure. Like airplanes that make quick terminal turn-arounds, ships spend little time in the modern mechanized port, so crews rarely get to venture far from the ship. Everyone on this floating warehouse seems to spend his time fighting boredom. George's laconic captain, near retirement, has spent a lifetime at sea but has little to say about the industry other than that it's changed. \"The sea?\" he asks inscrutably. \"It's cold and wet.\"Even George seems at times afflicted with a kind of sensory deprivation. She tells us little of the changing skies, waters, and weather as she travels a route most of us would be eager to follow, along the coast of Europe, into the Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, across the Gulf of Aden, to Oman, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and finally Thailand. It's not for lack of ability: she writes compelling chapter-long digressions on piracy and shipwrecks, the human toll of which challenges the industry's efforts to remain invisible. (Ship ownership can be an international corporate shell game. When, for instance, in 1999 the oil tanker Erika broke up off the coast of Brittany and polluted 250 miles of French coastline, it was impossible to find out who actually owned the ship and whom to charge for the cleanup.)The container ship is a major link in the great intermodalized, globalized, and internationalized supply chain. Yet unless a ship sinks or is captured by pirates, we don't ask, as George does, how it is that all the things we buy find their way to us. In the same way, until a factory fire kills hundreds in Pakistan, or more than 1,000 die in a building collapse in Bangladesh, we don't ask where our clothes, sneakers, cell phones, or computers come from, who makes them, or how they live. Yet, as George reminds us, these things that we don't know or don't want to know are \"fundamental and crucial.\"They will only become more so as rising consumerism worldwide means more of \"everything\" traveling by sea. Shipping is now growing by 2 percent to 6 percent each year, George reports. To accommodate larger vessels the Panama Canal is undergoing a massive expansion. Vying for the new business, ports along the U.S. Gulf and East coasts are spending billions to deepen their channels, enlarge their facilities, and upgrade rail and highway connections. And yet when the canal expansion is complete in 2015, it will already be nearly two generations of container ship behind, able to handle vessels carrying 13,000 containers when, as unlikely as it may seem, the industry is building ships capable of carrying 20,000 or more. Such ships will be able to dock at only a few specialized ports, ever more remote and sequestered, even farther out of sight and out of mind.This story was originally published by OnEarth."}, {"title": "Energy Innovation in the States: From Energy Storage to Offshore Wind", "text": "There are those who say that the U.S. needs to focus more on innovation to create new clean energy technologies, rather than relying entirely on existing technologies like solar PV and land-based wind. They are right.But such criticism, which is usually rightfully directed at declining federal support for clean energy innovation, often overlooks the powerful clean energy innovation that is supported by states. State policy innovations across the country are helping to accelerate development of many new clean energy technologies that are not yet mainstream or fully commercialized.A recent case in point is energy storage technology and California. Last week, California used creative policy mandates to help usher in large-scale energy storage. This is an emerging clean energy sector that uses new types of batteries and other technologies to store electricity during times of high demand, excess generation, or when \"intermittent\" renewable resources like solar and wind are not generating power.The new order from the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) is also a lesson in how state policy innovation should be used to create new technology markets like offshore wind. Its elements could be a template for how any state uses policy to accelerate adoption of emerging clean energy technologies.In the October 17 order, the CPUC said it must act to help jumpstart this \"nascent market\" of energy storage. It acted because of the important renewable goals the state must meet--and storage is critical to fill in for the \"intermittent\" renewable resources on the grid.How the CPUC, spearheaded by CPUC Commissioner Carla Peterman, did it is an object lesson in the power of smart state energy innovation:There are other details in the order. But overall, it shows, once again, that states are leading the way on technology innovation, while the Beltway fails to increase federal spending for clean energy innovation.The CPUC order also suggests how state policy can accelerate the introduction of other emerging clean energy technologies like offshore wind -- through a systematic strategy that includes long-term mandatory targets, interim purchase commitments, integration of new private-sector business models and flexible cost controls.That last point is especially important for offshore wind. Some proponents think that elaborate up-front cost studies are critical to drive state policy, when in fact the opposite is true for emerging technologies. Market development at scale will determine costs and policy support should be flexible to accommodate those evolving costs in the future. Because it is impossible to predict future cost trends for emerging technologies, it is better to avoid stalling policy by waiting for the elusive perfect cost studies to be done.That is a key take-away from the California storage order that should be applied to other emerging clean energy technology policies.While federal action in DC dawdles, the states continue to lead the way on clean energy innovation. They prove once again -- like the proverbial joke about walking and chewing gum -- that states can do deployment and innovation at the same time."}, {"title": "Arctic Temperatures Reach Highest Levels In 44,000 Years, Study Finds", "text": "From LiveScience staff writer Douglas Main:Plenty of studies have shown that the Arctic is warming and that the ice caps are melting, but how does it compare to the past, and how serious is it?New research shows that average summer temperatures in the Canadian Arctic over the last century are the highest in the last 44,000 years, and perhaps the highest in 120,000 years.\"The key piece here is just how unprecedented the warming of Arctic Canada is,\" Gifford Miller, a researcher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said in a joint statement from the school and the publisher of the journal Geophysical Researcher Letters, in which the study by Miller and his colleagues was published online this week. \"This study really says the warming we are seeing is outside any kind of known natural variability, and it has to be due to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"The study is the first to show that current Arctic warmth exceeds peak heat there in the early Holocene, the name for the current geological period, which began about 11,700 years ago. During this \"peak\" Arctic warmth, solar radiation was about 9 percent greater than today, according to the study.Miller and his colleagues gauged Arctic temperatures by looking at gas bubbles trapped in ice cores (cylinders drilled from the ice that show layers of snow laid down over time) taken from the region, which allows scientists to reconstruct past temperature and levels of precipitation. They paired this with radiocarbon dating of clumps of moss taken from a melting ice cap on Canada's Baffin Island. Their analysis shows that these plants have been trapped in the ice for at least 44,000 years, and perhaps as long as 120,000 years. Taken together, that data suggest temperatures in the region haven't been this high since perhaps as long as 120,000 years ago, according to the study.The Arctic has been heating up for about a century, but the most significant warming didn't start until the 1970s, Miller said in the statement. \"And it is really in the past 20 years that the warming signal from that region has been just stunning,\" he added. \"All of Baffin Island is melting, and we expect all of the ice caps to eventually disappear, even if there is no additional warming.\"Email Douglas Main or follow him on Twitter or Google+.

That's a lot of cars -- more than five times the number of cars the nation's best-selling Ford F-Series pickup sold in 2012 -- that will use no oil. The eight states are California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. To put it in perspective, these states combined represent nearly one-quarter of the vehicle market in the United States.Passenger cars and trucks are responsible for nearly half of our nation's oil consumption and one-fifth of our carbon pollution. Even using energy to power plug-in vehicles from today's electricity sources, EVs are already significantly lower in greenhouse gas emissions than conventional vehicles. And as we shift to more renewable sources of power, these emissions savings will grow even more dramatic.The eight states announcing this bold initiative will speed the adoption of electric vehicles through a range of strategies. These states will ensure drivers have convenient access to charging stations and coordinate building codes so that new buildings will be more likely to have charging facilities. Each state will lead the way by setting a goal for procuring electric vehicles in their own government fleet, and together they will develop joint education programs. By coordinating through a joint task force, these states will ensure the success of their Zero Emission Vehicle programs.The momentum behind electric vehicles is growing. Today there are more electric vehicles on the road than ever before, and the number is growing quickly. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles tripled from 2011 to 2012, and in the first half of 2013 alone, sales of electric vehicles doubled compared to that time last year. At Sierra Club, we've seen enthusiasm for electric vehicles grow nationwide. Just last month we co-hosted National Plug-In Day, where more than 35,000 people attended events in 98 cities across the country.This exciting partnership will build on the success of recently adopted fuel efficiency and emissions standards. For years, the Sierra Club, other environmental organizations, consumer and labor groups, and many others worked hard to ensure the adoption of federal vehicle standards that will double the efficiency of new passenger vehicles to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Today's announcement will build upon these landmark standards and ensure that not only will our cars use less gasoline in the future, many of them won't use gas at all."}, {"title": "Humane Treatment of Animals", "text": "Strolling down the grocery aisle, the shopper may not be aware of the many safeguards in place to ensure that the neatly packaged chicken, roasts, pork chops and ground meat are wholesome and safe and that the animals presented for slaughter have been treated humanely. While the motions of slaughter may be unsettling, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) believes that humane treatment is the respect that all animals deserve.Humane handling has increasingly become an important issue to the American public, and rightly so. The discerning public demands that the animals that go into those packages on our shelves are treated humanely before giving their lives to our service. Producers must follow federal laws and regulations for humane treatment. I have witnessed first hand the agency's improved approach to humane handling, and I am proud to be part of this transformation.As FSIS' recently appointed Humane Handling Enforcement Coordinator (HHEC), I am working to ensure a systematic approach to humane handling becomes universal in the establishments we regulate. This new approach improves the plant's ability to handle and slaughter animals humanely by identifying and fixing steps that may cause excitement, discomfort or accidental injury to the animals.Since my appointment in February, I have focused on increasing industry awareness of the systematic approach, a measure initiated by FSIS to help plants comply with humane handling regulations and improve their overall humane treatment of animals in their care. I feel confident in saying that momentum is on an upswing. Since 2008, we have increased the number of slaughter establishments using a systematic approach from 28 to 51 percent.To keep this momentum going, the agency has released a Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to Humane Handling of Livestock. This new guidance will be particularly helpful for small and very small slaughter establishments to address humane handling issues. As more establishments adopt these practices, the treatment of animals will be more consistent across the nation.In addition to this new guidance, the agency has equipped inspectors and veterinarians with practical, situation-based training to improve the enforcement of humane handling requirements at hundreds of slaughter establishments across the country. FSIS also established a team of 15 District Veterinary Medical Specialists (DVMS), who evaluate plant facilities, equipment and employees to ensure animals are treated humanly. These DVMSs report directly to me, and we work as a team to address humane handling issues more consistently nationwide.As a veterinarian, I have always been passionate about the humane treatment of animals. That is why I am a proud member of the FSIS team. FSIS believes that humane treatment of animals for food is legally and ethically necessary, and these animals must be treated with the respect prior to arriving at our dinner tables."}, {"title": "Wildfire On North Shore Oahu Military Barracks Sends Helicopters, Drone Out In Full Force", "text": "Six helicopters and a drone worked tirelessly yesterday in an attempt to extinguish a large wildfire on an army base on the north shore of Oahu.The fire began Tuesday on Schofield Barracks land and as of last night had already burned over 250 acres.

To avoid that future, we have to make stopping carbon pollution a priority.But at the same time, people are also realizing that this is more than an urgent challenge -- it's a fantastic opportunity. We have the chance to do something that's never been done: build a society that is 100 percent powered by clean energy. Instead of being daunted, we should be thrilled.When he laid out his Climate Action Plan last summer, President Obama touched on both the challenge and the opportunity (\"I want America to build that future\"). Then, last month, the EPA unveiled one of the most important elements of that plan: proposed safeguards to reduce carbon pollution from new power plants. The new standards are a huge step toward meeting the challenge, but they also show that we still have a ways to go when it comes to seizing our historic opportunity.The good news is that these safeguards set the first national limits on the amount of carbon pollution that can be emitted by coal-fired power plants, which are our single biggest source of that pollution. Tough standards for carbon pollution will not only address climate disruption but also prevent life-threatening air pollution like toxic mercury, dirty soot, and the smog that triggers asthma attacks, so this is really good news indeed.The not-so-good news is that the standards reveal the current limits of President Obama's vision. Because the standards do nothing to reduce carbon pollution from natural-gas-fired power plants, they stop short of going \"all in\" on clean energy. By giving natural gas a free pass, the president's policies haven't really committed to a clean-energy future.To reach that future, we (and the president) need to do more than move beyond dirty fuels like coal, gas, and oil. We need to move beyond pessimism -- the kind of thinking that limits our ambition and our willingness to fight for big ideas.Once that happens, we'll have reached the true tipping point for clean energy. The change won't be linear: As we get bigger inventories of clean energy, the costs will come down and renewables will go head to head with fossil fuels everywhere -- and they'll win.We're already seeing that begin to happen in places like Southern California, where a new gas plant was shelved because solar came in cheaper, and in Colorado, where the state's largest power provider plans to triple the amount of solar and wind that's coming online because it's cheaper and more reliable than gas or coal.Although these carbon pollution safeguards will be a partial victory, the ground we gain will never be lost. That's the great thing about clean-energy progress. Once we leave fossil fuels behind, we will never go back. No one will tear down wind farms because they're nostalgic for fracking in our watersheds. People won't rip off solar panels because they miss having mercury in their tuna or asthma inhalers for their kids.Not only are the EPA's proposed new carbon pollution safeguards taking us a step closer to the future we want, they also are building momentum for another, even greater step: proposed carbon pollution protections for existing power plants, which are due in the middle of next year.You can help. After a delay because of the federal government shutdown, the EPA has begun holding a series of listening sessions across the country to solicit \"ideas and input from the public and stakeholders about the best Clean Air Act approaches to reducing carbon pollution from existing power plants.\" Find out here if there's a session near you. If there is, speak up! Let the EPA know that the only way to go \"all in\" on a clean-energy future is to put polluting fossil fuels behind us for good."}, {"title": "<em>Rachelle Carson-Begley:</em> Going Green for Halloween", "text": "By Rachelle Carson-BegleyWhen my daughter came to me and asked me if she thought we could incorporate any green ideas into Halloween this year, I was reminded of how the holidays, starting with Halloween, are the perfect time to reuse, reinvent, and recycle. In case you haven't considered it, here are some ideas for going green for Halloween this year:Reuse costumes and decorations. This is a no-brainer. Likely you have an old box of stuff from Halloweens past. What can you dig out and integrate into a new theme? Do you have any spiders, tombstones, or ghost and ghouls packed away in your hall closet or attic? Then reuse them. This year, it's all about fun, so challenge yourself to see if you can create a low- or no-cost Halloween using or reusing the items in your home to decorate and dress up with.Incorporate an autumn or harvest festival twist. Last year, we actually went to a harvest festival instead of going trick-or-treating. We decided to decorate the house in fall fashion--we carved pumpkins, put up a fall wreath made of leaves, branches, and dried flowers from the yard. When you decorate with nature, your items have a shelf life into the fall season. And I always buy a few extra pumpkins and gourds that I don't carve; this way they last longer and can be used as a centerpiece for Thanksgiving.Hand out healthy snacks--or forego snacks altogether. Instead of candy, try baking your own healthy snacks or getting some organic, sugar-free packaged snacks at your local health-food store. Or you can forego food altogether and hand out trinkets that everyone can use--pencils, stickers, or (very affordable) miniature pumpkins. Fun!Make it a point to conserve energy. Save on electricity by trying something other than fairy lights and fog machines to light up the night. This year, my daughter and I are cutting patterns out of brown lunch bags, adding some sand for weight, and burning small votive candles to provide a flicker of light. We'll line our walkway with these paper lanterns to give our trick-or-treaters a light to guide the way. (Hint: Always choose 100% beeswax or soy candles-- paraffin candles are petroleum based and burn less cleanly.) The best part about this craft besides its homespun charm? All components are recyclable.Minimize plastic. In case you haven't heard, plastic products are made from petrochemicals through an energy-intensive process that creates pollution and toxic discharge. Most of our plastic--including Halloween masks, accessories, and decorative pumpkins--is not recycled and more often than not ends up in landfills, where it degrades very slowly. By taking a break from plastic this Halloween, you do the planet a favor. And who can carve or make pie from a plastic pumpkin, anyway?Disclaimer: No one understands more than I do how hard it is to minimize purchasing plastic items during Halloween. So how about barter one with a friend instead? A friend of a friend gave us this solar-paneled plastic pumpkin years ago. The solar panel fuels the LED light inside, creating a fuel-efficient and natural glow. I only made the exception of keeping it because it was a gift, and it keeps burning year after year (remember, I said I wasn't a purist). Which brings me to my next point. . . .Photo courtesy of Rachelle Carson-BegleyIf you must use lights, use LED lights. LED lights are a great option in addition to, or instead of, candles. They last more than 100 times longer than incandescent bulbs and, by most estimates, cost 80 percent less to use. Because they don't generate heat, they are safer than candles, especially if you have youngsters nearby. Last year, I found LED lights in festive Halloween themes, like mini jack-o-lanterns and black cats.Experiment with a new candy bag. If you or your children are going trick-or-treating, it goes without saying that you shouldn't buy a bag to collect candy in. Try one of your reusable cloth grocery bags or an old pillowcase. And don't forget to use shakable flashlights to light the way!Use Halloween as a chance to give back. Use Halloween as a way to help people (and the planet) through activities such as reverse trick-or-treating. Instead of visiting neighbors and asking for candy, try knocking on their doors and giving them a home-baked, healthy treat. You can also pull a wagon with you and ask each neighbor to donate one canned good for your local food bank. More organized, formal efforts include campaigns by the human rights group Global Exchange, which encourages children to hand out samples of Fair Trade-Certified chocolates to raise awareness about poverty, unsustainable farming, and child labor in cocoa-growing regions.Actress, speaker, and author Rachelle Carson-Begley is one of the most recognized names and faces in the environmental world of Hollywood.

Influencing an Estate Vineyard of Napa Valley", "text": "Co-authored by Lee GlennRemember a few stories back, legendary soils scientist, teacher, farming hero, Amigo Bob Cantisano. Bruce and Barbara Neyers of Neyers Vineyard certainly do... they remember seeking him out 15 years ago to dramatically change their approach to growing grapes.Pre-Amigo Bob, the Neyers vineyard was cared for by farmer-to-the-stars, Dave Abreu. Back then, Dave was not a believer in organic solutions. To deal with a rash of thrips, he ordered up \"some orange, syrupy stuff,\" Bruce recollects.\"I found the tractor guy putting on a white suit and helmet as he was preparing to spray. I was trained as a chemist in college and knew this wasn't good, especially since the vineyard surrounds our house and we had three kids.\"When asked about the effects, the tractor guy just said: \"You should probably keep them inside today.\"\"We sent him home,\" Barbara adds with a wry smile.The Neyers knew of Amigo Bob from Ehren Jordan of Turley Wine Cellars. \"Fear of the unknown keeps many a great mind from going outside their comfort zone,\" Barbara notes with certainty. They called Bob for advice:\"Spray a dilution of apple cider vinegar, one hundred to one,\" was the answer they received. Poof... thrips gone, no harm, no foul, to soil or man.\"We became organic farmers that day,\" is Bruce's synopsis.Now deeply embedded in the soil of Napa's' Mayacamas mountain range, roots from Bruce and Barbara Neyers' famed vineyard are still nourished and strengthened by Amigo Bob's continuing influence, testing and advice. They consult with Bob eight times a year. Using a petiole analysis, a kind of blood test based on the fact that the nutrients go back into the stem system during dormancy, Bob can determine the nutrients in the plant... a medical checkup for the vineyard. The test reveals what was drawn from the soil. He uses this to determine the nutrients to be put back into the soil by defining the proper mix of cover crops for the winter.\"The essence of a sustainable system is that you replace what you take out,\" Bruce notes.Reaching for his laptop, he calls up the very first custom cover crop Bob designed for them in 1998, which they planted instead of using herbicides. It also infused nitrogen into the soil, added bio-mass and attracted beneficial insects. The difference was apparent within a year.\"The immediacy still surprises me,\" says Bruce.With Bob's approach, the soil's health is passed into its crops, helping the grapes withstand bacteria, fungus, mildew, pests and extreme weather conditions... pretty much like the benefits of a healthy human immune system. The health of the vines allows them to project a deeper, stronger root system, with more root hairs.: \"More root hairs equals more flavor in the grapes.\"Though he admits that the distinctions in the resulting wines are hard to measure, Bob is clear that \"... the goal is to make better wine.\"\"Plus, organic is the right thing because we live there,\" Barbara adds. \"In every way it's the right thing, it's the right thing for us, for the vineyard, for the earth.\"Even with these benefits, only a small percentage of vineyards are organic. Unlike growing vegetables, there is no additional money in organic certification for wine, the transition is expensive and the certification process cumbersome. Problems in the vineyard, usually a fungus or mildew, must be anticipated ahead of time, requiring extreme involvement and vigilance.Borrowing an old phrase, Bruce sums up the required dedication: \"... the single best thing you can put in a vineyard is the owner's footprints.\"... but dedication and vigilance are not in short supply at the Neyers' Vineyard, in either the growing or the winemaking.One of the Neyers' goals is creating distinct wines by using the things already existing in the grape, including wild yeasts clinging to the waxy bloom on the outside of the skin.\"Instead of killing the natural yeasts and introducing bio-engineered yeasts the way most winemakers do, we welcome them. Various yeasts produce various side products as they expire. This helps create complexity in the wine,\" Bruce explains.Using wild yeast is inherent in the Neyers' organic approach. No toxic agents are applied which might disrupt this function, impacting the natural flavor profile of the grape. The native yeast become partially responsible for fermenting the grapes and influencing flavor, creating a product not homogenized, more specific, more intricate... differentiating the good from the great.The yeast in action is a proud part of the Neyers' process. Touring us through their fermentation room, Bruce demonstrates. Stored in the finest French oak barrels, the young wines are still alive as the yeast play their part in the transition. Lifting the carbon dioxide release stopper, the bung on a barrel, Bruce puts our ear over the hole. We can hear a distinct crackling sound in the barrel, the sound of the yeast at work making wine.\"That's the yeast eating the sugars in the grape,\" he explains. \"They eat the sugars and excrete ethyl alcohol. It's the core of the winemaking process. We love those little SOB's as they do their job.\"Creating balance from complex natural forces is the essence of Amigo Bob's philosophy. Applied to grapes, the Neyers embrace Bob's teachings, striking a natural balance to create their legacy of signature wines, the product, exceptional.Cheers...Photography: Julie Ann Fineman & Lee Glenn"}, {"title": "This Food Day, Feast on FEEST", "text": "Today for the third year in a row, thousands of people from all 50 states, will be celebrating a new national event: Food Day.

In three years, the day has become a showcase of the diversity, creativity, and effectiveness of the movement working to transform what we eat, how we grow it, and who has access to it. To celebrate Food Day, we're excited to debut our new short movie bringing to life just one of the organizations rethinking what's on our plate.Started in Seattle in 2006, FEEST (the best acronym ever, it stands for Food Empowerment Education Sustainability Team) is a youth-driven organization that hosts weekly dinner programs where young people come together to cook and build community. But it's not just dinner. The program uses these meals to stir interest in bigger change, helping young people identify community needs, develop leadership skills for peer-to-peer education, and come up with concrete advocacy and action campaigns with the support of adult mentors. As Meng Yu, FEEST's youth engagement director, says \"Our youth interns develop passion-based projects and do advocacy that directly affects the issues they've identified.\"FEEST Youth Cooking Up CommunityCristina Orbe, the Program Executive Director at FEEST echoes this sentiment when she says: \"I hope youth, people of color and immigrants begin to be viewed as an important and powerful force in the food justice movement.

Like a hike in the countryside, surfing was an unexpected way to reconnect with Mother Nature; the beach a big communal backyard where the neighborhood could go and relish the outdoors.\"The ocean was really an exciting notion to me before I started surfing because it's like the equivalent of the land that we had in Iowa,\" Frederick told The Huffington Post. \"It's sort of this untamed territory and it was really a solace and a great place to go.\"Then one day, a condom floated by.Her interactions with California's infamous pollution began to interfere with the pristine waters she was hoping for.She said local surfers had an unofficial \"leave it cleaner than you found it\" motto, and when paddling by trash they would shove it into their wetsuits. But illness became an occupational hazard of sorts.\"You start to notice the water quality, you start to notice how many ENT [ear, nose and throat] infections not only you get, but other people get,\" she said.So Frederick decided to take action, launching Project Save Our Surf, a non-profit organization dedicated to the clean-up of the world's tainted waters.The organization originally started with 24-hour \"surfathons\" where different celebrities would come out to raise money for other ocean conservation non-profits. Seven years later, the Project has evolved into a grassroots education program for budding young environmentalists.Frederick helped launch a series of summer camp programs, from one-day clinics to full-week adventures, aimed at educating the next generation about the ocean.\"The whole day is really just a great day of empowerment,\" she said of the clinics. \"They could get it from a textbook, but it's so much better if they can get it from the camp itself. It's as simple as people understanding that you can't throw a cigarette butt into the sand and expect it to go away. It's everybody's backyard.\"During the five years the clinics have been running, Frederick said more than 10,000 kids have passed through and the response has been overwhelming.\"There's an inaccessibility to the Earth's resources, to the preserved forests, to the environments and ecosystems,\" she said. \"The kids have to see that. It still blows my mind to this day that kids who live in Anaheim have never seen the ocean.\"I believe in optimism. I don't think the conservation has to be scary and negative.

Over 170 main roads were affected (up from 38 initially), and this within the only major Indian city where daily bike trips -- 2.5 million of them -- outnumbered car trips. It is disheartening to see bicycles banned in a prominent metropolis like Kolkata, India. With this ban the city is pursuing a transportation policy that discounts flexibility and real improvement to the system. Instead this decision narrowly addresses transport issues at the expense of the health, safety, and quality of life of city residents.The authorities intend to increase travel speeds through the city (for autos) as an important step in the modernization of Kolkata. They see this as a means to help the city achieve a robust information technology industry (IT) and attract new businesses. This approach, however, amounts to little more than rearranging the people and goods already on the road. It may work in the short term. However, as more and more trips shift from bikes to autos, all will require additional road space. And if this strategy succeeds in growing Kolkata's economy, that same transportation network will need to carry an increasing load of both people and goods. It won't be long until more road capacity will be required. Cities in the U.S. have been struggling to 'pave their way out of congestion' for decades. It doesn't work.As an economic development strategy, it is hard to argue with placing the emphasis on transportation. International economic centers like New York City and London focus on increased and improved options for transportation. They encourage certain types of congestion, and of course manage automobile use. They most certainly do not, however, confuse the concept of traffic reduction with an increase in the number cars on the road. These are cities known for their public transportation and their recent forays into increased bike use (CitiBike), as well as zones that are designed to discourage individual auto use through taxation. They do not view the bicycle as an antiquated novelty. Rather, they see it as an important piece of the transportation network and as an amenity that attracts creative and industrious talent.It has long been thought that more driving -- and indeed greater driving ease facilitated by abundant roadways -- goes hand-in-hand with economic growth. However, recent trends in the U.S. show that National Gross Domestic Product (GDP) continues to increase as individuals drive less each year. In the last decade, we've seen a 'decoupling' between the extent of driving and the growth of our economy. This trend has been observed in other developed countries as well. The relationship persists at the state level; states with higher car use have less per capita wealth.This seems particularly relevant for the IT industry that Kolkata hopes to attract. According to the rankings of the League of American Bicyclists, the 25 states most supportive of biking have a per capita GDP about 13 percent higher than the other half. When we focus on just the IT-related economy even stronger relationships appear; the average IT economy in the top 25 biking states is more than 200 percent larger than that of the bottom half, and the top 10 biking states have, on average, 2.5 times the IT dollars per person than the other 40 states ($3,516 versus $1,359). It would appear that the more bike-friendly states in the U.S. have done a much better job of attracting skilled workers to the IT industry.Kolkata's recent biking ban is also likely to add to the city's health costs. According to a recent report by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer, air pollution is a major cause of cancer, especially in Kolkata and Delhi. Further, the Indian Centre for Science and the Environment has noted that during the years 2009-2011, lung cancer was the leading form of carcinoma, with many cases occurring in non-smoking individuals. Half of India's urban dwellers live in cities that exceed particulate matter standards; a third live in areas whose air quality is classified as \"critical.\"Active commuting (via biking or walking) provides documented health and economic benefits. In the U.S., cities with the highest rates of biking and walking have rates of obesity and diabetes 20 and 23 percent lower, respectively, than cities with the lowest rates of active commuting. Our own research shows savings of approximately 1,300 lives and $8 billion annually in health and mortality costs in the Upper Midwest region alone. In London, bicycle commuting has been estimated to reduce heart attacks and stroke by almost 20 percent.Given Kolkata's abundance of cyclists, encouraging biking would seem an ideal way to distinguish itself from Indian counterparts. It could simultaneously stake its claim for India's IT growth while making meaningful progress toward modernity. Such a path begins with policies that legitimize and respect forms of transportation that include cycling and walking. As popular and widely used as these modes are, it is hardly a surprise that Kolkata's recent miscalculations have been met with protest.In the face of the IPCC's recently released 5th Assessment Report (AR5), urban policies like Kolkata's ban on cyclists are particularly unfortunate. The AR5 emphasized the increased likelihood of dangerous and widespread atmospheric warming by the end of the century, and Kolkata has chosen to pursue a misguided policy whose negative implications will affect global climate as well as the local health and economy."}, {"title": "Putting Pigs Before Politics", "text": "The federal shutdown may be over for the time being, but Washington's partisan paralysis remains, even on issues where common ground should be easy to reach. For that reason, it can sometimes be a breath of fresh air to look at what's happening in the states where bipartisanship can be a little less difficult to come by. That's especially the case on certain important social issues, perhaps most notably when it comes to preventing animal cruelty.In New Jersey, state lawmakers recently voted overwhelmingly to ban the inhumane confinement of breeding pigs in tiny cages. Most breeding pigs are confined day and night during their four-month pregnancy in gestation crates. These cages are barely larger than the animals' bodies, preventing them from even turning around. They're then placed into another crate to give birth, are re-impregnated, and are put back into a gestation crate. This happens pregnancy after pregnancy for their entire lives, adding up to years of virtual immobilization.Nine states have passed laws to ban gestation crates, and New Jersey lawmakers want their state to become thetenth. That's why they voted in a major bipartisan show of support, 60-5 (Assembly) and 29-4 (Senate) to implement this animal welfare policy in New Jersey. Even more, a statewide survey conducted by Mason-Dixon showed that 91 percent of New Jersey voters support the legislation.Despite the strong support for preventing one of the most egregious forms of animal abuse in our society, Gov. Chris Christie regrettably vetoed the bill after pressure from out-of-state pork industry interests.When polling reveals that more than nine of 10 voters support a measure and it has the support of nearly every member of the state legislature, you know it's a non-partisan, common sense bill.And common sense also tells us that animals shouldn't be locked in cages so small they can barely move an inch their entire lives. Renowned animal welfare scientist, Temple Grandin, Ph.D., makes this fact very clear: \"Confining an animal for most of its life in a box in which it is not able to turn around does not provide a decent life.\" Grandin further states, \"We've got to treat animals right, and the gestation stalls have got to go.\"The corporate sector is listening to their customers and this science, too. Companies like Chipotle have long prohibited pork from gestation crate confinement operations in their supply chains, and 60 other major pork buyers -- including McDonald's, Costco and Burger King -- have announced gestation crate elimination plans for their supply chains. Many traditional farm families have avoided using gestation crates for generations.Undeterred by the setback from the governor, New Jersey's lawmakers are now seeking to override this irresponsible veto. It will require take a 2/3 majority of members in the legislature, which is a smaller margin than the original vote in favor of the people's representatives, to enact the legislation into law. The Humane Society of the United States is spearheading a campaign in the state to aid that effort.To date, nine New Jersey newspapers have editorialized in favor of passing the bill, including The Daily Journal, The Asbury Park Press, Daily Record, The Courier News, Press of Atlantic City, Courier-Post, The Times of Trenton, Home News Tribune, and The Star-Ledger.Time will tell if New Jersey lawmakers will stick with their original bipartisan vote to tackle this important animal welfare issue. If they do, it will show a real triumph of sound public policy rather than allowing petty politics to rule the day.Paul Shapiro is the vice president of farm animal protection at The Humane Society of the United States.

In my career as a reporter, I've been on more than a few drug raids and seen my fair share of marijuana plants. But nothing prepared me for what's growing in northern California. As Mendocino Sheriff Tom Allman describes them, they're \"super-mega-steroid marijuana plants. We followed Sheriff Allman along on a raid near Ukiah where deputies had just discovered more than a hundred plants the size of giant Christmas trees, some reaching 15 feet high. It's the latest trend in pot farms, or what are increasingly looking like pot plantations! So how'd they get so big? Sheriff Allman says it's a combination of genetic modification, fertilizers, pesticides, California's ideal growing climate and water, lots of water.While the super plants we found in an illegal growing operation were in Mendocino County, they're popping up all over the state, and much of the time on public land where illegal large-scale cultivation of marijuana is destroying local ecosystems. And, increasingly, it's not locals who are farming the pot plants. Allman told me that Latin American, even European syndicates, have moved in to the back woods where they are growing far from prying eyes. This is a multi-billion dollar business and those who I spoke to used words like \"crisis\" and \"out of control\" to describe what's going on here. Think about this -- illegal marijuana farms in northern California are actually sucking the mighty Eel River dry, and that's threatening the native salmon population.Big time marijuana operations are the subject of our latest investigation for Dan Rather Reports on AXS TV. While the diversion of water from rivers is a big concern, the use of toxic pesticides -- some banned long ago in the U.S. -- to keep anything and everything away from crops is also troubling. These pesticides are poisoning wildlife and contaminating the water supply. We also discovered that these chemicals show up in marijuana that's not only headed for the black market, but in supplies due to be sold in California's medical dispensaries.When you start looking at all these concerns over the environment and the health of individuals smoking pot, it's hard not to think that whatever we're doing to control this drug is simply not working.Unlike other agriculture, there is no crop insurance for marijuana growers. That means that many farmers will use any means necessary to guarantee a return on their investment -- even when it means spraying harmful chemicals or draining a creek dry that is home to endangered fish. This needs to change.More teenagers today are turning to pot than cigarettes. As societal attitudes towards marijuana have shifted -- 20 states plus the District of Columbia have made medical marijuana legal -- we must move beyond debates on whether or not it should be legal. It is time we start discussing how we can guarantee that marijuana is not destroying the environment or poisoning the people who smoke it.Dan Rather is anchor and managing editor of AXS TV's Dan Rather Reports (Mondays, 8 p.m. ET on AXS TV).

This year's event, which aired on October 22 and 23, was called \"The Cost of Carbon,\" and included a website that allows users to input their location and understand the \"cost\" they're paying for CO2 pollution in the atmosphere.Read some of Gore's answers below:Cheesydude: Do you think Telsa will make it as a car company even with the pressure from local car dealers as well as major car corporations?Gore: Yes! In Musk I trust.Powdah: What is your opinion on China's smog problem?Gore: Unbelievably bad air pollution in China -- particularly in the North of China. Check out Harbin (population 11 million) on Google today: the city is shut DOWN by air pollution; 1000+ ppm (compared to a safe level of 25 ppm). Chinese Communist Party values stability, but public protests, demonstrations and serious unrest are beginning to threaten stability and what they call the \"Mandate of Heaven\". The good news is that their new president is seemingly determined to take action. They have just banned any new coal-burning plants in three heavily polluted areas, and have implemented cap-and-trade in five cities and two provinces -- as pilot for a nationwide cap-and-trade for the whole country by 2015. If they follow through, this will be a HUGE deal for global carbon pollution reduction. And since folks literally ARE \"holding their breath,\" maybe they will follow through. The bad news is that they are still increasing the amount of coal they burn. I'm betting on the Chinese people using the internet -- in SPITE of the censorship there -- to win this struggle.Cvasquez12: What specific things are you doing in life to lower your personal carbon footprint? And what is the biggest one specific thing I as an individual can do to reduce mine?Gore: I use only carbon-free electricity. Have 33 solar panels on my roof, seven deep geothermal wells under my driveway, LED lights and highest-grade energy-saving windows, max insulation, hybrid plug-in car, etc. No fountains, btw. What you can do? Make smart choices for low-carbon options in the marketplace, make sure you divest from carbon-intensive stocks; be a smart and active citiizen! Let politicians know the climate crisis MATTERS to you -- A LOT -- that you will WORK and contribute to candidates who really champion solutions -- and that you will seriously work hard to DEFEAT candidates who ignore climate or take the wrong positions on climate. Help put a price on carbon in the market and put a price on denial in the political system.SealionOfNeutrality: What's your opinion on using nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels in the future?Gore: I have mixed feelings. The present generation of the technology is clunky, fragile and extremely expensive. Price increases are continuing -- even as PV and Wind (not to mention new efficiency technologies for \"demand destruction\") continue to plummet in price. Within seven years, more than 85% of the world's people will live in areas where renewable electricity is equal to or cheaper than electricity from either fossil or nuclear energy! (The market projections for cell phone deployment were also wrong for the same reasons the projections for PV and Wind have been way way wrong: the cost-down curve is steep; the technologies improve as they get cheaper; scaling produces a virtuous circle; purchasing decisions are in the hands of individuals, not utilities; and in developing countries with few existing land-line grids for telephones and central-station electricity, the advantages of leap-frogging are even more attractive. This trend toward \"distributed renewable power\" is unstoppable. But the legacy industries of the past are trying to hold it back by using money and lobbyists and raw political power. Now is the time to push hard to tear down those walls between us and a sustainable future. As for nuclear, it will continue to play a limited role, and IF the ongoing R&D produces cheaper, safer, smaller reactors, they may yet play a more significant role. It will probably be a decade before we know whether or not one or more of these options will work; I hope they will. But in the meantime, we need to push hard for the more rapid scaling and deployment of renewables.Gore also appeared on TakePart Live on Tuesday night, and stressed the urgency of addressing climate change. \"The problem is with us here and now. It's not as if it's easy to fix, it's hard,\" he told hosts Jacob Soboroff and Cara Santa Maria. \"The longer we wait, the harder it will be to solve.\"\"We're going to win. We're going to fix this. But we're in a race and we need to fix it before the problem gets so big that the damage will be more than we can take.\""}, {"title": "New Flu Virus, 'A/bat/Peru/10,' Found In Peruvian Bats", "text": "By Rachael Rettner, LiveScience Senior Writer:A brand new flu virus has been found in Peruvian bats, according to a new study from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The virus, called A/bat/Peru/10, belongs to a family of flu viruses known as influenza A, which mainly infect birds, but can also infect other animals, including people.Influenza A viruses are named for two proteins on the virus' surface, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), such as H1N1. Previously, there were 17 known types of H proteins and 10 known types of N proteins. But the proteins on the surface of A/bat/Peru/10 are so distinct, that the researchers designated it a new virus: H18N11. [10 Deadly Diseases That Hopped Across Species]Tests done by the researchers so far suggest the virus is not an immediate concern for people, said study researcher Ruben Donis, associate director of Policy, Evaluation and Preparedness at the CDC\u2019s Influenza Division. The researchers have not been able to grow the virus in human or primate cells, or by other methods, which is characteristic of viruses that do not infect humans, Donis said. The virus may have very specific requirements for growth, for instance it may only be able to replicate in the intestinal cells of bats, he said.On the other hand, the researchers do not have enough information to say for sure that the new flu virus cannot eventually infect people, Donis said.Last year, the same group of researchers identified a distinct influenza A virus, H17N10, in fruit bats living in Guatemala.So far, flu viruses from bats are not known to infect people. But bats are known reservoirs for other types of pathogens that have found their way to humans, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Bats are also are suspected to be the original source of the virus causing the current outbreak of MERS.Bats also provide a host for flu viruses to undergo genetic changes. The study found a high amount of genetic diversity among flu viruses in bats, indicating that flu viruses have evolved in bats for a very long time.For some flu genes, \"New World bats harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all other mammalian and avian species combined,\" the researchers wrote in the Oct. 10 issue of the journal PLOS Pathogens.The researchers found the new virus after testing samples from 114 bats in Peru. One sample, from a flat-faced fruit bat known as Artibeus planirostris, was found to have H18N11. Blood testing of other bats suggested that they may have been infected with H18N11 in the past. The researchers still do not know how H18N11 attaches to cells to enter them.Follow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Electricity is the most widely available source of power and typically costs about two-thirds less than gasoline on a per-mile basis. By 2025, the average zero-emission vehicle driver will save nearly $6,000 in fueling costs over the life of the car, they said.\"This is not just an agreement, but a serious and profoundly important commitment,\" said California Governor Jerry Brown. \"From coast to coast, we're charging ahead to get millions of the world's cleanest vehicles on our roads.\"The governors of Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont also signed the agreement. (Reporting by Rory Carroll in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"}, {"title": "The World Without US", "text": "In his 2007 bestseller, The World Without Us, journalist Alan Weisman describes a planet that regenerates itself after the disappearance of human beings. Skyscrapers crumble and bridges collapse into rivers, but the primeval forests take over and the buffalo return to roam. It's an optimistic vision of the future -- if you're a buffalo or a dolphin or a cockroach. No more ranchers. No more huge trawling nets or D-Con.But it's not such a great future if you're a human being. In its dispassionate, non-human-centered perspective, Weisman's book is designed to shake humans out of our na\u00efve assumption that we will always be around, regardless of the existential threats that drape our shoulders like the cloak of Nessus. Evolution has, for some reason, made us incapable of facing our own demise. It's almost as if we wouldn't be able to balance our checkbook or plan our vacations unless we treated nuclear weapons and climate change and pandemics as just another set of vaporous bogeymen that scare the bejesus out of us but always disappear at morning's light.Now let's turn from the existential to the geopolitical. What would the world be like without the United States?The recent government shutdown has prompted many to contemplate a world in which the United States hasn't so much disappeared but collapsed in on itself. Focused on domestic issues, Washington would cancel Pax Americana (or Pox Americana, as anti-imperialists like to say) and step down from its role as the world's policeman and the world's financier.Would the world be better off? As in Weisman's hypothetical universe, how one answers this question depends a great deal on who one is. Americans certainly profit from our country's economic and military hegemony: our carbon footprint, our per capita GDP, our mighty dollar, our reliance on English as the world's default language. We take these entitlements for granted. Non-Americans, however, might feel a bit differently. Like the buffalo and the dolphins and the cockroaches in a human-free world, everyone outside the United States might very well applaud the end of American superpowerdom.At the height of the recent political crisis in Washington, an English-language opinion piece from the Chinese news agency Xinhua called \"for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world.\" It repeated many familiar arguments. The United States \"has abused its superpower status and introduced even more chaos into the world by shifting financial risks overseas, instigating regional tensions amid territorial disputes, and fighting unwarranted wars under the cover of outright lies.\" The solution, according to the widely read piece, is to strengthen the UN, create a replacement for the dollar as the global currency, and give more power to emerging economies in international financial institutions. These all seem like sensible suggestions.But as several U.S. commentators have pointed out, this provocative essay doesn't necessarily reflect Chinese government opinion. Beijing remains dependent on U.S. economic power, whether in the form of American consumers or Wall Street liquidity. And, to the extent that the United States fights terrorism, polices the world's sea lanes, and continues to more or less constrain the ambitions of its key allies in the Asia-Pacific, China is also dependent on U.S. military power. Chinese leadership values domestic, regional, and international stability. It wants, in other words, to preserve an environment in which it can pursue its primary objective: domestic economic growth. If it can hitch a free ride on the gas-guzzling, armor-plated American Hummer, China will gladly get on board.But if the Hummer starts to mess with China -- its economic growth, its political stability, its regional interests -- then China will bail. For now, after a congressional deal has averted default and ended the government shutdown, Chinese calls for \"de-Americanization\" have subsided. But political deadlock in Washington is by no means over. And the structural issues that underlie the relative decline of the United States over the last decade remain in place.This is not the first time that the death of the American empire has been foretold. Most memorably, Paul Kennedy diagnosed \"imperial overstretch\" in 1987. Twenty years later, after the palpable foreign policy failures of the George W. Bush era followed by a world economic crash, Fareed Zakaria made the case for the \"rise of the rest\" in his book on the \"post-American world.\" In 2009, the new Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama wrote in the New York Times that \"as a result of the failure of the Iraq war and the financial crisis, the era of U.S.-led globalism is coming to an end and that we are moving toward an era of multipolarity.\" He didn't last long in his position.But Zakaria, Hatoyama, and other observers have generally shared the same ambivalence as China. They see American decline as relative, as gradual, and as something to be mourned in the absence of a viable alternative. The same could be said of the Latin American nations that have long decried U.S. imperialism. The latest salvos in this conflict have concerned the Snowden affair and revelations of the NSA's overseas surveillance. But like China, Latin America is heavily dependent on trade with the United States. If a viable alternative to U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters can be found then Latin America will perhaps become more vigorous proponents of de-Americanization.Some participants in this debate, of course, have no ambivalence at all. The 2008 documentary The World Without US describes the state of anarchy that would result if a future progressive president trimmed the military budget and withdrew troops from around the world. The film relies heavily on British historian Niall Ferguson's rosy descriptions of American hegemony. At one point, Ferguson suggests that U.S. military withdrawal would likely send the world down the same path of destruction that Yugoslavia experienced in the 1990s. The European Union was feckless back then, and continues to be so today. No other guarantor of peace has stepped forward. Only China looms on the horizon, and the film ends with images of nuclear blasts hitting Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, presumably from Chinese missiles launched in the wake of the U.S. military's departure from the region.In Alan Weisman's book, the primeval forest takes over the once-civilized world. In The World Without US, the primeval forces of anarchy take over a world once made stable by U.S. military presence. The United States, in other words, is all that stands between the new world order and the world of all against all.It is, in so many ways, a dangerously silly movie. The United States has supported plenty of dictators in the interests of stability. We have generated considerable instability -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq -- when it has served our interests. Our stability is often unjust; our instability is devastating.Moreover, we have cut back on our military involvement in Latin America and the region has prospered. We've reduced our troop presence in South Korea, including the legendary \"trip wire,\" and no anarchy has been loosed upon the peninsula. We are finally closing down many Cold War-era bases in Europe, and Europe remains calm.Remember, the real message of Weisman's book is that there are still things we can do, as humans, to develop a more cooperative relationship with nature and prevent apocalypse. Similarly, the United States can take positive steps to avoid the global Balkans scenario. It's not a matter of appointing a successor as global guardian or duking it out with China to prevent Beijing from stepping into our shoes. It's not about crawling into our shell and pouting because the world no longer wants to follow our orders.We are in the world, there's no escaping that. Just as humans must reconfigure their relationship with nature, the United States must reconfigure its relationship with the world. In both worst-case scenarios, the only winners will be the cockroaches.Co-published with Foreign Policy In Focus."}, {"title": "Dear 7 Billionth Baby: Some Lessons on Your 2nd Birthday", "text": "Dear Baby 7 Billion,You don't remember, but when you were born two years ago this week, your arrival was a pretty big deal: You were, after all, the 7 billionth person on the planet.You've had a busy couple of years for the environment, especially if you were born in the United States. By your first birthday, you already generated more carbon emissions than a Tanzanian will in her entire lifetime.And it's not just carbon you're generating. If you're like the majority of American babies, you'll go through as many as 6,000 disposable diapers before you get the hang of the potty. American children also get more than 40 percent of the world's toys. That might sound fun (especially if you haven't learned about sharing yet), but toys -- along with diapers -- have a tendency to wind up on beaches and in the ocean, which is harmful to marine animals.Seven billion people mean a lot for the planet.

Today, 20,000 species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction. Who knows what animals will be gone by the time you're a grandparent, or even by the time you're three? Will polar bears still be around when you're a teenager?None of this is your fault. You just got here! But as one of 7 billion, there's a lot of pressure on the Earth. The good news is that you have your whole life ahead of you to help make the planet healthier for humans and other species.You already have access to more information and family planning than your grandma did -- the pill didn't even exist when she was born 60 years ago. It's a little early to think about now, but you'll get to choose the size of your family and grow up to support programs that empower women around the world to make that choice, too.But it'll be more than just how many children you have -- or don't. It's how you choose to live your life.For instance, Americans eat more meat than almost anywhere else in the world, even though it's a major source of emissions, water use and habitat loss. One hamburger takes about 1,300 gallons of water to produce and has a carbon footprint equivalent to driving a car for hundreds of miles. So, every burger you skip will have a big impact.You'll make choices throughout your life -- from what you eat to where you live to how many kids you have -- that will help or hurt other species.

Can you imagine? We throw almost half of our food away. Perfectly good food for the most part -- food we have either bought too much of, believe has gone bad, or don't think is pretty enough to eat. And, don't forget those supersize portions, the ones we can't resist and we can't finish.The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that a typical American throws out 40 percent of fresh fish, 23 percent of eggs, and 20 percent of milk. Citrus fruits and cherries top the list as the most wasted fruits, and sweet potatoes, onions, and greens are the vegetables we're most inclined to toss.Need some more mind-boggling stats? Each American wastes $28 to $43 of food or about 20 pounds, per month. The average American family of four generates 36 pounds of wasted food each week. An estimated 50 million Americans don't have enough to eat. One in six Americans go hungry. Twenty-five million people could get fed, if we reduced our waste by 15 percent.Is there a disconnect here or what?To compound the problem, it's not just the food from the farm, table or fridge that we waste. Every time food goes uneaten, huge amounts of land, water, and energy are wasted. Money, labor and finite resources go into the production, processing, packaging and transportation of all that food -- the equivalent of $165 billion that we end up throwing out as food waste every year. The environmental and financial implications are staggering.The icing on the proverbial cake is then our wasted food is taken to the landfill where it decomposes and produces methane -- one of the nastiest greenhouse gases contributing to the climate crisis. Methane is 21 times more harmful than carbon dioxide to the planet. Get this: If food waste was a country, it would be ranked number three in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.Why do we waste so much food and what should we do about it?Maybe you show up at the grocery store hungry, and indulge in a few too many purchases. Or you run out of time to use those extra fruits and veggies in the fridge. Perhaps the sell-by date has passed and you choose to toss expired food because you think you might get sick. Maybe you visited a restaurant, and they served you and your two small children massive portions that they could not possibly finish.These are all things that you can do something about. There are several mobile apps that can help and FoodShift has an online guide with numerous suggestions to lessen food waste, from work to school to home. Natural Resources Defense Council's excellent recently-released report includes the following handy tips on how to cut down on food waste:Shop Wisely. Plan meals, use shopping lists, buy from bulk bins, and avoid impulse buys. Don't succumb to marketing tricks that lead you to buy more food than you need, particularly for perishable items. Though these may be less expensive per ounce, they can be more expensive overall if much of that food is discarded.Buy Funny Fruit. Many fruits and vegetables are thrown out because their size, shape, or color are not \"right\". Buying these perfectly good funny fruit, at the farmer's market or elsewhere, utilizes food that might otherwise go to waste.Learn When Food Goes Bad. \"Sell-by\" and \"use-by\" dates are not federally regulated and do not indicate safety, except on certain baby foods. Rather, they are manufacturer suggestions for peak quality. Most foods can be safely consumed well after their use-by dates.Mine Your Fridge. Websites such as www.lovefoodhatewaste.com can help you get creative with recipes to use up anything that might go bad soon.Use Your Freezer. Frozen foods remain safe indefinitely. Freeze fresh produce and leftovers if you won't have the chance to eat them before they go bad.Request Smaller Portions. Restaurants will often provide half-portions upon request at reduced prices.Eat Leftovers. Ask your restaurant to pack up your extras so you can eat them later. Freeze them if you don't want to eat immediately. Only about half of Americans take leftovers home from restaurants.Compost. Composting food scraps can reduce their climate impact while also recycling their nutrients. Food makes up almost 13 percent of the U.S. waste stream, but a much higher percent of landfill-caused methane.Donate. Non-perishable and unspoiled perishable food can be donated to local food banks, soup kitchens, pantries, and shelters. Local and national programs frequently offer free pick-up and provide reusable containers to donors.But the change begins with you -- your next shop, your next meal, your next order.

And it may be equally obvious we need seeds in order to have food. But how much time do any of us spend thinking about what that really means? The sum equation of these two facts is: seeds = human survival. Most of us are pretty disconnected from the realities of their production, but that doesn't make seeds any less relevant to our existence and our future.For as along as we have had agriculture, people have been saving seeds. This has allowed us to amass an incredible biodiversity of seeds. Over many growing seasons we have developed, shared, and saved the seeds that have grown the tastiest foods, have been the hardiest, and have had cultural, historical, and nutritional significance. As a result, in India alone there are more than 100,000 varieties of rice!But our 12,000-year-old seed-saving heritage has come under attack in recent decades. Currently, six multinational companies own approximately 60 percent of the commercial seed market. Key players include the world's largest biotechnology companies, which are buying up traditional seed companies in an effort to control the industry and give preference to genetically engineered seeds and crops.Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants or animals created through the process of genetic engineering. This experimental technology forces DNA from one species into a different species. The resulting GMOs are unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial, and viral genes that cannot occur in nature or through traditional breeding.Because GMOs are considered novel life forms, biotechnology companies have been able to obtain patents with which they can restrict their use. Farmers who plant these GMO seeds are then contractually bound not to save seed for future plantings, thereby making the farmers beholden to the corporation that owns the seed for their future harvests.The most common GMO trait, comprising about 80 percent of global GMO production, is herbicide tolerance. Herbicide-tolerant seeds grow into plants that can survive direct spraying with toxic pesticides. Coincidentally (or not!), the same companies that make these herbicide-tolerant seeds also make the herbicides to spray on them. It's a fantastic business model for the companies--no wonder they want farmers to only grow GMO seeds!But there's a hitch: GMOs and the accompanying chemical inputs are expensive for farmers, and they pose risks to consumers and to the environment. So, how to take over the seed market in spite of these facts? To the biotech multinationals, the answer was obvious: buy up the seed companies and give farmers fewer choices.Perhaps the most insidious ploy within this model is to take desirable traits developed through traditional breeding and make them available only in combination with a genetically engineered trait. This means if farmers want access to important advances being made in conventional seed breeding, they have to sign restrictive licensing agreements and sign up for the chemical treadmill that accompanies GMOs.How does all of this affect you? The biodiversity of our seed supply is critical in building resilience to a changing climate, protecting our cultural heritage, and ensuring that our agricultural systems are sustainable. As these companies develop more varieties of patentable genetically engineered seeds and purchase more of the world's seed companies, they're creating a global seed monopoly that threatens the future of the planet's seed supply. And remember: seeds = human survival.The good news? We all have the ability to make choices every day that help support a thriving and diverse food system. From the food we purchase and eat to the seeds we plant in our gardens, we can ensure our hard-earned dollars are supporting a future that serves the interests of our global community.The next chance you get, we encourage you to hold a seed in your hands. Seeds are all around us--in our food, on trees, scattered in the air, and covering the ground. Remind yourself of how incredible it is that something so small can be the source of so much life. Simple choices you make each day can help protect the future of this vital and precious resource.Courtney Pineau is the Assistant Director of the Non-GMO Project.

Many of the species are believed to be endemic to the rain forest and found nowhere else.Take a look at photographs of a small sampling of the discoveries below, or click here for a full list.Photos and captions courtesy of the WWF.Cercosaura hypnoides \u2013 Colombia | This beautiful lizard was found from the hatchlings of eggs collected by scientists in the Colombian Amazon. An elusive species, Cercosaura hypnoides, has not been seen in the wild since the original eggs were collected, raising the prospect that it could potentially be endangered.Sobralia imavieirae \u2013 Brazil | Among the new plant species are a large number of new orchid species, including this splendid pink species, Sobralia imavieirae, officially described by scientists from Roraima in the Brazilian Amazon.Tometes camunani \u2013 Brazil | This new species of piranha, Tometes camunani, can span 20 inches wide and weigh up to 9 pounds, and is strictly herbivorous. The freshwater fish inhabits rocky rapids associated with seedlings of plants that grow among the rocks, its main source of food.Allobates amissibilis - Guyana | This amphibian is already believed to be highly endangered. In fact, its Latin name, Allobates amissibilis, meaning \u201cthat may be lost,\u201d alludes to this as the area where it thrives could soon be opened to tourism.Apistogramma cinilabra - PeruCallicebus caquetensis \u2013 Colombia | This new species, Callicebus caquetensis, is one of about 20 species of titi monkey, which all live in the Amazon basin. The babies have an endearing trait, \u201cWhen they feel very content they purr towards each other,\u201d explained scientist Thomas Defler.Chironius challenger \u2013 Guyana and Venezuela | Found in the mountains of Guyana, at elevation of 4,922 ft., this brightly-colored snake species was named Chironius challenger after Arthur C. Doyle's fictional character Professor George Edward Challenger in the novel, The Lost World.Dicrossus warzeli \u2013 Brazil | The species is named after Frank Martin Warzel, a skilled German aquarist who first imported the species from the Rio Tapajos to Germany, as well as observed its behaviour, including reproduction in the field in Brazil and Colombia.Gonatodes timidus - Guyana | This extraordinary-looking species of lizard was discovered in 2011 in the part of the Amazon that extends into Guyana. The surface of the Lizard\u2019s head is black with bluish white to vivid yellow irregular stripes and blotches. Despite this \u2018warpaint\u2019 the name given to the species derives from the Latin word timidus meaning \u201cshy\u201d or \u201cfearful\u201d.Passiflora longifilamentosa \u2013Brazil | A new species of passion flower was discovered in the rain forests of the Brazilian state of Para in 2013. Together with vivid purple petals, the new species displays fantastic and quirky 'noodles' or 'spaghetti' (corona filaments) that burst out of the flower's centre."}, {"title": "New Gallup Poll Shows 58 Percent Of Americans Support Legalizing Marijuana", "text": "According to the results of the latest Gallup poll, a clear majority of voters nationwide \"think the use of marijuana should be made legal.\" The recent datum reveals that 58 percent of those that participated are against perpetuating prohibition, which is an eight percent increase since Gallup asked the same question back in October 2011.This particular pole is the first that Gallup has conducted since the passing of Washington's Initiative 502 and Colorado's Amendment 64. Whether the recent memorandum released by the United States Department of Justice outlining their new drug enforcement guidelines has played a major role in the latest shift in support for the ending of the federal embargo of marijuana is debatable, but it sure couldn't have hurt.\"The dramatically increasing support for making marijuana legal should come as no surprise. Marijuana prohibition has been an abject failure. Most Americans realize it is unjust, wasteful, and counterproductive to invest in the criminalization of adults for using a substance that is far less harmful than alcohol,\" Rob Kampia, Marijuana Policy Project's executive director avowed.In the 1970s, support for the legalization of marijuana more than doubled reaching a then record high of 28 percent. During the 1980s and 1990s legalization support percentages all but leveled off with fluctuations of just a few points before slowly increasing since 2000, reaching a then record high of 50 percent in October 2011.\"It is time for Congress to take this issue head on. It should no longer be considered scary or troublesome to speak out in support of more sensible marijuana policies. We need to put marijuana prohibition behind us, and our leaders need to step up to move things forward,\" Kampia declared.Another noteworthy piece of datum is the 38 percent of the 1,028 registered voters that were polled admitting to having tried marijuana for the first time in 2013.

At 1,275 words, her statement acknowledges how seriously Harvard's administration considered the issue. The statement opens with \"Climate change represents one of the world's most consequential challenges,\" but \"divestment from the fossil fuel industry is (neither) warranted or wise.\"Last Thursday, Seattle's mayor, Michael McGinn, wrote an impassioned protest for The Huffington Post that lays out the arguments against Harvard's stance, but it was surely no surprise to anyone. Harvard has a history of withstanding divestment movements, refusing to join even the anti-Apartheid divestment until 10 years after protests began.But still I expected more. Faust is one of my heroes. As the first female president of Harvard, she operates successfully and in some ways radically in one of the most entrenched old boys clubs in the country. My own alma mater, Harvard Business School, recently revealed a pattern of sexual harassment and discrimination that was as astonishing in its depth. Even more surprising is the fact that it was revealed at all, much less addressed with such fervor by HBS' male Dean Nitin Nohria. Appointed by President Faust, Dean Nohria pledged to \"remake gender relations.\"If anyone could change Harvard's divestment policy, I thought, naively, it would be her.A few weeks before the divestment rejection, I had received another email from Harvard, the transcript of a speech by President Faust announcing a $6.5 billion capital campaign. Even more damning than Harvard's failure to signal its support for an end to fossil fuels was its omission of climate change in its plans for the future.Faust spoke eloquently answering the question, \"What institutional commitments will we make to define who we are and who we will be decades and centuries from now?\" She names Harvard's priorities as genomics, imaging, nanotechnology, big data, computation and \"forging of new connections and crossing traditional boundaries\" required by digital privacy, bioengineering and understanding and alleviating ethnic and sectarian conflict.How could there be absolutely no mention of climate change? Surely this issue is more critical to life as we know it than nanotechnology or digital privacy.Then I remembered a phrase in the Fossil Fuel Divestment email: \"funds in the endowment have been given by generous benefactors.\" Here was the most likely reason for Harvard to reject pleas from 72 percent of its student body and millions of climate change advocates:The fossil fuel industry and its owners give big, and their influence is pervasive.Just one example: David Koch, the climate change denier/coal and oil baron, a graduate of MIT, has given $185 million to his alma mater.Harvard's campaign was kicked off with Bill Gates, suggesting that the computer industry might be its primary target. But Harvard's campaign is too big to risk alienating its largest donors from any sector.It seems Harvard's anti-divestment decision might be simply put, a practical fund-raising strategy.But the school is missing even bigger opportunities. To quote the Harvard Political Review, \"Divestment... would signal that America's universities take the climate-energy challenge seriously.\" And what better institution to lead America's universities than Harvard?Another missed opportunity: Harvard could be raising capital to address the most intransigent, complex and compelling challenge of all, climate change. Bill Gates is more excited about it these days than computing. His big bet, TerraPower, is a nuclear energy innovator.Imagine if Harvard put all of its might behind \"forging of new connections and crossing traditional boundaries\" to solve the climate crisis. It might be the best fund-raising strategy of all. Michael Bloomberg has given his alma mater John's Hopkins a total of $1.1 billion for cross-disciplinary work, part of that specifically on sustainability. Surely there are other environmental advocates out there among the 52 billionaires who are Harvard graduates.Maybe it's time for Harvard to rethink its strategy."}, {"title": "Poorly-Camouflaged Insects Can Set Off A Much Larger Ecological Chain Reaction: Study", "text": "An insect's camouflage can have major impacts on its broader ecological habitat, so much so that a poorly-camouflaged one can negatively impact an entire community of insects and the plants that they all live on.That's according to a recent study published in science journal Current Biology, based on research carried out at the University of Colorado Boulder, which offers some of the most comprehensive evidence yet that natural selection and evolution can drive ecological change.The scientists focused on a flightless stick insect that lives primarily in Southern California -- the Timema cristinae -- which has evolved to birth two different types of camouflage: one that is all green and camouflages well with broad green leaves and one with a white stripe on its back that blends better with needle-like leaves.Lead author of the study Tim Farkas and his colleagues found that when they moved the un-striped stick insects to a shrub better suited for the striped stick insects, it affected the ecological system of the entire shrub.After they were moved, the un-striped stick insects were easier for their predators to spot since they no longer matched their surroundings. As a result, their poor camouflage ended up attracting more scrub-jays and other birds that feast on stick insects and this in turn put the rest of insects living in the shrub in greater jeopardy and the number of living insects as a whole decreased. Some species from the shrub with mismatched insects even disappeared from it completely.\u201cOur study shows that the evolution of poor camouflage in one species can affect all the other species living there and affect the plant as well,\u201d Farkas said. \u201cIt\u2019s intuitive, but also really surprising.\u201dA commonly-cited example is the English Peppered Moth, which used to be light in color with \"peppered\" spots until industrialization in the 1950s blackened the trees with coal smoke and made a similarly darker moth more common. A lighter moth against the backdrop of darkened bark had made them easier for predators to spot.\u201cStudies of how rapid evolution can affect the ecology of populations, communities and ecosystems are difficult to accomplish and therefore rare,\u201d Farkas said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping our research helps biologists to appreciate the extent of dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution, and that it can be used by applied scientists to combat emerging threats to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and food security.\u201d"}, {"title": "If Americans Overwhelmingly Love Our National Parks, Why Isn't Congress Fully Funding Them?", "text": "It's not difficult to understand why Americans show such strong bipartisan support and genuine love for our national parks -- one visit is all it takes.I had one of those special visits ten years ago when I traveled to Alaska with my husband, son, and parents to experience Denali National Park for the first time. It was like nothing we had ever seen, and I still remember the look on my son's face after we spotted a grizzly bear sow in the wild with her cub. No matter how many times you look at pictures of unspoiled landscapes, see animals in zoos, or hear stories about how magical a national park is, there is nothing like coming face to face with nature in its truest state. My son's expression of sheer awe is one that visitors throughout our 401 national parks can relate to. Whether it's the excitement at watching Yellowstone's Old Faithful erupt or the reverence of reading names on the Vietnam Memorial for the first time, national parks move us, and the memories stay with us for a lifetime.During the 16 days Congress closed the federal government, legislators from both sides of the aisle made public displays of how important these places were to them, too. We saw prominent members of both the House and the Senate give heartfelt speeches and make passionate statements to the press proclaiming their dedication to the very park system they had closed just days earlier. Will these lawmakers remember that devotion to national parks when their short-term funding resolution runs out again on January 15?That's right -- national parks and other federal government functions are open again, but only with enough funding to stay afloat through early winter. How can park managers plan ahead with any kind of certainty as they consider everything from building maintenance to snow plowing to special events? We're back to the same kind of stopgap thinking that got us in trouble in the first place. What we need now is a long-term solution.Meanwhile, the shutdown has had a real and lasting impact on our national parks and the people who depend on them. How many of the thousands of private-sector workers that went without pay will be scrambling to pay their bills this month? We keep hearing reports from small business owners that were devastated by the closures, including some who have even gone bankrupt, forcing layoffs in communities that are already hurting. And the parks themselves, which were already understaffed before the shutdown, suffered greatly with almost no one on duty to protect them for weeks. When officials reopened the parks, they began reporting vandalism from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, including broken locks and gates, trampled vegetation, and spray-painted graffiti on signs, buildings, and roads. Is this really what we want for our \"best idea\"?These impacts are heartbreaking, but only the latest symptoms of a much larger problem. Months before Congress closed the federal government, officials at national parks were already cutting back on staff and hanging closed signs on roads, visitor centers, and campgrounds due to the sequester. The latest short-term resolution from Congress only continues these damaging across-the-board spending cuts, and only for another couple of months. Remember how terrible it felt to be shut out of our national parks for just a couple of weeks? How you longed to go on a hike or a canoe ride or a picnic in a favorite spot with your family? If Congress stays on this damaging course of chipping away at the Park Service budget, we will continue to see cutbacks, closures, crumbling infrastructure, and disrepair in these places we love -- the very places that should represent the best we have to offer as a nation.National parks are one of the few issues we all say we agree on -- but now it's time for our lawmakers to do something. The Park Service budget represents just one-fifteenth of one percent of our federal budget, and this relatively small investment helps generate $31 billion for local economies each year. Congress: It's time to put your money where your mouth is, restore critically needed funding to our National Park Service budget, and stop shortchanging our country's most special places.

Among the mindful consumers within our WeHatetoWaste online community, food waste is now on par with long-standing environmental concerns such as water and energy supplies.People care about food waste for all kinds of reasons, starting with moral issues such as global hunger, environmental reasons including carbon footprint (food waste decomposes in landfills into methane, a potent greenhouse gas), and even health concerns like obesity. Despite all the attention traditionally given to leftovers, food scraps, uneaten crusts of bread, our consumers seem to be especially concerned about food waste away from home, and they are willing to take steps to deal with it that have implications for restaurant branding and practices, particularly regarding portion control and choice of doggie bags.Mindful Consumers Weigh In We've been busy polling the many mindful consumers who visit our WeHateToWaste.com community website and we've garnered many insights that suggest that consumers see over-sized portions as a strong contributing factor to food waste (not to mention obesity) and seek options in smaller portion sizes and the economic benefits that go with it. Compounding the issue are the inferiorly designed doggie ('to-go') bags that make taking home uneaten food impractical, less desirable, and even wasteful in and of itself because of bulky, often non-recyclable packaging.What Restaurants Can Do To Prevent Food Waste  Restaurants that can proactively address diners needs have particular opportunities to enhance revenues, profits, and image. For starters, try more flexible portion options (with accompanying pricing) that can broaden appeal to such demographics as seniors, dieters, and women (beyond children who seem to be adequately served now), and reconsider 'all you can eat' programs. Make it easy to share restaurant entrees more easily. Offer to pack uneaten food to-go.Another often overlooked opportunity is to find superior doggie 'to-go' bag designs that can accommodate the dual challenges of serving on-the-go lifestyles (not everyone heads straight home after dining), and such environmental and health concerns such as plastic migration and compostability; not surprisingly, styrofoam heads the 'no-no' list of materials, among our ardent 'waste watchers.'Underscoring the opportunity, our consumers reported that an environmentally preferable option 'would make them feel better about their restaurant choice', even swaying their choice of dining establishment in some instances. Some ardent 'waste watchers' would prefer to bring their own containers, volunteering existing behavior using a variety of rigid as well as flexible containers of materials including metal as well as plastic.To make sure that uneaten food that is packed to go winds up being eaten not tossed, up-to-date doggie bags should accommodate in-home use concerns like microwave-ability and freshness, even including directions for reheating or serving suggestions.Finally, concerns over \"behind the scenes\" food waste that are more difficult for diners to monitor suggests the need for more transparent restaurant practices, especially in municipalities with particularly high rates of food that is landfilled. Our mindful consumers are surprisingly enlightened about optimum solutions to food waste, exhibiting an intuitive understanding of the Food Waste Hierarchy, i.e., making sure that food is first eaten by humans or animals, and then composted, and only landfilled as a last resort. Establishments that can divert uneaten food to local food banks and other causes and can communicate same to patrons have particular opportunities to enhance their brand."}, {"title": "My 5 Minutes at the World Food Prize Honoring a Monsanto Exec -- What I Wish I'd Said", "text": "Go here to view the above image and watch Frances' panel, \"Stakeholder Synergies: Socio-Economic Dimensions of Sustainable Agriculture,\" at approximately 1:33:00 and Straight Talk on GMOs: Fact, Fiction, and Food Security panel at approximately 2:40:00.I spoke in Des Moines, Iowa, last Friday at the World Food Prize, where the day before three biotech scientists and executives, including a Monsanto executive vice-president, received the 2013 honor.Not exactly where you'd expect to see me?I was there because the courageous, sustainable agriculture leader, Dr. Hans Herren -- 1995 World Food Prize Laureate -- invited me to join his panel. I knew that in the five minutes allotted each panelist, I couldn't change minds. But, maybe, I thought, I could create a moment of dissonance for a few.I chose not to focus on the seed, but on the system it powers. Not only do GMOs not help end hunger, I argued, but they reinforce the extreme power imbalances at the root of hunger.Ambassador Kenneth Quinn, president of the World Food Prize Foundation, deflected criticism that the award is honoring the biotech industry, stating that it is instead \"recognizing... basic science.\" He also assured us that the point of the Borlaug Dialogue, which included our panel, was indeed to engage in real dialogue.You can watch my presentation here. Joining me in talking about sustainable agriculture and how to end hunger were four distinguished colleagues: Hans Herren, Yemi Akinbamijo, M. Jahi Chappell, and Jomo Kwame Sundaram.Our presentations strove to be informative and respectful. We then sat down to listen to the next panel: \"Straight Talk on GMOs: Facts, Fiction and Food Security.\" It was anything but. The panel included: Greg Jaffe, Gilbert Arap Bor, Anne Glover, Sir Brian Heap, and Mark Lynas.Their gist: Anyone who raises questions about GMOs is deluded, having fallen for what Anne Glover called \"unfounded propaganda.\" She went so far as to equate the certainty of scientific evidence about climate change with the certainty about GMO safety.In his opening statement Mark Lynas dismissed Dr. Gilles-\u00c9ric Seralini's peer-reviewed study showing worse tumor growth in GMO-fed rats as \"utterly fraudulent.\"Doesn't that qualify as slander?The audience loved it. (More accurately, most did, for a number of audience members later thanked our panel members for our comments.)I sat in the first row steaming, aware that sitting next to me was one of the world's most esteemed scientists, Hans Herren, who is precisely the type of GMO critic that the panel seemed to imply does not exist! Later, privately, I told Ambassador Quinn that the tenor of his \"Straight Talk\" panel, which he publicly called \"extremely valuable,\" was not dialogic but insulting.Leaving Des Moines Saturday, I worked to keep my spirits up. Little did I know that, on Monday, my first morning email would announce the release of a statement -- signed by 85 scientists, academics, and others knowledgeable about GMOs -- from the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER). It stresses:\"As scientists, physicians, academics, and experts from disciplines relevant to the scientific, legal, social and safety assessment aspects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), we strongly reject claims by GM seed developers and some scientists, commentators, and journalists that there is a \"scientific consensus\" on GMO safety and that the debate on this topic is \"over.\"If I had known last week what I know now, I would still have focused my five minutes on power, but I would have also said clearly: It is the extreme power imbalances in our world -- exactly what generates hunger amid plenty -- that enables some to ridicule legitimate scientists with impunity.Given this year's award, please join me in asking the World Food Prize Foundation to make three critical improvements to its process -- with the goal of ensuring that such a violation of the Foundation's own vision of nutritious and sustainable food for all could never happen again.And please share with friends and colleagues our GMO factsheet, based on peer-reviewed studies and other authoritative sources -- fully cited on our website. We use rigor not ridicule to make our case.As I stress in my panel remarks, the root of hunger is not inadequate quantities of food but the inevitable outcome of certain qualities of human relationships: specifically, whether they reflect concentrated power and secrecy or inclusive power and transparency. It is the latter that make human dignity, including the right to food, possible.Photo courtesy of Tim Wise"}, {"title": "Asheville Votes to Move Beyond Coal", "text": "Chicago. Los Angeles. Austin.

Here's video from that rally:And now look at the fantastic results!This move by the city council is the right choice for clean air, clean water, and the local economy. The resolution establishes a partnership between Duke Energy - owner of Asheville's coal plant - and the city to work together in developing a plan to phase out the use of coal in western North Carolina.Duke's coal plant in Asheville is the largest source of climate-disrupting carbon pollution in western North Carolina, which makes no sense for a city like Asheville that is a leader on clean air, clean water, and tackling climate change.An investigation by a local riverkeeper also revealed that the coal ash ponds at the plant were leaking toxic chemicals into the French Broad River and groundwater. Coal ash is the by-product of burning coal for power, and it's full of nasty chemicals such as arsenic and lead.\"Duke's toxic coal ash problem is another reason why Asheville needs this plant phased out,\" said Hartwell Carson, the French Broad Riverkeeper who discovered the coal ash contamination. \"The only way to permanently address toxic coal ash waste is to stop burning coal, and the city's resolution is the first step toward that goal here in Western North Carolina.\"What an inspiring move, and a great model for other cities. This is an opportunity for Duke Energy to do right for its workers at the coal plant and secure a just transition for them for when the coal plant is retired. The Sierra Club and the Asheville Beyond Coal campaign strongly support transitioning in a just manner.I'm thrilled for my friends in Asheville -- all those hundreds of people in the coalition there who helped this happed.

Historically, the Fall Chinook run is the biggest single run of the year far exceeding the Spring and Summer season runs. In addition this Fall, 68,000 fish passed through the dam in a single day. According to Ben Hausmann, senior fish biologist for the Army Corp of Engineers at the Bonneville Dam, that is the highest daily run count since they began counting fish.So why the banner year for Chinook?Hausmann points to a number of factors, including the year the salmon went out as juveniles, and the water flow levels that enabled them to go quickly through the spillways. \"You know this was a perfect storm of good conditions. You couple that with good ocean conditions, and the improvements we've made at the dams and operationally what we're able to do, that's kind of the suite of things that makes for a success story\", says Ben Hausmann.To read the entire post, visit Cooking Up a Story.

It is why the shellfish has been dubbed the \u201cfish of death.\"But ultimately, the fishermen have been so successful in harvesting the small conic opihi that some experts fear for the shellfish.It led them to the question: What can be done to make sure the \"fish of death\" survives?Researchers have developed an android app that will help them track the population of opihi, the popular shellfish delicacy in Hawaii, to measure \u2014 and hopefully help prevent \u2014 over-harvesting. The app uses GPS technology to count the number of opihi and record their species and location.The biologist and developer of the app is Dr. Chris Bird, a researcher and assistant professor in the college of science and engineering at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. He has been surveying the opihi for years and concluded that the methods available weren\u2019t adequate to monitor large amounts of coastline at the same time.Members of the Opihi Partnership, an initiative that was launched by The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, and Bird believe that the number of opihi on the islands have declined dramatically. The partnership includes Hawaiian culturalists, government agencies and scientists who hope to monitor the opihi over time, through the app, to see how they are doing.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to facilitate sustainable harvesting,\u201d Bird said. \u201cWe need to protect the breeding areas where they produce the next generation.\u201dThe app will be used to help measure how easily accessible the shellfish is to humans.Opihi are part of a large category of sea snails called limpets, which are characterized by cone-shaped shells. While limpets can be found all over the world, the species that live in Hawaii can only be found here. They grip on to the rocks in the most violent areas where surf crashes on them. There, they play an active part in the ecosystem, helping to stabilize the growth of algae.The shellfish also has an ancient history. Hawaiians once subsisted partly on them and used them in many ways, including for fertilizer, as jewelry and to scrape taro.Bird, who has done development in the past for palm pilots, decided that technology had gotten to the point where GPS tracking and android technology could be useful for his field of work.\u201cAs we count opihi, we enter the number into the app. The app pinpoints our location with GPS and tracks what we found and where we found it,\u201d said Bird. \u201cThis will be used to help scientists assess how opihi populations vary over time, and measure their genetic diversity.\u201dIn 2008 when Bird was doing this work with less advanced technology, surveying one or two kilometers of coastline took a whole day. With the app, he said, he can survey seven kilometers of coastline in the same amount of time.Bird and his team used the app this summer in parts of the federally protected Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. The monument area is around 140,000 square miles of reefs and atolls, as well as shallow and deep seas (out to 50 miles \u2014 or 80 km \u2014 offshore) in the Pacific Ocean, an area about the size of Germany, and covering all the Hawaiian islands.\u201cWe need to work out the kinks of the app,\u201d said Bird, before it will be shared for free with the public, likely by next summer, so that anyone who wants to help with the opihi tracking project can do so. (No iPhone app is in the works.)Opihi at RiskFor years, Sen. Clayton Hee has spearheaded legislative attempts to regulate and even ban the harvesting of opihi to let them repopulate. His first bill, in 2006, made it to Gov. Linda Lingle\u2019s desk. She promptly vetoed it, arguing there was no evidence that a ban was necessary.Hee strongly disagrees and said that his bill was based on the best science available.The senator said that opihi harvesters from Kauai are now traveling to Niihau to get the shellfish, due to over harvesting at home. \u201cThe people on Niihau, Native Hawaiian speakers, do not have stores where they can buy goods and services, as opposed to every other island. The reef areas are their icebox. The situation is such that the state has been negligent in taking care of its natural resources. Opihi is but one species that has been over harvested, to the point that people are going to other islands like predators and taking opihi. It\u2019s very unfortunate and preventable,\u201d Hee said.The State Department of Land and Natural Resources has the authority to make administrative rules, Hee notes, but it has chosen not to do so. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason the situation with opihi is as it is. It\u2019s not necessary to pass a law,\u201d the senator explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to wait for lawmakers. They can do it themselves.\u201dA measure that Hee co-sponsored in 2012 \u2014 with the support of Bird, Dr. Robert Toonen at the University of Hawaii and the Department of Land and Natural Resources \u2014 would have set bag limits, mandated seasonal closures in certain areas and banned opihi harvesting on Oahu for five years. The goal was to put a new management strategy in place with input from scientists and that was still sensitive to Hawaiian culture and fishermen.But since so many people collect opihi, the main problem is that they don\u2019t have a chance to grow up. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough reproductive pockets that are protected,\u201d Bird said.The bill failed to pass again last year, but Hee has vowed not to give up. \u201cNext year I will re-introduce the opihi bill that was vetoed by Linda Lingle. Hopefully we\u2019ll get this measure passed, with the idea in mind that citizens from bigger islands won't go to smaller islands and take their natural resources.\u201dHawaiian Culture  While it is perfectly legal for fisherman to go to other islands, Hee asserts that it is totally immoral and contrary to Hawaiian culture. \u201cThe Hawaiians taught that you take care of the natural resources and the natural resources will take care of you. That is totally out the door today. It is now based on greed and profit, the philosophy of if I won\u2019t take it, someone else will.\u201dDespite the passion of people like Hee and Dr. Bird, some people dispute the idea that there is over-harvesting problem, and they argue that the app will only worsen the any possible opihi problem. \u201cIf you tell people where the opihi are, they\u2019re gonna go get it. You did the work for them. They\u2019re just gonna go straight to that place,\u201d said Guy Takashiro, who runs a popular fish market in Kalihi.But that doesn't mean that Takashiro is worried for the shellfish. \u201cI can always get as much opihi as I need. I\u2019m rarely short. There\u2019s really not a shortage,\u201d he insisted.Hee counters that if this were true, fisherman on Kauai would not have to go to Niihau for their opihi.In addition, the price of opihi has skyrocketed to a price of around $40 a pound at Honolulu fish markets. Bird and Hee said over-harvesting is the cause.The dangers associated with harvesting the \"fish of death\" is another reason why the senator feels it is important to regulate opihi fishing. When areas, especially on Oahu, are over harvested, people go further and further out to get the opihi, and the waves are too unpredictable.Takashiro agreed that it is dangerous, but said that commercial pickers tend to take more suitable precautions. \u201cOne of my suppliers has people spotting waves while the other people are picking,\u201d he said.Individuals are undoubtedly less likely to be as careful.That can lead, even now, to the \"fish of death\" being the death of them. Or vice versa."}, {"title": "Life on the Edge of Climate Change: An Up Close Look at Being Climate Refugees", "text": "To me, Isle de Jean Charles, located along the most southern tip of Louisiana, a place where the land meets the water and the Gulf is our backyard, is the most beautiful place on earth. I, along with the majority of my Tribe, have come to the realization that it is necessary to protect what little we have and that we cannot live there. Once a secluded Tribal Island Community with 300 plus inhabitants, we now have been reduced to 25 homes and 70 inhabitants.The threat of Tropical Storm Karen loomed large for those who call the Isle home. While our lands escaped unscathed, our people did not. Facing a tropical system has always been a dance, but the pace of rising seas and sinking lands elevates this danger to a whole new level.We are among the country's first climate change refugees. Climate change challenges us daily and continues to wipe out our Tribe's way of life.In the two years I have held my position as Senior Public and Media Relations Liaison for my Tribe, The Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha Choctaw Indians, the most important thing I take away from my experience is that climate change is affecting everyone everywhere. Temperatures are warming, waters are rising and pollution seems to increase with each passing year. Some may be ignoring this reality, but we don't have that luxury. When the water's edge is at your doorstep, sea level rise and extreme rainstorms aren't political, they're personal.Our Island once measured 5 miles long by 12 miles wide. Now, 2 miles by 1 mile is a generous estimate of the land left. The ever-rising sea level coupled with quickly disappearing barrier marshlands has left us on the front line. Where the barrier marshlands once protected us, now our community is one of the few remaining protections for the mainland. In addition we lost 7 inches of soil this past year -- meaning we are sinking quickly. With each passing storm, the reality is that one day we will no longer have land to return to. Our ancestors buried on the Isle will be sitting on the Gulf floor.These days, our disaster prep must be faster than ever. With a steady south wind and the surge coming at you, one has less than 20 minutes to get off the Isle before the lone connecting road is impassable. Protecting our valuables is burdensome, especially for the elderly and disabled. In a house that sits an average of 10 feet off the ground, furniture and appliances must be raised. Personal belongings are packed up. Owners of unraised homes must start over after the storm has passed. Even when a storm never becomes a disaster, like Karen, costs of preparation continue to mount.Last year, we were hit by a minimal Cat. 1, Hurricane Isaac. No one expected the damage to be so widespread. It took me three days to get on the Island after the storm had passed. What I found when I got there left me saddened and angry. The young and old were hit hardest. Children were playing in knee-deep water, water still contaminated by the use of Corexit during the BP Spill, water that fishermen report is causing deformities in our seafood.The emotional burden of not knowing what -- if anything -- one will return to is the worst. Walking into a home filled with mud and quickly growing mold presents a race against the clock, not to mention a health hazard. The rising temperatures associated with climate change only worsen the situation, leaving many to simply walk away.Many ask why members of our Tribe have continued to stay. The answer is simple: Here our lands and homes pass from generation to generation, and our spiritual connection, our traditions and culture are deeply connected to this place. Here we live off the harvest from the waters and make our income from the same. The burden of losing your income and taking on the expense of starting over is crushing. Many who have had to make the hard decision to leave are forced to move in with family who have already relocated off the Isle.Climate change intensifies all the challenges we already face as a non-income producing State Recognized Tribe. For us, this is nothing new really. Gulf Restoration plans do not address funding for Tribe relocation, nor protecting people from the effects of climate change. What we stand to lose is the fabric that has held us together for generations. We know that a bigger storm is coming, and with it what is left of our Tribal land and our home will disappear.The local manifestations of climate change on my tribe's home, Isle de Jean Charles, threaten to wipe out what's left of our shared culture. If this tragedy can happen to us, who will it happen to next? Modern man has created the situation we are in, and it's up to modern man to fix it. Will we?"}, {"title": "Air Inequality: Filtering the Future", "text": "Income inequality is a point of contention in the United States. Air inequality is the latest flashpoint in mainland China. Is the latter condition a harbinger of our environmental future?China's rapid coal-based industrialization has produced periods of dreadful air pollution over its major cities, causing inhabitants to take desperate measures to escape serious respiratory damage. Face masks are frequently the first line of defense, but their dilutive capacity is often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of atmospheric pollutants. The only reliable, albeit temporary salvation is an indoor environment serviced by an air purifier able to remove the worst impurities.Here is where Chinese civil unrest bubbles to the surface. Political leaders and their wealthy constituencies have expensive air purifiers in their homes and offices. Furthermore, when heavy pollution strikes a Chinese urban center, the American Embassy advises all its countrymen in the vicinity to acquire air purifiers and remain mostly indoors.  That is all well and good for Americans, the majority of whom are well paid embassy employees, or affluent businessmen, expatiates, and tourists. But what about the local Chinese?Top of the line airs purifiers run between $2000 and $3000, and basic standard models range from $320 to $480 a piece. Meanwhile, the average annual family income of the 712 million urban Chinese is $2100. Do the math! No wonder the grassroots harbors bitter resentment towards political leaders who enjoy first class indoor air quality while overseeing a sluggish pace in outdoor pollution abatement.Even if the typical Chinese family could afford a purifier, the best projection is that by 2016, some 17 million devices will be produced for sale annually, still well short of need. Moreover, many Chinese would continue to be unable to monetarily afford clean indoor air as temporary respite from lung-searing smog. Their main hope would lie in China meeting its principle challenge of significantly diminishing its air pollution currently linked to a record number of respiratory-related deaths.Meanwhile, an unsettling question arises from China's miasmic plight.Will having to pay to breathe be the ultimate fate that awaits citizens of any nation that allows air pollution to spiral out of control? A word to the wise should be more than sufficient."}, {"title": "Why Growling Is Good", "text": "A woman I sometimes chat with during my morning dog outings asked my opinion about an encounter she recently had. She'd been been walking her four-year-old mixed breed dog around a local park when she crossed paths with a man whose dog was off leash. As the owners walked toward each other on the narrow trail, the foot loose and fancy-free puppy ran up to the adult dog. With the usual lack of canine cluelessness that accompanies early dogdom, the pup leaped at the dog relentlessly in an attempt to initiate play. The woman's dog, while not aggressive, did not want to be bothered. He growled. The puppy didn't back off, and again tried to engage the older dog. The dog growled louder. The man made no attempt to put his dog on leash. The woman, feeling embarrassed that her dog had growled, ended up apologizing to the man and walking her dog away.The adult dog's hackles might not have been up during the encounter, but mine certainly were. The woman's dog had done nothing wrong. She had nothing to apologize for! Growling is a perfectly acceptable canine warning. It's a dog's way of saying, \"Hey, I don't like that,\" \"Don't come any closer!\" or \"Please stop what you're doing.\" Being on leash, the adult dog didn't have the option to leave. He could certainly have snapped at the puppy, or worse. But instead, he gave an appropriate warning. That the puppy didn't buy a vowel, get a clue, and understand what was being spelled out was a problem, so the dog growled louder. Hopefully that puppy will learn to back off when adult dogs warn him away, before his puppy license expires and an adult dog cleans his clock. And hopefully the man will learn to leash his dog when encountering others.Understanding that a growl is a threat is hard-wired in humans, so it's reasonable and even advantageous that we become upset when we hear one. But a growl from a dog is actually a good thing. I'm not suggesting that it's a good thing for a dog to growl at his owner, but growling is a non-aggressive form of communication. Think about it. If someone kept shoving into you on line at the post office, you'd eventually say something like, \"Excuse you!\" But what if you didn't have a way to warn the person that you were getting irritated? Eventually, you'd have to resort to either leaving, or physically getting your point across. Whether a dog is growling at another dog or a person, it's simply a warning. If the dog wanted to attack, he would have. Growling is meant to avert aggression, not cause it. But people misunderstand, and punish dogs for growling. A dog then learns that growling leads to being punished and, unfortunately, once his early warning system has been removed, the dog is likely to begin biting with no warning. As a trainer, I've seen many dogs like that over the years and believe me, they're no fun to rehabilitate.If a dog is growling at you, whether the dog belongs to you or someone else, the best course of action at the moment is to defuse the situation. After all, the dog's arousal level is already elevated. You don't want to shout or worse, get physical, as those things could lead to a bite. Instead, glance down and to the side (this tells the dog you're not a threat while allowing you to keep him in your peripheral vision) and back away slowly. Don't turn your back on the dog if you can help it, as some dogs are more prone to attack from the rear. If the dog in question is your own, address the situation that caused the growling -- for example, food guarding -- at another time when your dog is calm, with the assistance of a professional trainer if necessary. Remember, growling is simply communication. If we take a moment to assess why a dog is growling instead of automatically taking the attitude that he's behaving inappropriately, we will react appropriately ourselves.Nicole Wilde is a canine behavior specialist and author.

If enacted, the plan would reverse three decades of wolf recovery across the American west.More than any other animal, wolves are an iconic symbol of wilderness, and their mere presence indicates a somewhat intact, healthy ecosystem. Wolves occupy a special place in the heart of the American psyche. Yet, there is no other animal that has suffered from such fear, viciousness, and hatred by some ignorant elements of our society.For over a century, wolves were demonized, tortured, poisoned, shot, trapped, and snared, all attempting to exterminate them from the landscape. And indeed, wolves disappeared from most of their former range.After three decades of federal protection, and painstaking efforts by federal biologists, gray wolves are just beginning to reestablish stable populations in some of their former range. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the ESA, and much to the delight of most Americans.But this success is about to be undone by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal to remove ESA protection for gray wolves, unleashing the same ruthless wolf-killing policies that originally drove lower 48 populations to near extinction. The proposal to delist gray wolves is flawed for many reasons -- ethics, ecosystems, science, and economics, to name a few. But more fundamentally, the proposal is based on a lack of basic understanding of these extraordinary, iconic animals.As people tend to fear and hate that which they don't understand, it isn't too surprising (although disappointing) that this irrational hatred and mismanagement of wolves (and their habitat) continues today in much of the American west. Many people, including some wildlife managers, still do not understand wolves.But legendary wolf biologist Dr. Gordon Haber, who studied wolves for 43 years in Alaska, knew wolves. Prior to his death in a 2009 plane crash in Denali National Park while tracking wolves, Haber spent more time with wolves in the wild than any other biologist in history. His remarkable story is chronicled in a new book written by Alaska author Marybeth Holleman and (posthumously) Haber himself.After Haber's death, Holleman sifted through truckloads of his research papers, reports, field notes, stories from friends, and photographs, and compiled the lot into Among Wolves - Gordon Haber's insights into Alaska's most misunderstood animal. The book peels back the layers of misunderstanding of the wolf, revealing a fascinating, complex, socially evolved animal that deserves our admiration and protection, not our fear and hatred.Haber was the old-school type of field biologist that is now virtually a thing of the past. He was tough, determined, methodical, and relentless in his quest to understand the real lives of wolves in the wild. He spent four decades studying Alaska's wolves, with boots-on-the-ground even at 50 below zero in the bitter Alaska winter. Few modern biologists have such authentic experiential authority regarding their research subjects. And this hard-won, close-up and personal understanding of wolves led him to dedicate his life to their protection.Haber's conclusions in Among Wolves expose the current flawed thinking behind the current proposal to delist wolves across the lower 48. Most notably, he concluded that we can't just count the number of wolves in an area and conclude that it's a \"healthy\" or \"sustainable\" population, because the functional unit of wolves is the family. That x number of wolves inhabit y square miles of territory is irrelevant. Haber writes:\"Wolves are perhaps the most social of all nonhuman vertebrates. A 'pack' of wolves is not a snarling aggregation of fighting beasts, each bent on fending only for itself, but a highly organized, well-disciplined group of related individuals or family units, all working together in a remarkably amiable, efficient manner.\"Haber devoted his career to studying these family groups, including the Toklat wolves in Denali. First made famous by Adolph Murie's 1944 The Wolves of Mount McKinley, the Toklat wolves rank with Jane Goodall's chimpanzees in Tanzania as the longest-studied mammal lineages in the world.As described in Among Wolves, wolves go to great lengths to stay with family; and when important members are lost, families can disintegrate and remaining individuals often disperse and die. Haber witnessed this countless times. He also found that wolves are mostly monogamous; cooperatively raise pups; express emotions; play often; and develop elaborate den sites, honeycombed with connecting tunnels, sometimes covering 50 acres. Some ancient wolf den sites in Denali were also used by early humans, raising interesting speculations about the co-evolution of wolves and humans.And Among Wolves dispels some of the age-old myths about indiscriminate killing and waste by wolves. They actually consume virtually all that they kill, and waste little. Much of their winter diet is obtained not by killing live ungulates, but from scavenging winter-killed carcasses.Left unexploited -- that is, not killed -- by humans, wolves develop societies that are intricate, complex and beautifully adapted to their environment. Unexploited family groups develop unique and cooperative pup rearing and hunting techniques, amounting in essence to cultural traditions. These take generations to develop, and can be lost forever if the family disintegrates.But unfortunately today there are few, if any, unexploited wolf family groups left anywhere in the U.S. Even those in our national parks are hunted and trapped when they cross invisible boundaries, leading to the disintegration of family groups. And ignorant wildlife policies of western state governments continue to sanction the indiscriminate wolf killing that symbolized the wild west of the 19th century.Haber found that hunting and trapping tend to take older, experienced wolves which sustain the family group through their knowledge of territory, prey movements, hunting techniques, den sites, and raising pups. These are the reproductive members of the group, and their loss from hunting or trapping can be catastrophic to the family group. If the federal delisting proposal is enacted, many more family groups will be torn apart by such indiscriminate killing.He also witnessed the continued horror of wolves he knew being caught in traps and snares, trying to chew off their own legs in futile attempt to escape, and family members trying to help only to be caught in nearby traps themselves. And near death, them looking passively, directly into the eyes of the trapper who would then shoot and kill them, for a $200 pelt, and another story to tell. Such cruelty brings shame to us all, and deserves our collective condemnation.If we leave wolves and their wild habitats alone, their populations will continue to recover, ecosystems will rebuild, and we will all benefit. As Haber writes: \"Wolves enliven the northern mountains, forests and tundra like no other creature, helping to enrich our own stay on the planet simply by their presence as other highly advanced societies in our midst.\"In the end, Holleman and Haber express the conviction that by careful observation and protection of intact wolf family groups across wild landscapes, we can learn a lot about ourselves, and our evolutionary history.   Toward that end, it is critical that federal ESA protection be continued for these remarkable animals.

The intent was to create a spectacle, a public relations spike for San Francisco and competitive sailing, and a new narrative for an old contest that was assumed to be irrelevant in a world that cares only for extreme competition.But who was competing? The America's Cup has always been the playing field for well-to-do yachtsmen who, through their exclusive clubs, shaped challenges and boat designs for their pleasure. It was like tennis before Grand Slams, or dirt oval racing before NASCAR, or road racing before Formula One. Everyone wore white; the cars were decal-free; and the competition open even to a kid with a fast car and a dream.With television and the high stakes game of advertising revenue, sport has become a massive capital intensive enterprise that involves publicly funded stadiums, franchise trading, rights negotiations, multimillion dollar player contracts, and other exclusionary barriers that reduce the audience from participants to observers, a phenomenon that might well be (and is becoming) comparable to a passive video game with the high stakes rewards of having a winning fantasy team.To my mind, extreme sport is not sport at all. And in the context of The America's Cup and sailing, it matters only to a few egos gratified by unconscionable funds spent with no purpose other than self-indulgence. It employs almost no one, invades the airwaves for a few days of diversion and then regresses to petty squabbles, new legal challenges, richer budgets, and public confusion for a few years until it worms its way into our consciousness again.The ocean is a spectacular place for teaching and learning. Sea experience has formed the bodies, skills, values, and lives of young people for all time the world over. In the 19th century, the canoe was everyman's boat, carried on cars and in trains to rusticating places where people, old and young, rich and poor, could enjoy the natural environment, on the water, at an affordable cost. The ubiquitous sea kayak, roof racked on cars streaming highway toward the coast, are the modern equivalent. The renaissance of interest in construction of traditional boats has spread across the United States, into the Caribbean, through Europe, and to mid, near- and far-east where replicas of forgotten indigenous craft, typically of work boat origin, have assumed a recreational role accessible to many.For example, a decade ago in the Azores, the typical sailing whaleboat, as efficient and beautiful a craft ever devised, was as extinct as the whaling industry itself. There may have been one or two examples in museums or forgotten in local barns, but the builders were all retired and the whalemen relegated to caf\u00e9 tables and memories. Through an American intervention, one builder was brought from retirement to build, with a young apprentice, a new Azorian whaleboat, the first in what was to become more than 50 replicas sailing today in those waters with young people aboard reveling in the lessons that only successful study of the boat and the conditions can provide. Replicas were also built-in the New Bedford, Massachusetts region where many Azorian and other Portuguese families have migrated; a regatta for these vessels with American kids aboard was held just a few weeks ago.There are many other examples: in France, an explosion of traditional craft construction was driven by a culture magazine, Chasse Maree, in Brittany, that resulted in contests of seamanship in gigs with teams from 12 nations, or in vessels particular to one town's history newly constructed as a symbol of local tradition. More than 100 such vessels today meet and race in local and international festivals. La Semaine de Golfe is one such extraordinary gathering, in the protected inland bay of Mor Bihan, were hundreds of such vessels come together in a week-long celebration of boats and maritime tradition. Other such events occur at wooden boat shows on both coasts of the United States, at Brest and Dournanez, in France, and in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Scandinavia, around the Mediterranean, in Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Japan.The recreational opportunity of the ocean is for everyone. There is a wonderful saying, \"Messin' About in Boats,\" a description of a universal engagement between young people and small craft, first crude rafts, then models, then rowboats with sculling oar, then sail and pulling boats alongshore in every culture. There is a growing phenomenon call \"raids,\" gatherings of small boat owners, old and young, coming together to cruise quietly among islands, camping on beaches, and bonding through an authentic encounter with fellow mariners and the sea.That is a far cry from technical monsters, barely under control, at 40 knots, racing for a few minutes on foils for the indulgence of a few and a brief ephemeral television audience that is only a channel surf away from indifference.We will discuss these issues, and more, in future editions of World Ocean Radio."}, {"title": "EPA To Solicit Ideas For Carbon Emissions Regulations On 11-City 'Listening Tour'", "text": "(Recasts top paragraphs, adds comment from congressman, American Petroleum Institute)By Valerie VolcoviciWASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday kicked off an 11-city \"listening tour\" as part of its effort to craft emissions rules for existing power plants under the Obama administration's strategy to address climate change.States that already have plans in place to cut carbon pollution are likely to make the case that their programs offer a viable model for others.The tour started in New York and Atlanta, with meetings wrapping up on Nov. 8.The agency is expected to solicit ideas on how best to regulate carbon emissions from the more than 1,000 power plants now in operation. That is the cornerstone and arguably the most controversial part of the administration's program.The EPA will use a rarely employed section of the federal Clean Air Act, known as section 111(d), and will rely heavily on input from states to craft a flexible rule that can be applied to states with different energy profiles.President Barack Obama set a June 2014 deadline for the agency to propose its rules, which need to be finalized in June 2015.REGIONAL INITIATIVE AS ROLE MODELOfficials from some of the nine northeastern states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - a carbon trading program targeting power sector emissions - will make the case that the initiative has a \"plug and play\" option for states to meet future federal rules.\"We want to make the case ... that RGGI is fully compliant with section 111(d),\" said Collin O'Mara, secretary of the environment and energy for Delaware.Separately, representatives of California are expected to ask the EPA to endorse the state's economy-wide, carbon cap-and-trade system as compliant with future regulations.It is unclear whether the EPA will choose for its rule a \"rate-based\" approach - a standard for each plant to meet - or a \"mass-based approach,\" which would allow a state to get credit for cutting pollution across a variety of sectors.Delaware's O'Mara said he wants to make sure that RGGI states are credited for the \"mass-based\" approach they have taken. For 2010 through 2012, emissions in the states were, on average, more than 30 percent lower than in 2005.The regional initiative's approach has already drawn interest from several other states that want to join a program that has already been tried and tested.THREE-MINUTE SEGMENTSEach person who wants to make comments at the EPA sessions will be offered a three-minute slot, said Niloufar Nazmi Glosson, who is coordinating a listening session at the EPA's regional office in San Francisco on Nov. 5.The sessions are likely to attract speakers ranging from state officials to green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council to members of the National Association of Manufacturers, which opposes what it calls over-regulation by the EPA in tackling power plant emissions.California, which has had a $1 billion carbon market in place since January that targets stationary sources like power plants, will use the sessions to tout the benefits of its program.\"We will make the point that we think we have a pretty good model here and we invite them to take a further look at it,\" said one source in California who is close to the EPA process.LISTEN AND LEARNOther states will be in more the listen-and-learn mode, said Jennifer Macedonia, a senior adviser to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.Many \"will likely try to incorporate the lowest cost reduction measures, provide for a sufficiently long compliance phase-in to allow for a smooth transition and ensure that the program's requirements won't compromise the availability of affordable and reliable electricity,\" Macedonia said.Coal-reliant states such as Kentucky and Pennsylvania are already beginning to weigh options for complying with future EPA carbon-curbing rules.John Lyons, assistant secretary for climate policy for Kentucky, said this month that it would not make sense for a state like his, which relies on coal for 97 percent of its electricity, to shift completely to cleaner natural gas to meet future EPA standards.Pennsylvania's public utility commission has requested a meeting with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to talk about the deactivation of two major coal-fired power plants in the state. Both plants cited future EPA rules as a reason for shutting.Some lawmakers in coal-dependent regions have called on the EPA to hold listening sessions in areas that will be directly affected by carbon emission limits.Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said the EPA is preventing those whose livelihoods are at risk from new rules from speaking up.Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called on the EPA to hold additional sessions in coal-reliant states.People who attended Wednesday's New York session were largely in support of the EPA's plans, with the exception of a representative of the American Petroleum Institute.Howard Feldman, director of regulatory affairs for the lobby group, said it is concerned that the EPA's planned regulation \"goes beyond the authorization of Congress and the Clean Air Act.\" (Reporting By Valerie Volcovici; Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in San Francisco and Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Ros Krasny and Steve Orlofsky)"}, {"title": "Angela Pozzi Makes Her Art Out Of Our Trash", "text": "Last year, the Ocean Conservancy's coastal clean-up project collected more than 3.5 million pounds of trash from America's beaches in one day.For one artist and educator, the severity of America's marine debris problem was too much. \"In the last 10 years,\" Angela Pozzi writes on her website, WashedAshore.org, \"I have seen the pristine Oregon beaches of my childhood become cluttered with plastic pollution.

He loved the idea behind the sandals but found they were heavy and uncomfortable.So, like any good entrepreneur, he tracked down the woman who had made the sandals and refined his vision while working with her in a tiny factory she ran out of her home. After years of design experimentation and business development, Parsons and his business partners found a way to make light, comfortable and fashionable shoes -- all while employing Balinese workers and using sustainable materials.Indosole shoes and sandals are all made using repurposed motor bike tires. Motorbikes are the main mode of motorized transportation in Indonesia, and one of the largest contributors to the country's huge waste management problem. Millions of old tires are left in landfills that can\u2019t possibly sustain the load, and the country's lack of both infrastructure and waste-disposal education has led to overcrowded landfills, polluted ravines, streets, and eventually, ocean waters. A photographer captured tragic photographs of waves of trash barrelling off Java this summer.Indosole takes the tires directly from local landfills. They are washed, sanitized and cut to shoe size. Indosole claims to have saved over 16,000 tires from landfills since their launch in 2010. Each tire makes about two pairs of shoes.All of the shoes are constructed in a local factory overseen by Indosole\u2019s vice-president. (Indosole\u2019s do-gooder competitor, Toms, uses factories in three different countries.) The factory uses no animal products (the sandal straps use \u201cvegan\u201d suede) and no fuel-powered machinery (the shoes are 100% handcrafted). Workers are paid a living wage with benefits and no one works night shifts.Repurposed materials are used wherever possible. (Repurposing, the lesser-employed cousin of recycling, is typically greener than recycling as it skips the reprocessing step.) Repurposing the motorbike rubber means that the rubber is not melted down, thus preventing gas byproducts. Repurposed burlap coffee bags provide the fabric for some of the sandals, while others are made from traditional Indonesian batik fabrics.Apparel manufacturing lends itself to all kinds of sustainability nightmares: inefficient supply chains, exploited workers, wasteful choices in materials, huge emissions. By employing what they already have, where they already have it, Indosole has figured out how to be a truly sustainable company."}, {"title": "Veterans Join Efforts to Protect Rivers and Wild Lands in the Los Padres National Forest", "text": "Jon Soltz served in the Army in Kosovo and Iraq. In 2011, he was one of the last troops to leave the country. Upon his return home that year -- his second tour of Iraq -- fishing became an important part of his life.\"Fishing is an outlet for me,\" he says. \"Nothing is more relaxing than being on the water.\"Like many veterans, Soltz faced some adjustments upon returning to civilian life. Being in the outdoors, especially fishing, has become a big part of his strategy for coping with these challenges. And Soltz found the outdoors readily accessible -- and plenty of good fishing -- in America's public lands.So Soltz, through his own experiences with war and readjustment, founded a veterans' organization in 2009 to help keep public lands and waters protected and accessible. His brainchild is Vet Voice Foundation, a national veterans' advocacy group that works to improve conservation policy and connect veterans to the outdoors.Soltz says, \"Many veterans have a natural love of the outdoors. We fish, hunt, hike and otherwise enjoy our public lands with friends and family members. And getting outdoors is a wonderful way to reintegrate when we return home from war.\"He adds, \"America's public lands are an important part of our national heritage, a heritage that veterans have defended since Teddy Roosevelt -- himself a distinguished military veteran -- established our first national forests and monuments more than a century ago.\"Vet Voice Foundation builds partnerships with other national and local groups working to conserve public lands. One such partnership, with the national sportsmen's organization Trout Unlimited, has produced a series of outings with veterans and fishing guides in California trout streams to highlight the importance of public lands for veterans and for fishing opportunities.On October 19, 2013, Vet Voice Foundation and Trout Unlimited hosted a vets fishing outing on Lake Cachuma, in the Santa Ynez Valley in California, near Santa Barbara. Soltz came all the way from Washington, D.C. to be there -- it was a day of fishing, after all.\"There is a deep bond between the sportsmen and veteran communities,\" he said while trolling for fish deep in the lake. \"And conservation is the key to keeping the places we love to hunt and fish in good condition, so that our kids and future generations of vets will have the same opportunities that we have today.\"On Lake Cachuma, veterans from all over southern California came to spread this gospel. They were joined by representatives from Trout Unlimited, local fishing groups, and the Central Coast Wild Heritage Campaign. Lake Cachuma is fed by streams that flow from the Los Padres National Forest, and the event organizers called for permanent protection of Mono and Indian Creeks and the Santa Ynez River.Jessica Strickland, California Field Coordinator for Trout Unlimited, helped organize the event. She brought her brother, who was recently discharged from the Navy, to Lake Cachuma. \"If you are a fisherman,\" said Strickland, you care about water -- where it comes from, its temperature and quality. It's vitally important to protect feeder streams like Mono and Indian creeks so that they will continue to deliver cold, clean water to downstream fisheries and keep places like Lake Cachuma productive.\"Vet Voice Foundation has worked for several years to protect portions of the Los Padres National Forest. In addition to certain streams, VVF wants to protect the Condor Ridge area as Wilderness. The area that is proposed for Wilderness designation is over 18,000 acres, and boasts magnificent views of the Gaviota Coast, Channel Islands and Santa Ynez Valley.Rick Reyes and Mario Rivas, from southeast Los Angeles, answered the call on the 19th. Both men, veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, have previously been involved with VVF's work to support protection of the San Gabriel Mountains and Angeles National Forest, an area in their backyard.Rivas believes the effort to protect these fishing areas and proposed wilderness are of equal importance. \"Public lands belong to us all,\" he said. \"As veterans, we want to see these lands protected for future generations, after all, we served overseas to ensure these lands and this country remain free.\"Vitali Mostovoj, a retired Air Force officer and resident of Ventura County, has volunteered with VVF since its inception and was at Lake Cachuma with a fishing rod in his hand all day. Mostovoj participated in the event with his son, Andy, who like his father served on active duty in the Army as an officer.Mostovoj emigrated from Germany after the Second World War. His love of the outdoors began as a child in this country. \"I was amazed with the wide open spaces and wild lands of America,\" he said. \"I have always had a passion for getting outdoors and this was something that I introduced to my son at a very young age.\" Father and son have frequented many national parks and other public lands over the years and have used these visits as a means to bond.Mostovoj said protecting the Los Padres National Forest is particularly important to him, as it is very close to his home in Thousand Oaks. Referring to the support of local members of Congress for creating new designations for some parts of the Los Padres, he added, \"I am very happy that both Representatives Lois Capps and Julia Brownley are committed to protecting this area.\"Fishing is big business in California. The state has more than two million licensed anglers, who contribute more than $2.1 billion annually to the state's economy. According to a 2013 study by the Outdoor Industry Association, outdoor recreation of all varieties generates $85 Billion in consumer spending in the Golden State and supports more than 700,000 jobs.Soltz, Chairman of VVF and avid fisherman and conservationist, had a smile on his face the whole day. \"Our veterans, sportsmen and local businesses depend on our public lands,\" he said. \"We've got to make sure our national parks, forests, lakes and rivers stay in good shape and accessible for veterans, who have sacrificed so much to defend our homeland. The voice of the veterans' community is making a difference on this issue and VVF is proud to be a part of this effort.\""}, {"title": "Don't Mind the Cold -- It's Still Getting Hotter", "text": "Sometimes, it's all too easy to be frustrated by a unseasonably cold summer day and think, \"Global warming? Not today, at least.\" This summer has seen a handful of days of that nature, but even when temperatures aren't as hot as we've come to expect, it's important to keep in mind that one cold day does not a pattern make.Take this past June for example. According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, June 2013 was the fifth warmest June since 1880 and the 37th consecutive June with a global temperature over the 20th century average. The global average temperature for land and ocean surfaces in June 2013 was a combined 1.06 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average of 56.3 degrees Fahrenheit.It seems like with each passing month, new evidence in support of global warming is created. Despite 2013's conformity with decades of rising temperatures, it appears that a few cold days here and there have a fortuitous effect on public opinion. According to the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, the percentage of Americans who believe global warming is happening dropped from 70 percent to 63.The up-and-down weather of 2013 may also explain a drop in concern over global warming; 51 percent of Americans say they are \"somewhat\" or \"very\" worried about global warming, down 7 percent from Fall 2012.What's the explanation for so many Americans becoming prisoners of the moment and ignoring strong scientific trends and the scientific community? Can a cool summer day or cloudy weekend really sway public opinion this much?Some media outlets have claimed global warming is slowing down or even stopped, but such claims range from incomplete to wholly inaccurate. The rate of global surface temperature warming has indeed slowed, but that only tells a tiny part of the story. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, over 93 percent of the planet's excess energy is swallowed up by oceans, making seawater easily the largest heat \"sink\" on Earth.While the theory that temporary stretches of cold can alter public perception of global warming may be partially true, a better explanation is that there's a misconception that global warming will only cause major changes and increased extreme weather events in a few places, and most of those places are far away.Out of sight, out of mind, as the saying goes.The World Bank Group does indeed identify poor countries as the biggest victims of global warming, but that doesn't mean all or any of the First World is safe. California, a state with a GDP larger than Italy, had its driest January-April on record, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains only received a paltry 18 percent of its normal snowpack.The average climate denier might rationalize that one dry year is an anomaly and the biggest effect of decreased snowpack on the Sierra Nevada is postcards that aren't quite as picturesque, but that would be forgetting one daunting fact: The Sierra Nevada provides about one-third of California's water.California wasn't alone in having an unusually dry winter and spring, as over half of the contiguous U.S. was in drought at the start of August. A drought may not capture as many headlines as climate-charged hurricanes and tsunamis, but regardless of the deniers, the planet is \"locked in\" to climate change for years to come. Don't let a few chilly summer days change your mind on the reality and severity of the predicament."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - October 22, 2013", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport FACEBOOK: Green News Report The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: China choking on toxic air; Air pollution causing lung cancer everywhere; Anti-fracking protests spread across Europe...and turn violent in Canada, while France holds the line; PLUS: Some good news: US carbon emissions falling for the 5th year in a row ...

As came as little surprise to anyone remotely familiar with the issue, the Commission's report indicated that industrial livestock production poses serious threats to human health, the environment, rural communities and animal welfare. After describing these problems in great detail (think 122 pages of white-paper-tiny text replete with endnotes and parenthetical references), the report provided a series of recommendations for mitigating the adverse impacts of this sector of the food system.Today, Johns Hopkins University Center for a Livable Future (CLF) released a new report assessing the impact of the Commission's recommendations and the progress toward implementation made over the last five years. As will come as little surprise to anyone remotely familiar with the current state of the U.S. meat, egg and dairy industries, CLF's report reveals that industrial livestock production is still just as destructive as it was five years ago, and that despite the continual emergence of new scientific evidence demonstrating the severity of the threats it poses, remarkably little has actually been done to address any of the problems.According to Dr. Robert Lawrence, director of CLF, \"There has been an appalling lack of progress. The failure to act by the USDA and FDA, the lack of action or concern by the Congress and continued intransigence of the animal agriculture industry have made all of our problems worse.\"It's important to note that Dr. Lawrence and his colleagues at CLF aren't the types to cry wolf; they're prudent, thoughtful, painstakingly diligent public health experts whose work, unlike that sold by the agribusiness lobby's hired guns, is rooted deeply in sound science and academic integrity. So when CLF declares that a problem is serious, it warrants immediate attention. Somehow, though, it seems that policymakers never got the memo; as described in today's report, the regulatory response to the Commission's 2008 recommendations has been woefully inadequate. In fact, report authors decry an \"assault on reforms\" in Congress and argue that regulatory agencies have acted \"regressively.\"Today's report assesses the progress (or, more accurately, the shocking lack thereof) made toward meeting the Commission's six priority recommendations from 2008:Paradoxically, the appalling lack of progress made toward addressing the serious concerns described in the Pew Commission's 2008 report occurred over a time period when public awareness of (and interest in) food and agriculture issues had never been greater. Indeed, there exists a bizarre disconnect between members of the public, who continually express dissatisfaction with the industrial food system and increasingly choose to avoid the products it generates, and their elected officials, who've not only failed to address the threats posed by industrial livestock production, but in many cases, have actually exacerbated the problems through deregulation, misappropriation of right-to-farm laws, creation of ag-gag legislation and other policy decisions that benefit industry at the expense of the greater social good.The implications of CLF's report were perhaps best summarized by the Commission's executive director, Bob Martin, who lamented the regulatory void, noting, \"Inaction was inexcusable five years ago, now it is unconscionable.\""}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Dogs Dead From Eating Jerky Treats; FDA Isn't Exactly Sure Why", "text": "Nearly 600 dogs and cats have died and 3,600 more have been sickened since 2007 as a result of eating poisonous jerky treats, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Tuesday. The agency used the opportunity to put out a call to pet owners to assist in gathering information about the cause of the scourge.The number of illnesses and deaths -- the vast majority of which have affected dogs -- have risen since January, when the FDA reported more than 3,200 dogs and cats had been sick and over 500 died, apparently from eating chicken, duck, sweet potato and fruit-flavored jerky treats, many of which are imported from China.While the federal agency continues to investigate, it has not yet determined exactly why so many pets are getting sick.\"This is one of the most elusive and mysterious outbreaks we've encountered,\" FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine Director Bernadette Dunham said in a statement on the agency's website.The FDA noted that reports of pets sickened from jerky treats have declined since a number of jerky products for pets were taken off shelves in January. The decision to pull the snacks came after a New York lab found trace amounts of six types of antibiotics in chicken jerky treats made in China, five of which are banned in the U.S.Still, the agency said that the levels of the drugs detected by the lab were very low and therefore had not likely caused the deaths. It also said that visits to the Chinese factories associated with the highest number of pet illnesses did not completely answer questions surrounding the deaths, and that the issue may lie with suppliers of certain ingredients to those plants.One Chinese pet treat maker, however, was forbidden from exporting by Chinese regulators after it was found that it had falsified records for glycerin, one of the ingredients in the treats, The Chicago Tribune reported.The FDA said it continues to test jerky products for chemical contaminants and continues to meet with Chinese regulators and U.S. pet food companies to share information.The agency recommends that owners who feed their pets jerky treats should be on the lookout for signs of decreased appetite, decreased activity, vomiting, diarrhea, increased water consumption and increased urination in their pets.If your pet may have been sickened by eating jerky products, report your findings to the FDA by calling 1-888-INFO-FDA."}, {"title": "U.S. Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Energy Consumption Drop To Lowest Level Since 1994", "text": "From Climate Central's Bobby Magill:U.S. carbon dioxide emissions related to energy consumption dropped to their lowest point since 1994 last year, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report released Monday afternoon.The decline of coal as a power source in favor of natural gas in the U.S. is a big part of that decline, the EIA reported.Natural gas power generation increased by 211.8 billion kilowatt hours in 2012 over 2011, while coal power declined by 215.2 billion kilowatt hours last year.The EIA reported that 2012 was the fifth year in a row that energy related carbon emissions declined after peaking in 2007, despite GDP growth.

The explosive blowout that tragically claimed the lives of 11 workers on board the rig in April 2010 also unleashed an unprecedented amount of oil that flowed uncontrolled into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. The impacts have been staggering and ongoing.BP's actions to stop the oil, as well as how much actually spewed into the Gulf, were the subject of the second phase of BP's trial in New Orleans, which concluded last week. The final phase of the trial will take place next year, after which the judge will determine the penalties. In the meantime, here are some things you need to know.In the days and months following the spill, BP was everywhere on the Gulf Coast, promising everyone from Governors to subsistence fishers that they were here for the long haul. \"Make it right\" became a mantra not only for BP but for the people living on the Gulf, a phrase repeated over and over to calm the fears that life would never be the same.At first, it looked like \"make it right\" wasn't just a slogan. BP opened its checkbook to pay for one of the largest response efforts in U.S. history. Granted, some would say cleaning up the mess you made is simply a matter of good manners. But nevertheless, BP was there. Further evidence of making good on their promise came in 2011, when BP and our Natural Resource Trustees announced $1 billion for early restoration, a down payment on what will likely be a total bill of $20 billion to restore the impacted natural resources - and the people's lost use of those resources - in the region.Fast forward to today, and it is clear that BP is no longer interested in full responsibility for their actions leading up to and during the oil disaster. Indeed, BP grows more intransigent every day. These days, they are focused on painting themselves, through a well-funded PR campaign, as the victims of greedy, fraudulent Gulf residents and politicians. \"Make it right\" has become \"haven't we've done enough?\"BP has launched a PR campaign designed to shore up the company's assertion that they have done enough and to point fingers at Gulf residents, saying that many of the claims made as a result of losses incurred during the disaster are fraudulent and that the company has gone above and beyond in response and restoration. They took out full-page ads in several national newspapers asserting that they are being victimized.Certainly, restoration efforts always face a handful of claims to fund irrelevant projects - just like any program that provides money. But BP is trying to put this extreme minority in the center of the debate.Also telling is the fact that their ad campaign moved into full swing in Washington during the month before phase two of the trial. According to The Hill, \"Given that much of the advertising is in Washington, it may also be aimed at garnering political support to lessen pending Clean Water Act fines that are the subject of the ongoing federal trial.\"The bottom line: BP is no longer acting in good faith. They're gambling that if they dig their heels in for long enough, they will pay much less in the long run.What, precisely, is at stake during this phase of the trial? The amount of Clean Water Act fines that BP will have to pay. The official U.S. government estimate is that BP spilled 4.2 million barrels of oil. BP denies this and says they spilled about half that much. Penalties for discharging oil (a violation of the Clean Water Act) are based on the amount of oil discharged. A lower volume means a lower penalty -- potentially around $7 billion less.Ultimately, the amount of money available for restoration of the Gulf of Mexico via the RESTORE Act comes down to two things: How much oil did BP discharge, and were they grossly negligent in the actions leading up to and during the disaster? Presiding U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier will decide the fines, as well as the cause of the disaster and BP's level of negligence.It does not require a court decision, however, to arrive at the simple conclusion that BP must pay -- and that it should pay in full -- for restoration of the Gulf. BP has veered off the path it was on 3 years ago to take responsibility for the damage it caused. They want to play hardball now, and the people and wildlife of the Gulf stand to lose big if they succeed.So my ask to BP is simple: Put your money where your mouth is, and keep your promise to make things right in the Gulf. (And in the short term, Judge Barbier should ensure that BP is held accountable to the full extent of the law.) My ask to the people reading this article is also simple: Join me and thousands of other people and tell them."}, {"title": "Sandy A Warning Rising Seas Threaten Nuclear Plants", "text": "As Hurricane Sandy barreled ashore a year ago, the storm forced the shutdown of several Northeast coastal nuclear power reactors, including the Oyster Creek plant on the Jersey Shore, which took the brunt of Sandy's huge storm surge.Read more on Climate Central"}, {"title": "Will the Black Market Continue to Thrive Due to Over Taxation of Recreational Marijuana?", "text": "When campaigning for the passing of Washington's Initiative 502 and Colorado's Amendment 64, supporters of the now enacted laws were boasting how the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes could generate much needed tax revenue.

Said prediction bases the production costs of each gram at $2, with yet another summary calculating the costs at $3 a gram.According to the Price of Weed's website, which is a site that collects datum from marijuana consumers nationwide, the price for a high-quality ounce of the kind in the state of Washington would cost you approximately $239.In a nutshell, if BOTEC's projections are accurate, the end price for an ounce of state-authorized bud will be nearly two to three times as much as purchasing a sack from the black market.\"That's a big problem,\" Mark Kleiman avowed, adviser to Washington's marijuana regulators. \"The legal market is going to have a hard time competing with the illegal market, but a particularly hard time competing with the untaxed, unregulated sort-of-legal market (medical marijuana).\"Supporters of the marijuana taxes contend that they're required in order to fund an effective regulatory system, which in turn will assist in dispiriting intervention from the federal government.Denver attorney and longtime marijuana activist, Rob Corry, argues that disproportionately high taxes will challenge the tax guidelines by propagating the black market. \"Over-taxation creates a marijuana market ripe for takeover by the unregulated, untaxed, underground market,\" Corry explained.Legislators in both Washington and Colorado still maintain the powers to adjust the final tax rates, but greed could play a vital role in terms of the willingness of said legislators to reduce the rates. Will high taxes pose a threat to the success of these newly enacted laws? Only time will tell.Check out the free The 420 Times iPhone and iPad App on the iTunes Store and Android App available on Google Play.

They walked over and spotted an old, dirty dog crate tucked away in a corner, surrounded by junk. They thought it had been trashed, but when they turned to leave, a dog locked inside the crate began whining, thumping his tail and jumping in excitement. When they approached, they saw that there were two dogs in the carrier -- and one of them wasn't moving.Credit:PETAInside was a gut-wrenching sight: the dead body of a brindle pit bull named Dynasty, so emaciated that every bone was clearly visible. The surviving dog, a male pit bull mix named Blue, was so cramped inside the crate that he could not avoid stepping on Dynasty's remains. Blue was also underweight, and his white paws were stained yellow from standing in the urine that soaked the floor of the crate.Credit:PETAThe volunteers called the police, and the dogs were eventually relinquished to PETA. Dynasty was necropsied for evidentiary purposes, and Blue was adopted into a loving home. The dogs' owner, Adriane Mason, was indicted and found guilty of cruelty to animals. The presiding judge was so moved that he said he wished he could impose on Mason a sentence similar to the one that Mason had imposed on his dogs -- confining him to a crate without food or water in the middle of winter -- but, the judge remarked, that would amount to \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"Animals like Blue depend on us to keep our eyes peeled for them. That chained, skinny dog you pass every day on your way to work may have no one else to count on for help. Luckily, there is usually some legal recourse for neglected animals. Owners are required by law to provide animals with food, water and adequate shelter, so if we see animals deprived of these necessities, our call to authorities and our persistence can result in their rescue.In situations that are cruel but still legal, many good Samaritans have succeeded by persuading owners to take dogs indoors and let them live with their human family. A polite approach works best, so start by befriending the dog's owners, even if it's an uphill struggle. Try complimenting their kids or their car or offering to help shovel their driveway. Then gradually begin talking to them in a nonconfrontational way about what dogs need. You could relate your experiences with your own dog or mention that you recently learned that dogs are pack animals who thrive on spending time indoors with their families. You may be pleasantly surprised to see your neighbors making an effort to improve conditions after just one conversation.If they won't allow their dogs indoors, you may be able to persuade them to let you visit regularly to take their dog for a walk, give him or her toys and treats, or play fetch in the backyard without encroaching on their time. While these things are no substitute for a loving home, they mean the world to dogs who are forced to live in solitary confinement.Sometimes, all it takes is one phone call to save an animal's life. That was the case with Noel, who was tethered to the trunk of a thorn bush, unable to move more than 10 inches in any direction and shivering violently in the December cold.She had no shelter, no water and no food except for a few pieces of stale kibble that were scattered on the ground, out of her reach. Scabs and open sores covered her ears and tail and her ribs and hip bones protruded sharply.A call from a compassionate neighbor had PETA's fieldworkers on the road in minutes. They rushed Noel to a veterinarian, who confirmed that she had been starved. After treatment, Noel was placed with an experienced foster guardian, and she quickly gained 17 pounds and started to trust humans again. Eventually, Noel was adopted by the Virginia Beach SPCA's youth programs director, who reported that the formerly shy dog is now the \"sweetest, sloppiest kiss-giving, bedtime snuggler.\"A judge sentenced Noel's abuser to 40 hours of community service, one year of supervised probation and, most importantly, a lifetime ban on ever owning animals again.Credit:PETABlue and Noel now get to go on leisurely walks during which they are allowed to smell the roses. They have toys to play with or chew, balls to chase, full stomachs and happy hearts. They are loved and respected. But there are still plenty of dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals languishing in backyards, basements and garages across the country, alone and unloved. People who check on them and notify authorities of abuse aren't \"nosy neighbors\" -- they're guardian angels."}, {"title": "Undo New Carbon Rules? No Way.", "text": "Now that the government shutdown is over (for now) and debt default avoided (for now), the Tea Party extremists in Congress will likely get back to their more typical day jobs of denying climate change and trying to undermine environmental protection. In the midst of the shutdown we told you on our Facebook page about legislation introduced by Rep. David McKinley of West Virginia that would, if enacted, undo recently proposed rules to limit carbon pollution at new coal-fired power plants.The resolution, H.J. 64, was introduced pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA allows for Congress to formally \"disapprove\" of major rules issued by executive agencies. Passage of a CRA resolution results in the rule not going into effect and prevents the agency from ever promulgating a substantially similar rule again. Keep in mind, agencies issue rules pursuant to the laws previously passed by Congress. And realize that McKinley's legislative weapon of choice may only disapprove final rules, not mere proposed rules like the one released by EPA for public input. But setting aside this obvious defect, if the McKinley resolution were to succeed, EPA's hands would be tied in implementing a key part of the Clean Air Act's direction to limit the harm of a dangerous air pollutant (carbon) because EPA would be prohibited from issuing a similar rule to limit carbon coming from new power plants.While McKinley may be getting support from his coal industry supporters, it's important for fans of a stable climate to keep in mind that this bill has little support outside of the extreme Tea Party wing of Congress and those with vested interests in building new, dirty coal plants. Here are a few reminders for representatives who might be considering sponsoring the McKinley resolution:1. Americans of all political stripes want to ACT on climate. The most recent polling finds that 87 percent of Americans support some EPA action on climate change, including 78 percent of Republicans and 94 percent of Democrats.2. Doomed to fail. Congress has considered CRA resolutions that attempted to undermine climate action and the Clean Air Act recently. Each time a majority of senators has rejected these dangerous attempts to harm public health.3. President Obama cares about climate change. \"Today, for the sake of our children, and the health and safety of all Americans, I'm directing the Environmental Protection Agency to put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants, and complete new pollution standards for both new and existing power plants.\" President Obama uttered these words in his June speech on climate change. The President has the authority to veto a CRA resolution. There is no way President Obama would participate in undermining something he explicitly directed EPA to do.It's time for Congress to get to work, solving the real problems that face this country. They should stop wasting time on efforts that are both unpopular and unlikely to succeed. The question for you, dear readers, is whether your representatives know how you feel on this issue."}, {"title": "Innovation Earth: Green Bus To The Rescue", "text": "Next Tuesday, it will have been one year since the monstrous Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast, killing 117 people in the U.S., destroying thousands of homes and wreaking $65 billion in damage. And while this year's hurricane season has been thankfully quiet so far, it does have some now questioning global warming's role in all of this; that is, whether climate change will actually increase, or decrease, the likelihood of Superstorm Sandy-type storms.I say forget all that. Now would be a good time to revisit a recent study led by Katie Arkema at Stanford and co-authored by Peter Kareiva, provocative chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy (read his essay on how conservationists need to change their tune, here), that highlights the real problem when it comes to hurricanes: our coastline, increasingly being made more vulnerable to any tropical storm, thanks to sea level rise and habitat loss.According to the study, 16 percent of U.S coastline -- home to 1.3 million people and $300 billion in residential property -- can now be qualified as \"high-hazard.\" But this number will increase anywhere from 30 to 60 percent by the end of the century, depending on the level of sea rise as a result of climate change -- putting an additional 1.7 to 2.1 million people at risk, along with $400 to $500 billion in residential property. Loss of protective natural habitat like sand dunes and coral reefs compounds the risk even further, most especially for poor families and the elderly.In the world as it could be, we would be doing everything in our power to protect that coastline (preserving natural habitat being more effective than any solution we could engineer, the study says) so that we wouldn't have to face a Hurricane Sandy scenario every season. But reality check time: We're already losing habitat worldwide at an alarming rate. Federal disaster relief costs have risen astronomically in the past three decades. We are going to have to find an efficient way to deal with the aftermath of these storms.Enter Veterans Green Bus. Started by Gordon Soderberg, a U.S. Navy veteran with over 30 years of disaster response experience, his Crown Coach conversion can run 3,500 miles on a single fill-up of biodiesel or waste veggie oil (WVO, not to be confused with EVOO) and is equipped with solar windows that power its refrigeration. In the works: A satellite internet system that can run through the evening via solar-charged batteries.Conceived by Soderberg while serving as a volunteer post-Hurricane Katrina (he built a small-scale biodiesel plant there to run equipment to keep lots cleared), the bus was purchased in 2010 and deployed for the first time during Hurricane Sandy at the behest of veterans service organization Team Rubicon, for which Soderberg served as a volunteer.For the response to Sandy, the Green Bus (lovingly nicknamed Large Marge) transported volunteers to Rockaway Beach, Queens from Detroit and Chicago, as well as delivered much-needed tool donations from Home Depot. And while the bus may have appeared stripped down, the work inside was high-tech. In Rockaway, volunteer veterans used military grade geo-mapping and analysis software to assess Sandy's damage and keep track of the relief efforts.Soderberg and the Green Bus also worked alongside FEMA, the Red Cross, and other government aid and nonprofit agencies, powering communication equipment and serving as office space for logistical staff -- most notably hosting former President Clinton for a briefing.Those bigger organizations, however, seem to have missed out on something obvious to Soderberg: That a huge portion of any organization's disaster relief budget is spent (nay, wasted) on fuel. Fuel to transport volunteers to the disaster site and truck in supplies, fuel to run Bobcats to clear debris, fuel to run the generators. With diesel fuel close to $4 a gallon, those costs add up pretty quickly. \"In the 30 years I've done disaster relief, I've never seen a fuel company donate fuel,\" Soderberg quips.Converting vehicles to run on WVO may seem quaint in an era of hybrid and electric vehicles, but electricity isn't usually readily available in the aftermath of a disaster like Sandy. Neither is conventional fuel. After Sandy, dry pumps left volunteers waiting hours for a fill-up at one of New York City's few working gas stations. Using a fuel source that's free, abundant and located close to relief workers -- like used cooking oil from local restaurants happy to contribute to relief efforts -- just makes sense.In the future, one imagines a whole fleet of these high-tech sustainable response vehicles on hand to deploy to any natural disaster. But first, Soderberg needs your help. He's trying to secure a permanent home for the Green Bus in Detroit, in a shuttered fire station now up for auction. There, the plan is to convert the building to house more disaster response vehicles, as well as the veterans who are going through the organization's training program.

Instead, Seifert presented a storyline that didn't stop at the health impacts of GMOs but used the GMO as a lens for understanding industrial agriculture: the profit-driven mission to manipulate seeds for higher yields.To get you there, GMO OMG! flows more like Planet Earth than Super Size Me! In one memorable scene, time-lapse footage of the night sky accompanies narration of a lesson learned in Haiti, \"The seeds of life are the common inheritance of all humanity, as numerous and diverse as the stars above, owned by none and shared by all.\"The immediate response was predictably polarized: Dr. Oz invited Seifert on his show to share his findings but top environmental writers at The New York Times and The New Yorker took issue with Seifert's lack of scientific information, describing the film and its moments above as \"an oversimplified survey\" and \"aggressively uniformed.\"It's easy to request \"more scientific proof\" of Seifert but, in doing so, the viewer misses out on the point he's making with his cultural questions, which expose the grossly uneven power dynamics that shape agro-science. In this light, it's clear that the point of this film is not to prove whether or not GMOs pose specific health threats. Siefert's mission is to explore what GMOs say about us.Seifert contrasts reactions to GMOs that span culture and discipline. His personal quest of deciding whether or not to feed them to his children turns political on a trip to Papaye, Haiti, a hub of the anti-GMO movement, The Peasant Movement of Papaye.He watched as Haitian farmers threw out and even burned bags of donated seeds from Monsanto. The farmers who planted them noticed that they grew horribly because their farms didn't have the chemical inputs that the hybrid seeds were designed to accompany. Unwilling to ask Monsanto for more, they resisted the aid.\"They were fighting for something that we had lost without even knowing that we were giving it up,\" said Seifert during our interview. This moment of questioning the power of agro-science and what we might have given up along the way drives the film.Seifert's research is in frequent conversation with his seven-year-old, who shows the audience how anyone can grow food from a seed: all you need to do is save your seeds for next year. On their way to the Monsanto headquarters, he's astonished when his father tells him that saving Monsanto seeds is illegal. The first things one gives up with the GMO seed, then, is the power to sustain one's own food system using traditional farming knowledge, a human right referred to, broadly, as food sovereignty.With that, we lose small farmers (farmers now represent less than 1 percent of the U.S. population) and gain agro-scientists and monocultures. In conversations with both large scale and small scale-organic farmers, we see how, over time, business and science replaced the 'culture' in agriculture.What revolutionaries in Papaye understand is that we can't be taken out of that equation. Worldwide, we see how GMOs disrupt culture. As explained by Dr. Vandana Shiva, GMOs are devastating India's cotton belt, where cotton farmers commit more suicides each year as their production becomes more and more tied to Monsanto. Farmers here struggle against \"yield lag\" where production soars in the first year, but by the next year, bugs and weeds resist the seed's chemicals.Seifert's scientific research comes from the Rodale Institute, which showed that side by side, over 30 years, organic farming outperforms industrial GMO farming. A UN report, cited by the Rodale Institute, estimates that agro-ecological farming methods could double global food production in 10 years. A recent large-scale study conducted by the UK Government studied 40 sustainable farming projects in 20 African countries (cited by the Rodale Report), revealed that that food production doubled over just 10 years.The other long-term study Seifert looked at was Dr. Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini's research on the effects of GMOs on rats (who were fed RoundUp Ready corn and RoundUp herbicide). Although The New Yorker criticized Seifert's use of the study, claiming it \"widely denounced throughout the world,\" it was the only long-term study on the effects of GMOs not produced by GMO companies themselves. All rats were infested with tumors by the end of their lifespan (seen most severely in female rats).Scientific debates aside, the GMO frames the American way of eating in alarming terms: We are mechanized eaters (85 percent of our processed foods contain GMOs) dependant on mechanized farmers -- less than 1 percent of our population -- to feed us. Do we wish this on the rest of the world?To feed the world we don't need GMOs, monocultures, processed foods, or the simultaneous hunger and obesity they create. Instead, we need more small farmers. They practice the art of agriculture that we can't afford to lose.Originally published on Food Politic: Journal of Food News and CultureAly Miller also had a chance to interview GMO OMG! director Jeremy Seifert in October 2013.

Local news outlet KUTV reports that, in the lawsuit, Taylor claims the accident injured his back and caused him \"loss of joy of life.\"Mcdonald, however, has now told KUTV that multiple cars were involved in the 2009 accident, and that no one went to the hospital.\"Someone with a bad back who's disabled, who can't enjoy life, to me, doesn't step up and push a rock that big off the base,\" Macdonald elaborated to ABC.Video of Taylor and fellow Boy Scout leader Dave Hall toppling the one-ton rock in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park went viral after it was uploaded to Facebook last week. Such formations, known as \"goblins\" or \"hoodoos,\" are formed by erosion over the course of millions of years. Taylor, however, said the rock was a danger to visitors and that he did a civic service by knocking it over.Taylor and Hall have both been removed from their posts by the Boy Scouts, one of whose main principles is \"Leave No Trace.\"Utah Parks authorities and the Emery County Attorney's Office are both currently deciding whether criminal charges should be filed, The Associated Press reported Monday.Taylor's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post.WATCH the video of Taylor knocking the rock off its base in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park:"}, {"title": "'We All Inhabit the Same Island'", "text": "The following is the World Energy Day Address delivered by Ambassador Marlene Moses at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.Good morning, everyone, and let me say what a privilege it is to be here at the World Energy Forum.Energy -- its production and consumption; its power to create and, too often unfortunately, its capacity to destroy -- lies at the center of much of what we do as members of an international body dedicated to building a more peaceful and prosperous world for present and future generations.Today (\"World Energy Day\") thus serves as an important reminder that the decisions we make when it comes to how we use energy have substantial implications for our efforts in a number of other areas of concern, such as combating poverty, maintaining international peace and security, and, ultimately, ensuring that we bequeath a suitable environment to our children and grandchildren.We have known for some time now that greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels, are responsible for dangerous global warming and that the resulting impacts -- such as extreme droughts and floods, ocean acidification, and sea level rise -- have already caused tremendous suffering, particularly among people from developing countries who are the least responsible for causing the crisis.We also know that the impacts threaten to undermine sustainable development itself, as storms and erosion damage critical infrastructure and ecological degradation takes a toll on water supplies, fisheries, and agricultural resources.So the challenge we face is really two complicated dilemmas folded into one: that is, we need to find ways to provide reliable energy to billions of impoverished people without relying on fossil fuels to do it.In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, unless we dramatically transform the way we produce and consume energy by 2017, we are on track to \"lock-in\" enough carbon dioxide emissions to send the average global temperature soaring past 2 degrees Celsius or more.Once that point is reached, to keep the mercury from climbing even higher and unthinkable catastrophes that would follow, we would either have to ensure that all additional energy infrastructure is carbon neutral or begin retiring factories and power plants before the end of their useful economic lives.So we have a massive problem ahead of us, and very little time to solve it, but just as the problems of energy and poverty are linke, so too are the solutions.Consider, as an example, the situation faced by many Small Island Developing States, the context with which I am most familiar.Many of us find ourselves in the unfortunate position of being uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and, due to our small size and isolation, highly dependent on fossil fuel imports. Fuel deliveries and logistics are further complicated by lack of modern port facilities and our small size prohibits the benefits of scale enjoyed by larger countries. As a result, SIDS are subject to some of the world's highest fuel costs, which in some cases can approach half of annual expenditures.However, this same geography has many of us well positioned to reap the benefits of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal. At the same time, building renewable energy systems frees up much needed resources for other investments, like healthcare and education while putting us on a pathway for long-term independence.In the low-lying Pacific atoll of Tuvalu, after successive droughts nearly exhausted its water supply, officials worked with partners to bring in solar-powered desalination equipment in 2011. The Island Nation hopes to be able to satisfy all of its energy demands using low-carbon technology by 2020.In the Indian Ocean, Mauritius, a nation blessed with abundant sunshine and rainfall, now generates about 15 percent of its electricity using a byproduct of sugarcane known as bagasse. It has plans to increase the renewables in its energy portfolio to at least 35 percent by 2025.While on Dominica in Caribbean, feasibility studies suggest the country could become a net exporter of electricity by tapping into the simmering geothermal power beneath it. It would like to be carbon neutral by 2020.In isolation, these actions would do little to stem the tide of climate change -- our islands account for only a small fraction of global emissions and implementing the projects required strong collaborations with partners. But the models are working and offer valuable case studies for bringing sustainable energy to scale in other places around the world.Now it may seem a little backward to have the smallest and most vulnerable communities taking the lead on an issue with such far-reaching consequences for the entire international community, but don't forget for many of us our very survival is at stake and we are determined to due what is necessary to ensure that the most vulnerable among us have a future.Finally, it is worth recalling that we are approaching the year anniversary of the day super-storm Sandy sent the ocean pouring into the streets and subways of this great city. Though SIDS may be uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we are merely on the frontlines of a crisis that sooner later will affect all of the world's citizens.Indeed, in a carbon-constrained world, where the economic growth of all countries is inextricably connected to creating sustainable energy solutions, it is no exaggeration to say that we inhabit the same island."}, {"title": "Harvesting Hope", "text": "What if happy meals resulted in happy kids and a happier, healthier world?

As the health of the South Bronx goes, so goes the health of NYC, NYS and the nation! Our replicable model helps to move us from a nation of red states and blue states to a united nation of green states, living eloquently and ecologically in line with nature -- one that is inclusive, equitable and transformational for all -- most importantly, locally grown and maintained. That 37 percent of local residents are food insecure and others are eating their way into chronic health problems is unacceptable. The potential to bridge gaps in culture, race and ethnicity rooted in the common denominator of food -- integrated with school and community -- seemed worthy of pursuit; especially since many of our students previously thought donuts were vegetables! That we can engage students -- in and across all academic areas -- rooted in health, wellness and feeding people -- while providing access to living wage employment and possibilities that help mitigate and impact environmental concerns globally is beyond anything we ever hoped for; yet, as our TED TALK shows, here we are.We don't expect every student to be a farmer, but we do expect them to read , write, do the science, the math, problem solve, speak to ordinal directions and processes, offer outstanding customer service, be engaged and aspire to things and places they've never imagined before. This is the promise of education that we are determined to deliver. When our video, URBAN FARMING NYC, filmed in a weekend as an extra-credit project, propelled us to the White House, peers and parents noticed. The whole Bronx cheered!

To think that we are routinely taking kids from the South Bronx and employing them across America, in high profile locations is simply spectacular!Innovation results from a state of mind. We're determined to foster situations and students to become active problem solvers, cooperators, collaborators and stewards with endless possibilities. When students and communities \"own\" their destiny, they truly shape and create it! Going forward, we need greater emphasis on career and technical education and the trades. We are a nation of do-ers; we are Amer-I-Cans! There is such a need for skilled labor, artisans, craftsmen of all sorts and at all levels! These are the jobs that will never be outsourced and will help grow our country. Moreover, they are skills that relate inherently to content area and information based texts. Institutionally, we're advocating for smaller class size and differentiated instruction. These issues speak to the need for personalization and humanization of the system and processes within. We'd like to see STEM expanded to STEAM with A representing ARTS, ASPIRATION and ADVOCACY; we need to come together creatively and collaboratively in shared space environments, the added value is tremendous and the sum far exceeds the total of the parts. Together, we can all prosper!Collectively, we owe our children opportunities and safe, healthy places where they can be inspired to perform and dream of a brighter future. Where we learn matters and we must start embracing the notion that healthy environments and classrooms can facilitate learning, performance, retention and aspiration.

(The rainy season's timing varies with latitude.) Scientists think that a longer dry season will stress trees, raising the risk of wildfires and forest dieback. The forest's annual fire season became longer as the dry season lengthened, according to the study, published today (Oct. 21) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"The length of the dry season in the southern Amazon is the most important climate condition controlling the rain forest,\" Rong Fu, a climate scientist at The University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences, said in a statement. \"If the dry season is too long, the rain forest will not survive.\"The new findings forecast a more parched future for the Amazon rain forest than the climate report released last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the study authors said. The IPCC models predict the Amazon dry season will last three to 10 days longer by 2100.But with the dry season already spanning an extra week each decade since 1979, the Texas team said the future effects will be more severe.During the 2005 and 2010 droughts, satellites detected decreased vegetation greenness over the southern Amazon rain forest (orange and red regions).\"The dry season over the southern Amazon is already marginal for maintaining rain forest,\" Fu said. \"At some point, if it becomes too long, the rain forest will reach a tipping point.\"Fu and her colleagues analyzed rainfall patterns across the Southern Amazon rain forest since 1979, and plugged the data into 50 simulations from eight climate models. The climate models from the IPCC's AR5 report, released in September, reported smaller dry season changes than actually measured since 1979. This means the IPCC models likely underestimate future predictions of rain forest climate change effects, the researchers conclude.Global warming can limit tropical rainfall across the southern Amazon in two ways, Fu explained. First, shifts in the southern jet stream can block cold fronts that trigger rainfall. (In the Northern Hemisphere, extremes in the northern jet stream pattern have been linked to wacky weather, such as the unusually warm winter in 2012.) Rising surface temperatures, attributed to global warming, also make it harder for storms to start. The heat inhibits \"convective energy,\" keeping warm, dry air near the surface from rising and mixing with cool, moist air above.Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.

The Homeland Security Council projects that a major attack would set off a deadly gas cloud that would kill 17,500 people, seriously injure 10,000 more people, and send 100,000 more people to the hospital.In 2006, Senator Barack Obama called these hazards \"stationary weapons of mass destruction spread all across the country.\" Senator Obama called for rules to require chemical companies to move to safer technologies where it's feasible to do so. So have many other leaders in Congress, as well as President Bush's EPA head Christine Todd Whitman and President Obama's former EPA head Lisa Jackson.Many companies, such as Clorox, have voluntarily switched to safer chemicals, demonstrating that it can be done. But hard-line chemical companies, led by the Koch brothers, have lobbied relentlessly in Washington to prevent reforms.I work with the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, a united group of environment, environmental justice, and labor organizations working for the changes we need. We just released a video highlighting the need for prompt action. Please watch and share with others. The video tells how to contact the White House and demand action.The more people see this video, the more they will be motivated to tell the EPA and President Obama to act. It shouldn't be a hard decision. A recent national poll showed that only 7 percent of likely voters oppose such a policy. And it's the right thing to do for our national security, for the safety of our people."}, {"title": "With United Nations Climate Change Agreement, U.S. Urges For Flexibility", "text": "By Nina Chestney and Valerie VolcoviciLONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The United States called on Tuesday for a more flexible approach to a new United Nations' climate deal which balances the needs of all countries and has a better chance of success.Two years ago, some 190 countries agreed to develop a pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol which would force all nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The deal is to be signed by 2015 and come into force in 2020.Countries will meet again next month to work on the content and design of the new deal in Warsaw but progress this year has been slow.Meanwhile, a scientific consensus that mankind is to blame for global warming has grown, putting pressure on governments - many of which have been focused on spurring weak economies rather than fighting climate change - to commit to ambitious emissions cuts.In a speech at a conference at Chatham House in London, U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern said for a new deal to be ambitious and fair it will require flexibility.\"A rigid approach is the enemy,\" he said.Rather than negotiated targets and timetables, countries should be allowed to determine their own levels of commitment depending on their circumstances and means, Stern said.This could be accompanied by a consultative period before the commitments are agreed to in which all countries and outside bodies can review them, and in which countries explain why their proposals are fair and adequate.In 2009, the United States outlined a path for steep cuts in its emissions of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and 42 percent by 2030 but it has not yet reaffirmed this.LESS RIGIDThe deal will stand a better chance of working if the rules which govern it are less rigid, Stern said.A very formal system based on rules for complying with targets and penalties for failing to meet them might sound good but would limit the ambition of many countries and their participation, he added.The legal nature of the agreement also needs to be flexible.Two years ago, countries did not specify precisely how a new deal would be legally binding, allowing for a \"protocol, another legal instrument, or an agreed outcome with legal force.\"Nations are in the early stages of discussing which elements of a new deal would be legally binding, but insisting that all aspects be internationally legally binding could be detrimental, Stern said.Critics say that too much flexibility could soften the new agreement, making countries less inclined to pledge strict emissions cuts and/or stick by them.\"If we are all ambitious, why shouldn't we put our commitments in a legal document that binds us all? Whatever countries pledge must have the same legal weight,\" said European Commission spokesman Isaac Valero-Ladron.The new agreement will replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which bound about 35 industrialised nations to cut their emissions until the end of 2012. Last year, the protocol was extended to 2020, after which the new pact will take over.Kyoto's effectiveness, however, was limited because it divided countries into rich and poor and developing nations such as China did not have binding emissions cut targets. The United States also never ratified the pact.It is \"unacceptable\" to use the same categories in a new deal to determine who is expected to do what, Stern said.China is now the world's biggest emitter and South Korea is now listed as one of the International Monetary Fund's 35 most advanced economies.\"Such a separation is inimical to ambition. It would also be viewed as deeply unfair by many countries, thus undermining the political cohesion we need to build an effective and durable climate system going forward,\" Stern said.

Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation\" - IPCC 2013The last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasised the impacts of global warming on the ocean. Scientists had previously warned us on sea level rise and explained its consequences for people - after all, most of us inhabit coastal areas. But in recent years, there has been growing evidence on other climate change processes affecting marine ecosystems: ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, and connections between the ocean and extreme weather events. Appropriate action is urgently needed.In February, at the launch of the Global Ocean Commission, I published an article in these pages entitled \"Managing the ocean to ensure our future\". Since then, the Commission has started work on translating scientific knowledge into concrete proposals for action to reverse ocean degradation. Without a doubt, we Global Ocean Commissioners share the urgency revealed by the IPCC report.Today, the Commission is publishing findings from an opinion survey carried out in 13 countries encompassing all continents and levels of development. Seventy-four percent of respondents consider it essential that an international organisation is charged with ensuring adequate protection in high seas waters - the waters beyond national jurisdiction that comprise two-thirds of the entire ocean. Only 12% said they were against progress in this global governance challenge. Surprisingly, the same study reveals that a majority of people believe that at least 25% of the high seas is already protected by some kind of legal instrument. The real figure is actually less than 1%. This shows a general belief that conservation tools applied on land (national parks, the Natura 2000 Network, biosphere reserves...) have been successfully transposed to the international ocean.Beyond national jurisdiction, the ocean is sadly seen as a free space. This leaves it open to various kinds of damage, and in some cases, illegal activities. This occurs because it seems far and invisible to all of us. Also, there is no integrated and holistic approach to ocean concerns.  The International Seabed Authority, which was established under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, designates areas of environmental interest, but only for the ocean floor. It means that the seabed is regulated separately from the water column, which does not reflect modern scientific understanding - it is as though there were no interconnection between different parts of the marine environment. Other institutions, for instance the International Maritime Organization, regulate specific activities. But they do it in a sectoral manner. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are expected to sustainably manage fish stocks; but their mandates are narrow and their records patchy. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has no power to protect high seas biodiversity. UNESCO can establish World Heritage Sites in the high seas, though it has not yet done so.It is therefore not surprising that high seas biodiversity protection is a patchwork of competencies and agencies, whose mandates and priorities are sometimes contradictory. The Global Ocean Commission promotes a holistic and integrated understanding of processes affecting the ocean, and aims to develop global and effective measures to address current challenges.The ecological balance in areas where food resources abound must also be maintained. The ocean provides food to a world population heading towards nine billion. If we do not conserve fish stocks in rapid decline, we will not eradicate hunger. Citizens of today and tomorrow have the right to access food. But the abyss between those suffering from hunger and those with excess of food keeps growing.During my term as Environment Minister, I launched the process of creating El Cachucho, the first marine protected area in Spain. This was part of the European Commission's Natura 2000 Network - the European network of protected areas, which now covers 27% of our territory.  El Cachucho is a large seamount located 65 km from the coast of Asturias on the Atlantic coast in Northern Spain. It rises from 5000 metres deep to peak just 425m below the sea surface. Its northern slope is one of the steepest in the world, and its rocky floor allows corals and sponges to grow. It is a rich, well developed habitat in which more than 600 species have been identified, including an extraordinary giant squid.El Cachucho is also an important nursery for commercially important fish including blue whiting, white hake, and monkfish. They are attracted by the presence of food and they benefit from marine currents spreading their larvae.The protection of El Cachucho has been made possible thanks to the wide range of stakeholders involved in the process - with, in some cases, divergent interests. The Spanish Oceanographic Institute together with other national and foreign experts brought their essential scientific knowledge. Environmental organisations such as WWF/Adena and Oceana initially proposed protection for El Cachucho in 2006. From then on, the Environment Ministry led the stakeholder process together with other Ministries and the Regional Government of Asturias. In 2007, Parliament successfully approved the Law on Natural Heritage and Biodiversity, which includes the definition of a Marine Protected Area.Still, the effort would not have succeeded without the very positive participation of local fishermens' groups. Their life experience coincided with scientific knowledge: protecting El Cachucho would allow the preservation of fish stocks, thus sustaining their economic activity.  Establishing protection measures in national waters can be a complex and lengthy process. In the case of El Cachucho, it took five years - the corresponding Decree dates from November 2011. But that looks simple when set alongside the process for creating protected areas in the high seas. And, still, for the high seas there isn't any organisation with overall responsibility of protecting biodiversity.According to my own experiences as Minister of Environment, I can affirm that the \"environment vs economy\" paradigm needs urgently to be dismantled. If we do not take into account ecological concerns, humanity will increasingly be confronted with natural resource depletion, extreme weather events and pollution. The economic cost is high.This week, I will be speaking at the International Marine Protected Areas Congress in Marseille, organised by the government of France and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It will be a perfect occasion for sharing successful experiences and identifying measures needed to improve current figures of ocean protection.A ministerial conference will follow immediately afterwards in Ajaccio. Governments from more than 130 countries will assess how far we stand from the ambitious target (agreed in 2010) of protecting 10% of the global ocean by 2020. At the current pace, we would need 100 years to achieve the target. I will be representing the Global Ocean Commission in both events. My central message will be that the public demands a better management of the ocean - and that governments, with food security and other issues in mind, must respond."}, {"title": "Ocean Acidification Has A New Enemy: Super Corals", "text": "In case you hadn\u2019t heard, CO2 levels are rising, the ocean is absorbing the CO2 and ocean waters are becoming more acidic.

Kuhio Beach in Waikiki and Sunset Beach on Oahu's North Shore are more than 40 miles apart, but the growing winter swells and extreme tides have caused rapidly shifting sands in both spots.At Kuhio beach, an old concrete wall along the shoreline resurfaced seemingly overnight. It poses a safety risk to tourists who walk, swim and learn to surf at the spot. The city of Honolulu trucked in sand to cover the concrete, but the solution was short-lived; after only one day, half the new sand had been swept away. Experts told the city that tidal bulge -- or higher than normal high tides -- was causing the rapid erosion, and the city has since decided to wait until the bulge is over to try replenishing efforts again.Since Waikiki was actually wetland until it was developed as a tourist destination, interfering with the beaches' natural patterns is nothing new, according University of Hawaii geology and geophysics professor Chip Fletcher. \"Waikiki Beach has not been in a natural state for nearly a century,\" he told Hawaii News Now. \"It's a heavily engineered and managed environment and as such it's appropriate to think of it as environmental infrastructure, just like our highway infrastructure.\"Over on Oahu's North Shore, the shifting sands are causing problems for several homeowners. As the northeast swells gain momentum and power, a handful of houses are seeing years of erosion in a matter of days.

Since then, 23,000 more new chemicals have been allowed to enter the market without rigorous testing. We may think that because something is on the shelves of our stores, it's been shown to be safe. We are mistaken. And what's all this got to do with air pollution? Many of these toxic chemicals \"off-gas\" -- they drift into the air in our homes and workplaces, and contaminate the dust on the floor where our babies crawl. We breathe them into our bodies.For years, hundreds of thousands of parents have been demanding reform -- just look at how some companies dropped the hormone disruptor BPA in plastics, for instance, because of consumers' protests. But the problem is that without regulation, manufacturers can just substitute BPA with another untested chemical that might be even more hazardous. We need strong chemical laws.

Federal agencies are now operating again after thousands of employees, deemed \"nonessential\" by Congress, were sent home without pay. While the turmoil of recent weeks has passed for the time being, the fact remains that some of these \"nonessential\" employees include those that provide vital services that safeguard our public health, national food economy, and keep at-risk citizens out of hunger. Facing the suspension of these services, the American public felt less safe about its food, farmers experienced greater economic anxiety, and furloughed employees faced an inability to reliably obtain something to eat. Together these issues underscore the fact that our existing food system, in which the majority of Americans have and expect dependable access to healthy food, can be easily disrupted by political insensibility. We must get our priorities straight and stabilize our food system in order to ensure that in the future we do not suffer the same consequences.During the shutdown, the diminished capacity of the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A) and the Center for Disease Control (C.D.C) caused Americans to distrust the quality of their food. A recent salmonella outbreak has garnered large media attention specifically because it occurred as employees were furloughed. The F.D.A sent home close to 45 percent of its staff while the C.D.C sent home 68 percent of its employees. The F.D.A inspects and regulates food processors to make sure that both the majority of domestic and imported food items are \"safe, wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled,\" ordering recalls if they believe it is in the public interest. The C.D.C advises state health agencies about how to effectively deal with outbreaks of foodborne illness, such as listeria and E.coli, by identifying the type of pathogen, notifying the public if there is an outbreak, and tracking the source. Without these organizations working at full capacity, the consequences are frightening because we expose ourselves to a new cluster of foodborne disease every two days. Additionally, the F.D.A collaborates with states and private industry to help protect the nation's food supply from terrorist threats as a matter of homeland security. The case is made that these agencies and their employees keep us safe every day and are very much \"essential.\"While the F.D.A and the C.D.C are focused on food safety and disease prevention, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A) supports the farmer who provides us with foodstuffs. As a result of the government shutdown, the U.S.D.A could not give farmers the typical assistance they require to stay economically competitive. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, a U.S D.A. production, was postponed during the shutdown and the delivery of that report has been canceled altogether. Traders and commodities brokers routinely use this document--which includes information on the world supply and demand of crops like corn and wheat--to set prices for these items. Without this knowledge and as a result of an irrational market place, farmers suffer because they cannot price their goods or plan production sensibly. Much is uncertain at the moment for farmers due to the effects of the government shutdown. We must give American farmers the information they need to thrive and economically succeed in order to maintain our national food supply.Many Americans were forced to recalculate their ability to purchase healthy food during the shutdown which highlights the need for food security. Most notably, the furloughed workers themselves were those most directly affected by a nonfunctioning government. Lacking a stable paycheck, many of these federal employees, numbering approximately 800,000 at the beginning of the shutdown period, had to fund their next meal without the usual support. While the government went back to work last week, the fact remains that approximately 47 million Americans live this experience each day and are dependent on food stamps to eat. As a 2009 stimulus boost for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal assistance program that funds food stamps, runs out on November 1, the difficulties for America's food insecure will increase. SNAP recipients will receive an average of $1.40 per meal, hardly enough to fund consistently healthy diets. The health of the country will deteriorate as a result and we are losing precious time to change this course.We need to look at these effects of the government shutdown and understand that our food system remains fragile. The work of the F.D.A, C.D.C. and U.S.D.A should not be considered secondary in importance through the eyes of the federal government. Each of these agencies keeps our country's food system intact in ways that many of us do not realize. Even more striking about the government shutdown is that without a functioning government, valuable time was lost to pass legislation to maintain the level of funding adequate to feed our nation's hungriest citizens. We cannot allow political squabbles to obstruct the actions necessary to help address our already pressing food issues. With the government currently funded through January 15, 2014, we must consider these employees and their services \"essential\" in the event that history repeats itself in a few months' time."}, {"title": "Tracking Earth's Limits in a World of Ecological Overshoot", "text": "How much productive land and sea area does it take to support your lifestyle?Most Americans might be surprised to discover that it would take the ecosystems of 1.9 United States to regenerate the ecological resources U.S. residents use annually. Were Italy's residents to use ecological resources produced solely within their country's borders at their current rate, they would need 4 Italys. Japan's residents demand the ecological resources of 7.1 Japans. It would take 1.8 Indias to support India. Egypt uses the ecological resources of 2.4 Egypts, and China the resources of 2.5 Chinas.These and scores of other \"ecological debtor\" countries use more of nature than exists within their own borders. They maintain their ecological deficits by depleting their own stocks of fish, trees, and other resources, and importing them from other countries -- all the while accumulating more and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans.Humanity has been outstripping the resources that Earth can renewably provide since the 1970s. We are in global ecological overshoot. According to Global Footprint Network's calculations, our annual demand for renewable resources and the services they provide is now equivalent to that of more than 1.5 Earths. The data shows us on track to require the resources of two planets well before mid-century.Climate change -- a result of greenhouse gases being emitted faster than they can be absorbed by forests and oceans -- is the most obvious and arguably pressing impact of ecological overspending. But there are others -- shrinking forests, biodiversity loss, fisheries collapse, food shortages, higher commodity prices and civil unrest, to name a few. Humanity is simply using more than what the planet can provide. As per capita resource demand grows while global population increases, we endanger the quality of our lives, particularly those in vulnerable economies where environmental health is the limiting factor for sustainable human development.There is still time to mitigate these resource risks. It's a question of making ecological limits central to decision making. But to create a one-planet future, we have to measure our impact on Earth.Global Footprint Network is an international think tank working to advance sustainability through the Ecological Footprint, the world's premier resource accounting tool that measures how much nature we have, and how much we demand.Conceived in 1990 by Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees, the Ecological Footprint quantifies every country's ecological resource demand (Ecological Footprint) against its supply (biocapacity). The demand calculation includes the land and sea area a population uses to consume resources, the ecosystems that absorb waste emissions, and the space used for buildings and roads. The supply calculation tracks how much biologically productive area is available to provide such ecological services.The Ecological Footprint helps governments, investors, corporations and opinion leaders manage their ecological capital -- both now and for the future -- and establish strategies to guide policies that advance sustainable development within Earth's ecological capacity. Global Footprint Network works to make resource accounting as commonplace as tracking GDP, employment, and debt:During Global Footprint Network's 10-year history, we've engaged with 57 national governments on six continents. Eleven governments have institutionalized the Ecological Footprint as an official metric. WWF International's biennial Living Planet Report highlights the Ecological Footprint of 150 nations. The United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report 2013 combines its Human Development Index (HDI) with the Ecological Footprint to measure the human well-being that countries generate. The Bertelsmann Foundation's Intergenerational Justice Index (IJI) integrates the Ecological Footprint with other indicators. The Ecological Footprint also serves as the denominator in the new economics foundation's (nef) Happy Planet Index calculation. And every year, more than a million people around the world use our individual Ecological Footprint calculator to measure their own Footprint.Global Footprint Network has received international recognition from the Blue Planet Prize, Zayed International Prize for Environment, and others.

Acting with good conscience to peacefully protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil drilling. They now face the absurd allegations of piracy, an offence that carries a maximum 15 year jail term -- a charge the Greenpeace International and international legal experts agree holds no merit in international and Russian law.But one by one, each of the detainees have been brought to the Regional Court of Murmansk in handcuffs, placed in a cage and had their appeals for bail dismissed. Their fate uncertain, the Arctic 30 have remained strong. Their courage, their plight, their calls for the Arctic to be protected continue to be heard from the courtroom.\"I want to show people all over the world that drilling in the Arctic is dangerous and could promote climate change ... my goal is to let people know about what has happened and could happen in the Arctic. I haven't committed any crime, I am not guilty of piracy,\" Finnish activist Sini Saarela said today.The request for provisional measures lodged by the Dutch government at the tribunal in Hamburg is based on international law, however, and should be seen as separate to the legal proceedings in Murmansk.The Netherlands lodged its request at the tribunal because the Arctic Sunrise is a Dutch flagged ship, making it akin to Dutch territory and affording the 'flag state' rights and duties under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).The Hamburg sea court has so far been infrequently used. Since it was established in 1996, it has heard just 21 cases. Only four of them have involved the issue of 'provisional measures'.Court hearings  The legal argument presented by the Netherlands will remain unknown until case documents become public, probably at the start of hearings. A likely argument is that the Russian Federation violated the right to freedom of navigation by boarding the vessel in Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (and clearly outside of Russia's territorial waters), in contravention of the UNCLOS.The Russian action, by boarding the Arctic Sunrise at gunpoint and towing it away was disproportionate and the Russian authorities should instead have notified the Dutch of any complaint, since the ship was not in their territorial waters.Any decision by the tribunal requires the parties to comply promptly with any provisional measures. The tribunal does allow, however, requests for the interpretation or revision of an order.Based on prior experience, a hearing on the Dutch request should now take place within two to three weeks and a judgment should be handed down two weeks later.As regards the fate of the Arctic 30, Greenpeace International therefore expects the tribunal to hand down its decision in about four weeks time.

Not a chance. But even if I could, I never would have understood why that might be a good idea, much less why our collective fate might depend on it.It's a different world today. At least if you're one of a group of dedicated and environmentally-savvy students called Team Marine at Santa Monica High School in southern California.Last month, after four years of work, they not only completed the conversion of a donated 1971 Volkswagen beetle from gas to all-electric, but when they turned it on, the car started up and it ran, as planned, just like the gas-powered car I had borrowed 42 years ago -- but without the air pollution.Under the direction of Santa Monica High School science teacher and team coach Benjamin Kay -- a one-man force for environmental education if ever there was one -- Team Marine received the donated VW in 2009 and then proceeded to raise money from a host of sponsors, acquire the parts, learn the technical knowledge required, and then convert the car by replacing its combustion engine and gas tank with an electric motor and 30-kilowatt hour lithium iron phosphate battery pack.And that isn't all. The team has also created an electric vehicle instruction manual, educational materials, and multi-media presentations that are designed to raise awareness about climate change, ocean acidification, energy conservation and carbon-reduction strategies. Over the next several months, the students will conduct local tests to showcase the VW's anticipated 100+ mile range, maximum freeway speed, and zero to 60 mph time.This is both an astonishing technical feat for a group of high school students and an extraordinary accomplishment in environmental education. But more than that, it is an act of environmental leadership from a generation of young students that, like it or not, are going to inherit the greatest environmental challenge the world has ever known -- and have to solve it.Climate change is a challenge of global proportions. But it is also an opportunity. In the words of the world-renowned whale scientist Dr. Roger Payne, \"[t]he environmental crises we face provide us with the most singular opportunity for greatness ever offered to any generation, in any civilization.\"If one measure of society's progress is environmental understanding and activism, the students of Team Marine are light-years ahead of where I was at their age. And that's very good news for all of us."}, {"title": "Fluffy The Penguin Gets The World's First Penguin MRI", "text": "We don't know how else to put it: you aren't ever likely to get a more charming look inside a penguin's brain than this.Fluffy is an African black-footed penguin who was having a hard time doing normal penguin things, like \"balancing, standing and waddling around,\" according to a media release put out by the University of Minnesota, which received the 18-year-old bird in late July.After conducting a battery of inconclusive tests, veterinarians decided to give Fluffy a brain scan -- the first penguin MRI that vet Micky Trent had ever come across. \"So this was a first,\" Trent says in this video -- which, happy spoiler, ends with the adorable Fluffy receiving antibiotics, regaining his balance, and going off to eat more fish with his buddy named BJ. In the middle, which is also exciting, you'll get to see an image of the penguin's brain:African black-footed penguins, also known as African penguins or jackass penguins (here's a video of them braying like donkeys), are classified as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. The population's sharp decline -- about 60.5 percent in 28 years, according to the IUCN -- is attributed to a reduction in the penguins' food supply due to commercial fishing.Earlier this year, the Minnesota Zoo hatched a baby African black-footer who's being raised by penguin foster parents, after its natural parents failed to incubate properly. You can find these animals at other zoos around the country -- the Maryland Zoo claims the largest captive population of black-footed penguins in North America -- on this delightful webcam, or in the wild on two dozen islands along the southern African coast.We asked U of M spokesperson Miranda Taylor where Fluffy lives when he's not undergoing medical treatment, in case readers wanted to visit, or to send flowers (or fish), but it turns out that the inside of Fluffy's head is more readily accessible than the rest of him.\"I'd love to share, but Fluffy's caretaker has expressed a preference to not be named,\" Taylor said. \"So sorry I can't be more helpful!\""}, {"title": "China Smog Photos Show How Bad Its Air Pollution Problem Has Become", "text": "China has a serious smog problem.

Native species are plants and animals present within a given area prior to European contact. Non-native (or exotic) plants or animals are defined as those species that were not present before European contact. The impact of urban landscaping on biodiversity may warrant altering conventional or \"exotic\" urban landscaping to emphasize native landscaping. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. Biodiversity includes species diversity, habitat diversity, and genetic diversity.Stokes Aster (Stokesia laevis), a flowering native plant that can be used in landscaping. Credit: UF/IFAS Photo: Tyler JonesThe conventional approach of landscaping with turf and ornamentals affects biodiversity in two ways: 1) it limits the diversity of native species in urban areas dominated by turf and ornamentals, and 2) it can affect surrounding natural environments, altering habitats in ways that exclude native plants and animals.Let's first look within the city limits. Simply put, landscapes dominated by turfgrass and non-native ornamental plants create an artificial environment that offers very little opportunity for most native species to thrive. A monoculture of turfgrass infused with non-native ornamentals excludes native plants and provides little to no habitat for most wildlife. However, biodiversity measures improve with the use of native plants. For example, more native plants serve as host plants for native butterfly larvae. Overall, the diversity of native plants improves urban biodiversity by simultaneously creating wildlife habitat and increasing the presence of native plants.Looking beyond the boundaries of cities, the use of turf and some ornamental plants can negatively affect biodiversity of surrounding habitat. Non-native species that invade and impact natural areas are called \"invasive exotics.\" Most invasive exotic plants in the United States were originally introduced as ornamentals in urban areas and then escaped and became established in surrounding natural areas. We are not saying that all non-native plants are necessarily bad, but today's non-listed exotic could become tomorrow's invasive species. Further, the maintenance of lawns and exotic plants with an array of insecticides, fertilizers, and herbicides can also affect biodiversity. With insecticides and herbicides, most people use these chemicals to keep other plants out and to keep turfgrass and ornamentals healthy and alive. The end result is usually the eradication of native plants and insects. For example, many insecticides are not specific to the pest insect and kill many of our native pollinators such as bees, beetles, wasps, and butterflies.The Precautionary Principle: Some will argue that evidence of impacts by exotics is not conclusive and exceptions occur. Further, they argue that if homeowners and the landscaping industry managed lawns and ornamentals appropriately, we could minimize our impact on natural environments. However, the risk is great, and thus the precautionary principle may be most appropriate here. Essentially the precautionary principle states that \"where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the absence of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.\" Maybe we should look at each ornamental plant as a \"risk\" and overall, reduce the number of non-native plants installed in our own yards.Certainly, non-natives do have their place (e.g., vegetable gardens, turfgrass for recreation, and exotic flowers for show), but the dominance of exotic vegetation is at the expense of our natural heritage. Alternatives do exist and people are increasingly interested in sustainable options.

Don't dry your clothes in a dryer: I always hang my clothes outside on a line in the wind, or you can use a rack if you live in a flat, in your bathroom or on your balcony. Towels are harsh, but I love it, it's like a loofah scrubbing effect!2. Wrap presents in newspapers: it looks artsy, funky, whimsical, thrifty, no matter, it looks different! Since I am a big newspaper buyer, I use first the comics, then the arts pages, the food section, travel news, then the front pages, unless they have depressing news on it.3. Recycle gift wrapping, ribbons and tags: Don't squeeze them in a ball in your hand after opening your presents, just flatten them and put them away for when you can re-use them. I have a special shoe box for those. On the same topic, stop buying Christmas/Hanukkah/Easter/Kwanzaa cards, just send FREE emails. Save the trees, save on stamps. A double winner.4. Never drive over 55 miles per hour: no joke! Do you know why the car builders have decided that the speed limit should be just that on interstates? Because that is the speed at which the gas usage is the most economical as far as the ratio speed/gas is concerned. Faster speed means higher gas consumption. And you thought the President of the United States had decided on that?5. Use beach sand for cat litter: OK, I know what you are going to say, yeah well, she lives in Florida, so that's easy for her to say! True, but you can buy construction sand at local builders' stores, for cheaper than cat litter at any store. Your cats will adore the feel of it under their paws; they know about the chemicals you're trying to make them use.6. Use baking soda for... everything, really: laundry detergent, scouring powder, fridge sanitizer, skin scrub, teeth whitener, and of course food recipes. Oh, and you can also add it to the sand box where your cat goes. Seven ways right there of avoiding harsh chemicals in your daily routines.7. Keep and wash the food receptacles: When you buy food at a deli, it comes in either a plastic box or a Styrofoam container, both ultra bad for the planet. But at least if you use them again, instead of splurging at the Tupperware Club, they can be put to \"good\" use. Plastic will recycle many times over, Styro will not, grrrrrr. Some battles cannot be won.8. Use your toaster oven: Instead of blasting full heat and full power into the stratosphere of your kitchen, think of re-heating food in the toaster oven. You can even cook a normal dish just like in the big oven, as long as the container fits, it will cook. And you will save energy and heat in your environment, which would crank up your AC.9. Rechargable batteries: That's a no-brainer. Why keep on buying and using harmful batteries when you can keep the same ones for years?

Japan's rapid response to find alternative energy solutions, including decisive government action, suggests how the U.S. could gain a foothold in a new segment of offshore wind -- floating turbines.Following the devastating earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear disaster in the spring of 2011, Japan decided to curtail its nuclear power industry and committed to diversifying its power supply through renewable energy technologies.Most recently, Japan invested heavily in deep water offshore wind floating technology demonstration projects. The country has seized the opportunity to move away from reliance on nuclear power and focus on building a nascent, but economically powerful industry. Whereas Europe has had the upper hand and decades of experience innovating and constructing \"fixed\" offshore wind turbines, floating turbine technology is still a competitive field where no single technology-type or manufacturer dominates or has a significant lead.And the market potential is huge -- deep offshore designs can unlock potential markets off the U.S. Pacific coast, Japan, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, and presents a global export opportunity. In fact, a 2011 U.S. Department of Energy report estimates that more than 2000 GW of offshore wind capacity are in deep water.To accelerate the growth of renewable energy development, Japan introduced a feed-in-tariff (FIT) in July of 2012, requiring utilities to purchase electricity from renewable sources at fixed prices. The generous FIT (23.1 Yen/kWh) has incentivized both land-based and offshore wind development and has also led to a growth in the domestic production of turbines.Domestic production is expected to expand in anticipation of the government's announcement that it will issue a separate FIT rate for offshore wind in the spring of 2014. And while there are no official targets for offshore wind deployment, offshore wind is on the political agenda and the budget set aside for the project is 18.8 billion Yen. It is estimated that 5-6 GW could be installed by 2030.The anticipated FIT and Japan's focus on domestic renewable energy deployment are driving innovation in offshore wind technology, primarily in deep water technology, which is where 80 percent of its offshore wind resource lies. With the government's support, several Japanese developers are constructing and deploying deep water offshore pilot projects. Several scale models and full-scale spar turbines have already been deployed.And in an interesting political twist of fate, a new public-private Fukushima Consortium -- Marubeni, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Japan Marine United, Statoil, University of Tokyo, and Hitachi, among others -- has plans to deploy three different prototype floating turbines off the Fukushima coast, right off the site of the nuclear failure. This project is largely government-funded to the tune of US$242 million.The first of the floating turbines to be deployed is a 2MW Hitachi turbine on a semi-submersible structure; two 7MW floating turbines shall follow. The goal is to ultimately reach full commercialization by 2018 with 1GW of offshore wind capacity.But it is not only project developers and component manufacturers who see the economic potential of offshore wind development. Investors such as the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recognize the promise of offshore wind and have established Japan Renewable Energy, which plans to invest as much as 50 billion Yen into clean energy projects in Japan over the next five years. Norwegian energy company Statoil, which is eager to build floating offshore pilot projects in international markets, has signed an agreement with Hitachi to use Statoil's Hywind technology off the coast of Japan.On the surface, Japan's offshore wind installation capacity and current project development look very similar to the offshore wind deployment in State of Maine. Despite each having a strong manufacturing base and university R&D centers, both lag far behind the offshore wind industry in Europe and have much to gain from Europe's decades of experience not only building offshore wind farms, but also in developing innovative technologies. Still, both are trying hard to catch the wind and recently set goals of achieving 5GW of offshore wind energy by 2030. It makes sense for these two political entities to focus on deep-water offshore wind -- the resource is greatest at these depths and both have workforces accustomed to employment at sea.But that's where the similarities end. Maine may have laudable goals, but they lack teeth. Japan on the other hand, has established a very strong FIT, and its offshore wind industry is expected to get even stronger in April 2014. The FIT legislation requires utilities to purchase the power produced by offshore wind farms. Contrast this to the situation in Maine, where local politics have led to the withdrawal of a major European power player, Statoil, which was to bring its floating turbine technology to a 12MW project off the coast of Boothbay Harbor.And while Japan and the U.S. talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, Japan is investing in and developing technologies at a much more rapid pace. Once its domestic power generation base is achieved, the Japanese government expects to export the floating turbine technology to markets across the globe. Some have ventured that the domestic production of turbine and turbine components can have an economic effect that rivals Japan's auto industry.European countries see the same potential -- at the national level, they also are investing in demonstration projects and research that will move the technology from the research stage to full commercial deployment. The U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) has also invested in offshore wind demonstration projects; in 2012, US$168 million was dedicated to funding seven offshore wind demonstration projects over six years; three of these are floating projects.Understandably, governments and politics vary across political borders. But the take home message is clear: public support in the form of clear and long-term policies is needed to draw developers, alleviate risk, and attract private investment.The development of floating offshore wind in Japan could signal a familiar pattern: The U.S. loses out once again to the next generation clean energy technology, while it dawdles away on policy confusion. And it could be this technology -- floating turbines -- where there is a real opportunity to develop industry authority against European manufacturers who dominate the pile and gravity foundation market.Other countries are taking offshore wind development far more seriously than the U.S. It's not too late, but the U.S. needs to up its game to see offshore wind as a scalable, commercial sector.The field is still wide open for the first mover in deep water technology. The U.S. has a scalable manufacturing sector, an experienced oil and gas sector (from where floating technology originates), significant federal R&D investment, and a large domestic market. U.S. DOE's investment in R&D is significant and critical for domestic innovation, but investment is also needed in launching commercial-scale projects.Japan is showing that a country can do both. The U.S. should follow its lead and become a real competitor on the world stage for offshore wind."}, {"title": "Lester Brown Reflects On His Remarkable Life As An Environmental Leader", "text": "There is perhaps no living environmental analyst and writer as prolific and widely known as Lester Brown. The founder of the Washington-based Earth Policy Institute, Brown has won numerous accolades, including a MacArthur Fellowship and a United Nations environmental prize. He will publish his 52nd book, an autobiography, on Monday.Brown was born in southern New Jersey, the son of farmers who had never finished elementary school. He grew tomatoes as a child, went to college at Rutgers University, and participated in an international exchange program with farmers in India shortly after graduation. Brown went on to work as an international analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service and later as the administrator of the USDA's International Agricultural Development Service. After leaving government service, he founded the World Watch Institute in 1974, and the Earth Policy Institute in 2001. His published works include the seminal Man, Land, and Food in 1963 and the Plan B series. His most recent book, Full Planet, Empty Plates: The New Geopolitics of Food Scarcity, was published in 2012.Now, at 79, Brown takes a look back at that life in his autobiography, Breaking New Ground. I've known Brown's family my entire life; I grew up on a farm in the same New Jersey county, and his sister and brother-in-law are active in the community there. I've had the pleasure of getting to know Brown as an adult, talking about environmental policy and also running Washington, D.C.'s Cherry Blossom 10-Mile Run with him a few years ago (\"with\" being a relative term, since Brown finished way ahead of me). We spoke in his office last week, Brown dressed in his characteristic blue, button-down Oxford, blue shorts, and blue New Balance sneakers.What made you decide to write an autobiography now? My first 51 books were about the world. I kind of narrowed the scope. For a long time I had trouble seeing how one would want to read about this. But then as I thought about it, I've actually had a rather interesting life in some ways and a variety of experiences.Some young people aspire to be writers. I never did. I just did not want to write, I didn't really enjoy it and I still don't. I don't actually write anything, I dictate everything. My speaking and writing styles are very similar. I enjoy communicating somewhat complex ideas in terms that people can understand, so I enjoy speaking and writing for that reason. If I had to choose between speaking and writing, I would speak. The problem is, if you want to reach large numbers of people on global issues you not only have to write, but you have to do books, because that's the only piece of the information sector where there's translation. Magazine articles occasionally get translated, but it's not systematic. So the reason there are 648 editions of my books now is because they are widely translated.How do you think growing up on a farm shaped your future path? It was a great advantage. What we don't appreciate is that it's an education unto itself. You're learning all the time. You see things, you do things, you're involved in things. And it is really a great education. When I look back at Rutgers, I took 24 science classes in 19 fields. It was just great. You learn a lot that we take for granted about crops. Farmers have to be systemic thinkers. They can't just think about plant pathology or soil physics or what have you -- they have to see the big picture. If you're a farmer, you have to think about all of these things, and you have to make decisions based on that. You don't know how big a tomato crop you're going to have, but you have to estimate the number of baskets you're going to need ahead of time.How have the issues you've focused on changed over time? In 1962, Silent Spring by Rachel Carson looked at the effect of pesticides on the environment and how it affected various life forms. She got that issue on the table rather dramatically. But then over time other issues have begun to emerge. Water became an issue, climate became an issue, and now we have a whole range of trends that are influencing the future prospects. A number of them are converging in this decade, which makes it a particularly interesting time.Another thing I realized in looking back is that I've lived during an 80-year period of remarkable change. If you could somehow chart the rate of change in the world from 10,000 years ago up until 1935, it was growing very gradually, and then suddenly it went way up. There's been more change during my lifetime than all history combined.In the book you talk about an agricultural exchange you did in India right after graduating college. Would you say that inspired you to look globally in your future work? Well, it certainly helped fuel that evolution in my thinking. But I'd always been sort of interested in the big picture. Neither mom nor dad had graduated from elementary school, so we didn't have discussions on world affairs over the dinner table. So I ended up doing a lot of reading and especially read biographies. All of those people had a major cause or issue they worked on -- whether it was Marie Curie or Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson -- and so I began to think of myself sort of in a leadership role. Not necessarily as a politician, but as an analyst of trying to see the big picture. That's what those people did, they worked on the important issues of their time. That's why we're reading their biographies today.You were one of the few people talking about population growth and the environment very early on. Those issues finally seem to be getting more attention these days. Do you think it has become easier to talk about? I talk about it all the time -- women's education, population, empowerment, etc. I think we're seeing a resurgence of interest in the issue. And it's been interesting that within the environmental community, the word \"population\" never came up, I think because they were afraid it might be politically sensitive. I did. For me, it's always been an issue. I did Man, Land, and Food in 1962, and that was about man, land, and food, so it was obviously incorporating population as a central issue. Looking back, I also think that I've been willing to take risks sometimes that others might be reluctant to take.Early in your career, you worked in government service. But you've spent most of your life working outside of government, but also not at one of the major environmental organizations. How do you think that affected what you were able to do or how it was received? It's probably given me a freedom that I would not have otherwise had. I guess if I were to describe myself, I'm sort of an analyst of world affairs with an environmental focus and an agricultural background. I'm interested in what's happening in the world, and in anticipating problems and figuring out what needs to be done. How do you deal with water shortages, or climate change, or population growth, or soil erosion, whatever it is?When I got a job in the Foreign Agricultural Service and had the rice bowl countries, I worked day and night to get to know world agriculture. I mean seven days a week. That set the stage for so many things that happened after that, whether it was writing Man, Land, and Food or anticipating the monsoon failure in India. I've always had a lot of confidence in my analyses on these issues and I think it's because I have a very broad base from which to reach conclusions. I'm not an economist, or an agronomist, or a plant pathologist. I'm looking at the big picture, always.Would you say that water access is the biggest immediate threat to human civilization going forward? Well, because it translates into food, and I think food is the weak link in the system. It's soil erosion, it's the loss of cropland \u2014 particularly in countries like China, where they're building factories, warehouses, roads and highways. China's losing a lot of cropland in a short period of time while their demand is going up at a record rate. They're moving up the food chain really fast. China's meat consumption now is about half of the U.S.' If they were to catch up to us, which they want to do--I mean, they're moving fast, it's just a matter of time\u2014it's going to take another 240 million tons of grain to get that additional meat. That's more than India produces, so that's not a trivial amount. And it comes at a time when, if you look at the world grain harvest grain-by-grain and country-by-country, you see that in many countries grain yields are plateauing.What do you hope people take away from reading your autobiography? One of the things that I don't say explicitly is that we're very fortunate to be born in this country, because there's an openness here that doesn't exist in any other society in the world. I mean, when you think about, if you look at the top 10 information technology companies in the world today, probably eight of them were started by teenage American males. It's amazing. Why didn't this happen in France, or Japan, both of which have better education systems than we do? I mean, the educational system is important, but there's this openness and this social mobility here. What it does is it permits a continual upwelling of talent. It doesn't make any difference where you were born or who your parents are or anything else. That, I think, is a reason for hope about the future of this society. We forget that it's self-renewing. We see all the problems \u2014 and there are plenty of them \u2014 but there is this upwelling that keeps things going.So, no plans to retire anytime soon? Why would one do that, when you're having so much fun? I mean, the reason I worked seven days a week is because it is so much fun. If I could find something that was more fun to do on weekends, I would do it. But except for the occasional long run on a Saturday or playing football when I could get a group of guys together, this is what I really enjoy doing.This interview has been edited for length and clarity."}, {"title": "Meet the Pit Bull That Learned to Trust Humans Again", "text": "You often hear negative stories about pit bulls. The press often focuses on attack stories and dog fighting rings, so understandably there are many people who don't trust pitties. This is the story of a pit bull that didn't trust humans. It took the tender loving care of a rescue, a loving volunteer and a new family to finally free her from her fear.Lora, a four-year-old stocky, brownish-blue pit bull, was left at the East Valley Animal Shelter in Los Angeles, Calif. in November of 2012. She had not been fixed, and had likely had a litter or two before being turned in. She didn't seem scared, just aloof. She was quiet, and hung out in the back of the kennel/pen, and her eyes were usually downcast. She clearly had a past. What that past was, nobody will truly ever know. When representatives from Best Friends Animal Society in Los Angeles saw Lora, they knew that she was going to be a challenge, but at least with the rescue, she had a chance at finding a home.When Lora arrived at Best Friends in January 2013, she immediately went into training, and received one-on-one attention with Layne Dicker, Best Friends volunteer and donor. According to Layne, she exhibited repetitive behaviors such as pacing and refusing to walk on a leash. She would \"pancake\" to the ground. Her handlers would have to resort to carrying her. Her refusal to walk was so intense the rescuers thought she might have an injury or medical condition. In truth, Lora was afraid and didn't seem to trust the rescue workers and volunteers, but they didn't give up.With just a few weeks of love, training and special attention, Lora blossomed. Who would have guessed that Lora, a dog that once hid in the back of the kennel and refused to make eye contact, was, in fact, the biggest lover of them all?\"She is a big, sloppy, love me pit bull,\" says Layne \"There is no aggression there.\"Lora's new favorite spot was on the couches at Best Friends, and her favorite thing to do was dole out kisses. It was also her only opportunity to be seen by the public. After seven months, and no potential adopters, Lora was transferred to the NKLA (No Kill Los Angeles) facility, a Best Friends initiative and sister facility.Majely Luquin, 28, who works in medical billing, went to the NKLA facility looking for a companion for her aging pit bull, Zoe. She thought a younger, smaller dog would be the ticket. Instead, she came across Lora and knew she was the one. As soon as Lora, now named Penny, and Zoe (who is 13) met, it was destined to be. The dogs, nearly identical to one another in breed, color, size and temperament, have a familial relationship. Now, the two dogs can't stop licking each other. Instead of fighting over the bed, the two dogs share it, often \"spooning\" one another. Penny still does \"pancake\" on the floor on occasion, but that's only because she doesn't want to leave her family's side.Visit the people who helped Lora (and many other animals) online: Best Friends Website, Best Friends Facebook, NKLA Website and NKLA Facebook, where you can see photos and profiles for other available animals of all sizes, ages and types in the Los Angeles area.Do you have a Tail of Hope or Survival?

The UN expects the global population to grow to somewhere between 8 and 10 billion by 2050 -- 1 to 3 billion more than it is today. The standard of living is expected to rise in many countries, and with it demand for more food, especially more meat.If you stray beyond these uncontroversial assumptions, however, things start to get dicey.Some say that genetically modified seeds are the answer; others say they\u2019ll kill us all. Some claim more fertilizer is the key to higher yields; others counter that only organic practices will produce sustainable output in the long term. Some assert there\u2019s still time to convince the rising middle class of east Asia to stick to their relatively low-meat diet; others say that the burghers of Beijing and Bangkok will inevitably eat more burgers as their incomes increase.The biggest question mark of all, though, concerns the impact of climate change. There's still plenty of disagreement on the topic, like over whether climate change will hurt or help global agricultural yield overall as precipitation patterns and ground concentrations of carbon dioxide shift. But many experts agree that a warmer climate will hurt some agricultural regions a lot more than others. Some of the countries that will be hit hardest are also those predicted to have the highest rates of population growth in the coming decades. Other nations expect changes to work to their advantage.The Google Scholar query \u201c\u2018climate change\u2019 agriculture\u201d turns up 80,100 academic papers published in the last 10 years alone. One of the leading researchers on the topic, David Lobell of Stanford, won a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d this year for his contributions to the literature.These researchers are working with the basic premises that higher levels of greenhouse gasses have already increased the global mean temperature by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and if nothing drastic changes soon, average temperatures will increase by another 3.5 degrees in the next few decades.A map showing the total amount of heat hitting various parts of the world. Many of the areas in white are currently too hot for serious agriculture, while many of those in black are currently too cold -- but climate change could shift the map in various directions.The jump could mean disaster for some of the areas with the fastest-growing populations.Rising ocean levels, for example, could flood low-lying farmlands in river deltas with salt water. This could cripple production of rice and wheat in the hugely productive deltas of the Ganges and Mekong Rivers of south and southeast Asia. Researchers have noted that the deltas currently feed hundreds of millions of people.And some productive regions could become too hot to sustain conventional crops. The fertile grasslands of Zimbabwe and South Africa, for example, might be forced by 2050 to forgo crops like wheat and corn, which feed millions. Rising temperatures may require less productive, but more heat-tolerant, crops like sorghum and millet.\u201cThe prognosis is really pretty bad for developing countries,\u201d said climate researcher Bruce Campbell, the director of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. \u201cThe temperatures in many of them are already on the outside of what\u2019s suitable for large-scale agriculture, so another 5-degree rise could be really awful.\u201dBut other areas don't see the news of climate change as all bad. Some places that are currently too cold to support significant agriculture, especially at high elevations and latitudes, could become more hospitable to the large-scale cultivation of staple crops like wheat and corn.So far, two of the most visible beneficiaries of these trends have been North Dakota, where farmers have had tremendous success planting wheat, and Greenland, where locals have been moving steadily toward agricultural self-sufficiency thanks to milder weather. Photos of lettuce and potato farms in Qatorqoq, near where Erik the Red discovered Greenland, are at once surreal, exciting and ominous.A farm in Qatorqoq, GreenlandGoing forward, one of the countries that stands to gain the most is Canada. Almost all the potentially arable land in the now-frigid taiga above the 60th parallel of North America is within its borders.Canada is already one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of wheat; about two-thirds of its overall production is shipped abroad. The country is also a leading producer of oilseed and barley. As the world warms, many think Canada will emerge as an even more crucial breadbasket. Some have even started to bet on it.In the past several years, Canadian investors have established several large farmland investment funds that have begun to buy up tens of thousands of acres of prime agricultural land in the heart of the Canadian prairie.While there are restrictions on foreign ownership of Canadian farmland, national investors have still expressed interest if the option were to become available. Two of the leading American investors in farmland, Shonda Warner at Chess Capital Partners and Jose Minaya of TIAA-CREF, said that they would love to invest in Canadian prairie farmland.\u201cSaskatechwan is extremely attractive,\u201d Minaya said. \u201cIf the restrictions on foreign ownership were lifted, we would move to acquire land there as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cIn a world that needs to double its food production by 2030 to 2050, there are very few countries in the world that are in a position to grow significantly their exports -- and Canada is one of those,\u201d said Tom Eisenhauer, the president of Bonnefield, Canada\u2019s biggest farmland investor.Eisenhauer said that parts of Canada have already experienced more favorable growing conditions thanks to climate change. Corn is now being grown in large swathes of Manitoba that were once thought to be amenable only to wheat. Farmers in New Brunswick have had more success than ever with potatoes. And the wine industry in British Columbia is anticipating the warmth already enjoyed by vintners in Oregon.Yet not everyone agrees that Canadian agriculture will fare well in the coming century -- or at least well enough to offset global crop losses expected due to climate change. One big problem is that the soil in much of Canada is less fertile than in places like the Iowa corn belt.\u201cActually, the soil in Iowa originally came from Canada,\u201d said Matt Roney of the Earth Policy Institute. \u201cDuring the last ice age, glaciers took all of Canada\u2019s best topsoil and dumped it on Iowa. So what\u2019s left up there isn\u2019t nearly as good.\u201dA farmer looks at his land in Manitoba during a drought. While some expect the area to significantly increase production as the climate warms, others, such as Barry Smit of the University of Guelph, think that droughts will happen more frequently thanks to climate change, lowering yields.University of Guelph climate scientist Barry Smit, who has been conducting research on climate change and Canadian agriculture for the past 30 years, used to believe the macro-scale models that predicted good things for Canadian farmers. But he said he's come to think that climate change will make droughts more frequent and severe across the prairie, making farming far riskier.Smit said that even if conditions become better for growing on average, it doesn\u2019t help farmers if variability increases at the same time -- because no single year will be an average year.\u201cFarmers don't deal with norms. The key things for them are when the conditions exceed their threshold for productivity, or when they\u2019re different from their expectations,\u201d Smit said. \u201cSo what we should really be focusing on isn\u2019t the average -- it\u2019s the events on the tails, such as droughts and floods, which look like they could become more frequent going forward.Even if Smit is wrong, and countries like Canada can ramp up production significantly, it will still be difficult to make the global food system more secure. Trade will only be a viable option for feeding people in areas hurt by climate change if those people can afford to import their food.\u201cA really poor country is not going to be able to afford to import in times of crisis,\u201d Campbell said.If hard-hit nations can't afford to buy from countries like Canada, the world's new farmland won\u2019t mean much to them, no matter how much it produces."}, {"title": "The World's Oceans Will Be Drastically Different By 2100 - Weather.com Science Behind Cimate: Oceans", "text": "By the end of this century, the world's oceans will undergo drastic changes that will have major impacts both on undersea life and on hundreds of millions of people who depend on them for their food and livelihoods, especially people in poor and developing countries.Read more on www.weather.com"}, {"title": "A Bright Future for Urban Farming", "text": "The last 10 years have witnessed a rapid growth of urban agricultural initiatives in many countries throughout the world (e.g., U.S., Korea, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Canada). Initially, the idea of producing food inside the city limits began as a response to a general consumer reaction to a wide variety of food-related issues, including GMOs, year-round availability of fresh produce without the food miles, food safety and food sovereignty. Early attempts to solve these issues were at best modest.City farms were, by necessity, small, often local projects that took advantage of vacant lots that were usually located in marginalized parts of the urban landscape. Crops were seasonal, grown in the traditional style of larger rural farms -- soil-based. In many instances, these were clandestine, and often times successful, operations. Their ultimate demise was to attract the attention of city councils and developers, who stepped in and re-re-developed these now more valuable properties back into office buildings, apartment complexes and such.A second wave of agricultural activities followed on the heels of these pioneering efforts. Large-scale rooftop gardens and greenhouses began springing up in unexpected places within the cityscape, and a whole new avenue of food production in cities began to show signs of life (i.e., profitability).This ultra-local food movement did not occur in the absence of \"growing pains.\" Gotham Greens, located in the industrial section of Brooklyn, took some two years to become legal. Its CEO, Jenn Nelkin, had to jump through many hoops (sometimes through the same hoop twice) before she got the \"green light\" from that borough to go ahead with her modest 2,000 square foot hydroponic facility. GG immediately began producing leafy greens at an astonishing rate, and outlet stores such as Whole Foods could not keep the shelves stocked fast enough with them to keep up with the demand. Today, Gotham Greens is poised to become the largest greenhouse facility in the greater New York area (perhaps on the entire East coast), having signed a long-term contract with Whole Foods to create a 60,000 square foot high tech greenhouse on top of its newest retail store now under construction in the Gowanus Canal district of Brooklyn. Profitability was GGs' sole concern, and profitability is what Nelkin and her associates have achieved.Another success story with a slightly different and much larger twist occurred in Bedford Park, Illinois. Farmed Here is owned and operated by Jolanda Hardej. Farmed Here renovated an abandoned three-story tall warehouse with an architectural footprint of some 150,000 square feet of growing space, making it the world's biggest vertical farm. In addition, Farmed Here makes a point of hiring newly-released non-violent offenders and trains them for work inside their facility. The facility has proven to be commercially viable, producing tilapia and a variety of leafy greens and value-added products from them (e.g., sweet basil vinaigrette) for a wide a variety of outlet grocers. Many other iterations of the vertical farm model are either up and running, or are on the drawing board awaiting funding and/or construction.The concept of raising fresh produce in the middle of a crowded city sounds far fetched to the uninitiated, but over the last few years, the realization of this \"far fetched\" idea has resonated well with those that live there to the point of creating a viable new industry around it. The future looks bright for city farming if the kind of initial progress noted so far continuers to accelerate."}, {"title": "Eight Mini-Stories of Family Farmers Nourishing the World -- And More", "text": "Co-authored by Delaney WorkmanAgriculture is responsible for approximately 70 percent of the world's fresh water use, 20-30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and 80 percent of global deforestation. But there doesn't have to be a trade-off between a healthy planet and full plates.Small-scale family farmers are feeding the world in ways that nurture local economies, social stability, and the Earth. These farmers have typically been using sustainable agriculture practices -- rainwater harvesting, intercropping, agroforestry, and other methods -- for generations.Smallholder farmers operate more than 80 percent of the world's agricultural holdings, and their farms usually measure less than two hectares. These farmers are nourishing their communities, protecting natural resources, increasing incomes and even breaking down gender barriers. To bring awareness to the crucial role that family farmers play in the global food system, the U.N. General Assembly has declared 2014 AS the International Year of Family Farming.With the support of research institutions, the funding and donor communities, and eaters all over the world, family farmers have the power to nourish both people and the planet.Each of these examples highlights that farmers aren't just farmers -- they are business women and men, innovators and teachers in their communities, entrepreneurs and stewards of natural resources.1. Increasing incomes -- In Indonesia, the Boyolali farmers' association, Asosiasi Petani Padi Organik Boyolali [APPOLI], supported approximately 2,000 of its farmers in getting their organic grower certifications. Using organic practices reduced production costs by 40 percent, and additionally, the market price of organic rice is 20 percent higher than non-organic or conventional rice. As a result, the region's organically certified rice farmers now enjoy an increased profit margin and greater incomes.2. Mitigating climate change -- Climate change and the natural disasters that come with it have had increasingly damaging effects on regions in sub-Saharan Africa, and have destroyed many farmers' livelihoods. In Tanzania, small-scale farmers in six agro-ecological regions have already recognized patterns in temperature changes that predict drought, and are responding with improved irrigation and planting short-season crops, drought-resistant crops and trees to mitigate the effects that extreme weather can have on their plots.3. Improving nutrition -- In Malawi, agro-ecological small-scale farming practices have improved child nutrition. A Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC) project studied, specifically, whether intercropping cash crops such as maize, soybeans, and peanuts with pigeon peas and other legumes -- a practice that protects soil health -- would help to alleviate malnutrition. The project also incorporated educational programs that provided families with information on nutrition, and the benefits of using legumes as a source of protein in children's diets. Communities that were involved with the project for long periods of time showed a significant increase in children's height and weight.4. Building social stability -- In Enayetpur, Bangladesh, a local NGO provided a group of low-income rural women with the technology to raise farmed fish in small ponds. Even in a heavily male-dominated Islamic society, these women were able to maintain control of the fish farms and the income that they produced, using it to build their savings and social status.5. Protecting valuable water resources -- In Benin, a women's agricultural cooperative implemented a solar drip irrigation system with the help of the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF). Not only did this technology allow them to use less water more efficiently, but with it, the cooperative's farm plots produced an average of 1.9 tons of produce per month.6. Saving seeds and preserving indigenous crops -- High in the Andes, small-scale farmers in Peru have undertaken a seed-saving project to protect over 1,000 native varieties of potato. In Parque de la Papa (Potato Park), indigenous farming communities grow their potatoes on mountain slope plots. They are collaborating with the Centro Internacional de la Papa (International Potato Center), a research institution in Lima, to preserve the seeds.7. Organizing for greater market power -- Women small-scale farmers and producers in a small town on the island of Lesvos, Greece established the Women's Agricultural Cooperative of P\u00e9tra to increase their power in the market -- and as a result, their incomes. After the demonstrated success of the cooperative, the Greek government established its national Women's Agricultural Cooperative Council only two years later. The P\u00e9tra cooperative now acts as a major agro-tourism site, where women sell traditional Greek foods, such as olive oils and pastas.8. Restoring soil health -- Due to poor farming practices, a large part of the Mexican region of La Mixteca, north of the city of Oaxaca, turned to desert. A group of Guatemalan refugee farmers who came to the region taught local farmers how to restore soil health and reforest the land using traditional, agro-ecological farming methods. These farmers organized and formed CEDICAM (Center for Integral Farmer Development), and have since planted more than four million trees on the formerly barren land.These stories highlight how farmers are finding ways to both nourish people and the planet. With more research and better investment in family farming, there will be even more stories to be told.Danielle Nierenberg is the co-founder and president of Food Tank: The Food Think Tank."}, {"title": "Meatless Monday -- Bite into Real Food For Food Day", "text": "The Congressional decision to cut SNAP dollars (formerly known as food stamps) starting November 1 makes Halloween especially scary this year.

KelleherCHICAGO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - When the Obama administration unveiled new emission regulations for coal-fired power plants earlier this year, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) blasted the proposed rules, saying they would hurt its members \"twice\" - as energy users and as polluters \"next in line\" for such rules.Last Tuesday, a NAM-supported effort to challenge the rules cleared an important hurdle when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case. The regulations, which critics call a \"war on coal,\" will cost industry \"tens of billions of dollars per year,\" according to the petition to the high court.But the proposed carbon caps, which come as the United States is on the brink of a potential power plant construction boom, could be a billion-dollar bonanza for the manufacturers that supply utilities and others with the pumps, boilers and turbines used to generate power.It's impossible to say with certainty how the rules will affect the finances of individual manufacturers. With some companies, such as Caterpillar Inc, gains from sales to utilities scrambling to meet the new regulations will likely be offset by reduced revenue from coal miners.But between now and 2040, the country will need to build 340,000 megawatts of generating capacity - or the equivalent of 15 of China's massive Three Gorges Dam - to meet growing demand from consumers and replace retiring plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).No matter what the Supreme Court decides, given the concerns about carbon and its link to climate-changing greenhouse gases, as well as the high cost, long lead times and unease associated with nuclear power, industry experts say the future belongs to natural gas-fired power plants. Those emit half the carbon dioxide as coal plants and can meet the new rules - if they're upheld - without much investment.The new rules \"make you look real hard at natural gas,\" says Jim Norvelle, a spokesman for Dominion Resources Inc, one of the nation's largest electricity generators.\"No. 1, you can build it quickly. No. 2, it involves the least amount of emissions of all the fossil byproducts. Certainly less than coal.\"Wind and solar farms, which emit no greenhouse gases, are expected to get a boost as well and will provide yet another possible windfall for manufacturers.Some of the winners in this new landscape are more obvious than others. Ann Duignan, an analyst with JP Morgan, says the shift away from coal will \"be a big plus\" for traditional gas turbine suppliers such as General Electric and Siemens .But the growing importance of wind and other renewables could provide a boost to some unexpected manufacturers, including Caterpillar Inc and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Corp. These companies, while not big players in the utility space, make small, gas-fired reciprocating engines - \"recips\" for short - ideally suited for the small, backup plants that will be needed to maintain grid reliability as the industry incorporates more renewables into its portfolio.The recips won't be the only solution utilities rely on - and technologies to store power using giant utility-scale batteries could ultimately make the backup plants unnecessary.But until that happens, utilities will use offline backup gas-fired plants to maintain reliability. And increasingly, recips, not traditional turbines, are the preferred solution.RENEWABLE BUT FICKLEWind has a lot going for it. It is renewable and clean and doesn't produce emissions linked to acid rain and greenhouse gases.But it is notoriously fickle - the industry prefers the word \"intermittent\".To deal with that volatility, utilities need offline backup plants that \"can come online and respond very quickly to fill in any gaps that the wind leaves,\" says Kent Saathoff, an official with Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which runs the grid that serves 23 million customers in that state. Texas is the No. 1 U.S. state in terms of installed wind power capacity, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association.For years, many utilities, including Luminant, the largest electricity producer in Texas, have relied on gas turbines - essentially small jet engines on a stand - to provide the backup power. But old-fashioned reciprocating engines from Caterpillar and Wartsilla - essentially big, natural gas-fueled versions of the internal combustion engine - are gaining favor, too.Recips offer considerable advantages over traditional gas turbines, according to some users, including Kyle Nelson, a senior vice president and chief operating officer at Mid-Kansas Electric Co LLC, a cooperative that provides power to 200,000 people in central and western Kansas.Both burn natural gas. Both create electric power. But turbines tend to be most efficient when they're making the most power. Reciprocating engines, on the other hand, are equally efficient at higher and lower loads.That flexibility is important. \"Typically, wind doesn't just all of a sudden quit. It kind of tails off,\" says Saathoffat the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.Recips are also cheaper than turbines and customers who order them don't have to endure the long lead times that come with turbines.Mid-Kansas is building a backup generating station - part of a growing array of such plants across the country's \"wind belt.\" When the 107-megawatt station becomes operational next May it will be used to provide fast, flexible back-up power.At the heart of the facility are 12 natural gas-fired piston engines built by MWM, a Mannheim, Germany-based arm of Caterpillar's electric power division.Similar plants, powered by similar engines built by Finland's W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, have been constructed elsewhere.\"We really like the reciprocating engine power model,\" Nelson says. \"They just look like sort of a Swiss Army knife - awfully handy from so many different angles.\"'MOVES THE NEEDLE'A project at a Delaware landfill shows another role recips could play in coming years as companies scramble to meet the EPA rules. It also shows how lowering a plant's carbon footprint can make it more, not less, competitive.The project captures methane coming off the Cherry Island dump to provide heat and power to industrial customers, using reciprocating engines built by Cummins Inc.Croda International Plc, which has a global goal of obtaining a quarter of its energy needs from non-fossil sources by 2015, is one customer.Its 140-acre facility located about three miles from the landfill, is Croda's largest in the world, according to Kevin Gallagher, Croda's president for North America.As a result of the project, the plant now gets 70 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources - and it hopes to raise that to 75 percent next year after a 770 kilowatt ground-based solar panel array is installed.To Gallagher, the landfill project makes sense from an economic as well as environmental standpoint.\"It's a good business project with a very attractive payback - somewhere around six or seven years,\" Gallagher says.\"It saves us about 20 percent on our natural gas energy bill. And because we're such a large plant, it helps us to move the needle significantly for Croda as it tries to meet its carbon reduction target. It doesn't bring us to our global goal in one fell swoop, but it's a very important part of getting there.\" (Editing by Ed Tobin, Christian Plumb and Ken Wills)"}, {"title": "Australian Wildfires Put Heat On Tony Abbott, Country's Anti-Climate Change Prime Minister", "text": "SYDNEY, Oct 21 (Reuters) - A long, hot summer looms for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott as devastating wildfires near Sydney fuel opposition to his plans to repeal a carbon emissions tax, one of his basic campaign pledges in the election he won a month ago.The links between the blazes and climate change caused by carbon emissions are complex and as the driest inhabited landmass on earth, deadly wildfires have been a perennial problem for Australia.But a series of record-busting hot, dry conditions across the continent and an early start to the Southern Hemisphere summer has rekindled arguments on mankind's impact on climate and what can be done to mitigate it.Abbott was elected in September on the back of plans to repeal Australia's scheme to price the carbon emissions responsible for global warming. He has promised to dissolve both the lower house and the Senate if his plan to scrap the scheme is blocked.But as the fires spread, the pressure is mounting on Abbott, who once described the science around climate change as \"absolute crap\".\"Reducing emissions is not a free lunch, but neither is climate change,\" said John Conner, the Chief Executive of independent research organisation The Climate Institute. \"If we're serious about reducing the risks of climate change and climate impacts like these bushfires, then we need to have a serious climate policy which is credible.\"More than 200 homes have been destroyed since last Thursday as scores of fires burned through thousands of hectares of bush, farms and rural communities outside Sydney. A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales (NSW) state, Australia's most populous.Forecasts for a return of hot, windy weather later this week has raised fears that three of the most dangerous blazes in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney could join up to form a massive \"mega-fire\", according to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.CARBON PRICING BATTLEThe previous Labor government's carbon pricing plan was aimed at reducing emissions by taxing major polluters with the world's highest carbon price of A$23 ($22.23) a tonne before moving to a market cap and trade system by mid-2014.Abbott, a volunteer NSW firefighter himself, now faces a tough test to convince opposition politicians to repeal it when parliament resumes next month, with the Greens and Labor vowing to fight changes.Abbott has a clear majority in the lower house, but if he fails to get the legislation through a hostile Senate, he has promised to call a double dissolution to break the deadlock. Such a move, last called in 1987, would mean elections to both the lower house and the upper house.After earlier rubbishing climate change, Abbott has subsequently acknowledged that it is happening and has proposed a \"direct action policy\" that would fund some projects that reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and punish businesses which exceed their \"business as usual\" emission baselines.But just days after taking over as prime minister on Sept 18, Abbott dismantled the Climate Commission and the Climate Change Authority, the two main government bodies for reporting the science of climate change and providing advice on carbon pricing and emissions reduction targets.Before being disbanded, the Climate Commission had reported that climate change had increased the incidence of bushfires in many regions, with heat waves more frequent and severe and the number of hot days in Australia doubling since the 1960s.Last month, leading global climate scientists said they were more certain that human activity was the main cause of global warming, which would bring more heatwaves and droughts, as well as more floods and rising sea-levels.Scientists and most politicians are loath to link single weather or fire events to climate change, and Australian Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt was heavily criticised by some government ministers and media for \"political point-scoring\" when he did that after last week's blazes.But the fires and persistent hot weather would increase public pressure on Abbott to come up with a strong alternative to carbon pricing, said Tristan Edis, a former research fellow at the Grattan Institute and now editor of Climate Spectator.\"It's not just about axing something. He's got to replace it with something that credible and in that respect, (the fires) help people that are concerned about climate change and want to see government action on it, it helps their cause to keep this top of mind.\" ($1 = 1.0348 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"}, {"title": "BP rests its case in Gulf spill trial's barrel-counting segment", "text": "(This article is published in \"The Louisiana Weekly\" in the Oct. 21, 2013 edition.)Phase Two of the Macondo spill trial ended Friday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans as BP rested its case in the barrel-counting or quantification segment. With Judge Carl Barbier presiding, BP and Anadarko called their witnesses last week after the U.S. Justice Department rested its case the previous week. According to BP's defense, 3.26 million barrels spewed into the Gulf after the Deepwater Horizon exploded in April 2010. The United States says it was 5 million barrels, including what was collected. Data presented in the quantification trial will determine how much BP is fined under the Clean Water Act.On Tuesday, petroleum engineering professor Curtis Whitson of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Trondheim, under questioning from Hariklia Karis for BP, said he and others built a model for the Macondo reservoir's fluids. Whitson said that his group also evaluated a model developed by thermodynamics expert Aaron Zick and saw serious flaws in it concerning shrinkage. Whitson calculated a shrinkage factor of 42 to 44, depending on how solubility was treated. That meant 42 to 44 barrels reached the ocean's surface for every 100 barrels that rose from the Macondo formation below. Liquid barrels at the surface are called stock-tank barrels. Justice Dept. witness Aaron Zick, who testified the week before, estimated more liquid reached the surface. BP maintains that less oil was left in the barrels that surfaced than the feds do.Questioned Tuesday by Mike Brock for BP and Anadarko, rock mechanics Professor Robert Zimmerman at Imperial College in London said he analyzed Macondo reservoir data, collected by Houston-based Weatherford Laboratories, to gauge pore-volume compressibility. He said the Macondo rock was weakly consolidated sandstone. \"My estimate of the average compressibility of the rocks in the reservoir was 6.35 microsips,\" Zimmerman said. The oil industry uses microsips as a measure of compressibility. The higher the microsips, the greater the amount of oil thought to be in a rock formation, meaning more of it could escape. For awhile during the spill, BP scientists recommended using 12 microsips for rock compression at the Macondo site. But BP's defense this fall has focused on a figure of around 6 microsips, suggesting less oil was in the reservoir.Petroleum engineering professor Alain Gringarten at Imperial College in London, queried Tuesday by Martin Boles for BP and Anadarko, said he evaluated total discharge from the Macondo well in two steps. He calculated permeability from pre-spill data at the reservoir level. Then he used his permeability calculations, along with pressure measured during the spill and the well's shut-in afterwards, to figure discharge. \"I found that the permeability of the reservoir is 238 millidarcies and that the cumulative discharge of oil is between 2.4 and 3 million stock-tank barrels,\" Gringarten said. Millidarcies are a permeability unit used by engineers. Gringarten also estimated that 810,000 barrels had been collected at the Macondo site.In the Phase Two trial, BP has relied on several expert witnesses from Imperial College in London, with which it has research ties.Reservoir engineering director Robert Clifford Merrill, Jr. at BP Exploration in Houston was questioned Wednesday by Martin Boles for BP. Merrill said his Macondo spill work included estimating pressures amid flow-rate uncertainty. In modeling with his team early in the spill, he used 6 microsips for the Macondo's rock compressibility. But in early July 2010, the team also experimented with 12 microsips in its calculations. After the well's July 15, 2010 shut-in, Merrill used 6 microsips for rock compressibility and said he supports that number now because it was the measured value.Multiphase flow expert Michael Zaldivar, president and founder of Evoleap, LLC in Houston, was queried Wednesday by Barry Fields for BP and Anadarko. Zaldivar said the well's sunken riser pipe in late April 2010 caused a \"slug flow,\" or alternating exodus of oil and gas from the Macondo reservoir from May 13 to 20, 2010. The riser pipe had a kink with holes in it. Based on riser-end-flow and kink-leak-flow modeling, Zaldivar calculated a well flow rate of 24,900 to 35,900 stock-tank barrels per day from May 13 to 20, with a best estimate for that period of 30,000 bpd.Professor Srdjan Nesic, director of Ohio University's Institute for Corrosion and Multiphase Technology, said Thursday he was asked by BP to examine how metal erosion affected the well's flow rate. Questioned by Mike Brock for BP and Anadarko, Nesic said for the April 22 to May 27, 2010 span, he considered \"geometries of interest\"--the blind sheer rams, casing sheer rams, the upper annular and a kink in the riser--in his computations. Those parts didn't erode at the same rate, and erosion in the various parts didn't have an equal impact on the flow rate, he said.\"I've concluded that this erosion of the elements of the blowout preventer and the kinked riser were so significant that if the BOP was the sole and the biggest restriction to flow, the flow would have doubled over this period of time that I've analyzed,\" Nesic said.Andreas Momber, research head at engineering company Muehlhan in Germany and an expert in cement erosion, was queried Thursday by Bridget O'Connor for BP and Anadarko. Cement in the well eroded slowly and may have hindered the oil flow for a substantial part of the spill, Momber said. He said it was scientifically unsound for U.S. Justice Dept. witnesses to have claimed that cement could have eroded in a little over 48 hours after the disaster, letting the oil flow.Mechanical engineer Adrian Johnson, manager at UK consultancy FEESA and a former BP employee, was questioned by Matt Regan for BP and Anadarko Thursday. He discussed difficulties in hydraulic modeling for the Macondo well. \"We have geometric changes, we have temperature changes, we potentially have flow-path characteristic changes, productivity index changes, pressure changes,\" Johnson said. \"So you need to do a rigorous model for each point in time that you're going to try and calculate a flow rate.\" The use of constant values for those factors in modeling by Justice Dept. witnesses made their flow estimates inaccurate and too high, he said.Under examination from Tom Benson for the United States, Johnson admitted that FEESA in July had billed BP $2.4 million for its Macondo analysis. Johnson also said he owns 13,000 shares of BP stock.On Friday, three witnesses for the U.S. Justice Department rebutted testimony by BP witnesses. Instead of making closing comments Friday, the parties involved will submit post-trial briefs. Judge Barbier said he hopes to announce due dates for those briefs Monday.Barbier heard the trial without a jury and must decide how many barrels spewed. He will decide if and when to hold proceedings for penalties under the Clean Water Act and other federal laws. And sometime ahead, damage claims by Louisiana, Alabama and other Gulf states are expected to be heard in U.S. District Court.Under the Clean Water Act, fines against BP could range from $1,100 per barrel spilled if simple negligence is found to as much as $4,300 a barrel if the company is considered grossly negligent. BP's CWA penalties could be as high as $18 billion. Eighty percent of those fines will be directed to economic and ecological restoration along the Gulf Coast. end"}, {"title": "War Against Nature Rages: Palm Oil, Tiger Annihilation, Rise of the Eco-Warriors", "text": "Almost three decades ago I began my formal training in forestry. I had a burning desire to know how trees and forests grew. I have fed that passion every single day since 1986.I am awed that for every one metric ton of old growth wood, trees have removed 1.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and concurrently released one metric ton of oxygen. Quite simply: Trees are the most perfect carbon dioxide warehouses to have ever evolved on Earth.Since February 2013 'The War Against Nature' and in particular the unscrupulous palm oil industry has been on a frenzied and unimaginable destructive rampage throughout the remaining Indonesian rainforests.The few remaining Asian rhinos, elephants, orangutans, tigers are doomed, but does anyone really feel their pain?A new report from Greenpeace details the swift clear-cutting of Earth's remaining SE Asian rainforests mostly from Indonesia. The pictures are enough to make a grown man cry.There's less than 400 Sumatran majestic tigers left on the globe and their days are quickly coming to an abrupt end. As every one of my students knows: In nature when you loose your home you die.In my short lifetime I have seen some awful ancient forest destruction - the most brutal and flagrant examples of 'timber mining' are now taking place on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo at an astounding rate. In fact within Indonesia alone, the prolonged, corrupt looting spree has reached almost 1.4 million acres of killing ancient rainforests annually since 2009.The Sumatran tiger is a vital marker of health within Indonesian jungles. When the tigers die, the forests die. And without forests the 69 million humans inhabiting Sumatra and Borneo will not survive.The Greenpeace report 'A License to Kill' found that \"Singapore-based Wilmar International Ltd, a palm oil behemoth, is engaging in irresponsible or illegal activities.\"Unregulated palm oil production not only wipes out exquisite rainforests and crucial peatland bogs that are the life-blood for Sumatran tigers, orangutans, rhinos and elephants, it razes Earth's only insurance policy (giant intact rainforests) from absorbing carbon dioxide from human-induced burning of 85 million metric tons daily of fossil fuels, which are irrefutably forcing climate change including creating tinder-dry conditions fueling hellacious fires in Indonesia, Australia and elsewhere around the globe.Earthlings are knowingly destroying the few remaining masterpieces of nature i.e. Asian tigers, rhinos, elephants, orangutans and others in the name of unsustainable palm oil plantations.The lowest forms of Earthling's, poachers, are illegally obliterating rainforests in the protected Tesso Nilo National Park to create these loathsome palm oil plantations. And worse, bribery and corruption runs rife amongst Indonesian government officials who regularly turn a blind eye and shirk any responsibility for protecting a national park whilst palm oil operators gleefully clear the forest, grab mature timber and sentence tigers to extinction, quickly.The Greenpeace report found that \"the following corporations including: Colgate Palmolive, Mondelez International (formerly Kraft), Neste Oil, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and others are linked to Wilmar International and its international trade in dirty palm oil.\"Wilmar is the world's largest palm oil processor accounting for over one third of global palm oil processing and distribution - a network covering 50 countries worth in excess of $13B, annually. And by the way, the U.S. commodity company Archer Daniels Midland owns 16 percent of the publicly traded shares of Wilmar. According to Greenpeace \"Wilmar has entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Kellogg's China, which means Kellogg's is also profiting from the killing of Earth's remaining SE Asian ancient rainforests.\"Amidst all this destruction a Dutch-born Earth-Warrior and forest ecologist extraordinaire Dr Willie Smits is a beacon of hope and force to reckon with for his actions to rescue, rehabilitate and release orangutans in Borneo's jungles.Smits and his fearless students replant the denuded forestlands with a wide array of nitrogen fixing native plants and trees including inoculating the soils with mycorrhizal fungus ensuring that plants and trees quickly and successfully recolonize the cutover lands.Smits has enlisted the services of school children around the globe in Deforest Action enabling children to monitor the Indonesian jungles with satellites and detect illegal logging - Smits is offering hope and fostering passion in our youth, globally.Smits is also the star of a brilliant soon-to-be released documentary 'The Rise of the Eco-Warriors.' He takes are group of passionate and adventurous young people into Borneo's jungles for 100 days as they courageously protect orangutans from rapacious palm oil companies.I give two thumbs up to this splendid well-produced thrilling documentary.Here's what you can do to make a difference:Scrutinize all products you purchase: Read their ingredients. Refuse to purchase products with palm oil.Support Deforest Action.Support Orangutan Project.Support The International Elephant Project.Support Greenpeace.Go and see 'The Rise of the Eco-Warriors.'If we all act together to say NO to the slaughtering of the remaining SE Asian rainforests our voice will be heard - loud and clear!Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and co-author of Life, The Wonder of It All."}, {"title": "In First Vote, Columbia College Students Back Fossil Fuel Divestment", "text": "73.7 percent of voting Columbia College students have backed a call for the university to divest from fossil fuel companies.The ballot initiative was included as part of an election for student body representatives that took place this week.

Argentine Scientists Tap Methane In Bovine Burps", "text": "By Maximiliano RizziBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by the bovine digestive system into fuel, an innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that cause global warming.Using a system of valves and pumps, the experimental technique developed by Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) channels the digestive gases from bovine stomach cavities through a tube and into a tank.The gases - which otherwise are commonly known as burps, or \"eruptos\" in Spanish - are then processed to separate methane from other gases such as carbon dioxide.Methane is the main component of natural gas, used to fuel everything from cars to power plants.\"Once you get it compressed, it's the same as having natural gas,\" said Guillermo Berra, head of INTA's animal physiology group.\"As an energy source it is not very practical at the moment, but if you look ahead to 2050, when fossil fuel reserves are going to be in trouble, it is an alternative,\" he told Reuters.Each head of cattle emits between 250 and 300 liters of pure methane a day, enough energy to keep a refrigerator running for 24 hours.Argentina is one of the world's top beef exporters, with around 51 million heads of cattle. Gases emitted from those animals account for 30 percent of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions, according to INTA, with methane having 23 times the global warming effect as carbon dioxide.\"This is also a way to mitigate that,\" Berra said.(Writing by Asher Levine and Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Leslie Adler)"}, {"title": "Bulldogs Being Bulldogs Compilation Is Exactly What You Want It To Be", "text": "Here is a compilation of not one, not two, not three, but thousands of bulldogs being adorable.Okay, maybe not thousands, but enough bulldogs to make today even better than it already is.Enjoy![H/T Tastefully Offensive]"}, {"title": "Huge GMO News", "text": "It hasn't been a good week for Monsanto and the rest of the biotech industry.Just three days ago, Mexico banned genetically engineered corn. Citing the risk of imminent harm to the environment, a Mexican judge ruled that, effective immediately, no genetically engineered corn can be planted in the country. This means that companies like Monsanto will no longer be allowed to plant or sell their corn within the country's borders.At the same time, the County Council for the island of Kauai passed a law that mandates farms to disclose pesticide use and the presence of genetically modified crops. The bill also requires a 500-foot buffer zone near medical facilities, schools and homes -- among other locations.And the big island of Hawaii County Council gave preliminary approval to a bill that prohibits open air cultivation, propagation, development or testing of genetically engineered crops or plants. The bill, which still needs further confirmation to become law, would also prohibit biotech companies from operating on the Big Island.But perhaps the biggest bombshell of all is now unfolding in Washington state. The mail-in ballot state's voters are already weighing in on Initiative 522, which would mandate the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Knowing full well that 93 percent of the American public supports GMO labeling, and that if one state passes it, many others are likely to follow, entrenched agribusiness interests are pulling out all the stops to try to squelch yet another state labeling effort.This time, however, things aren't going quite as planned. On Wednesday, Washington state Attorney General Bob Feguson filed a lawsuit against the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA). The GMA, a lobby for the junk food industry, has been by far the largest donor to efforts to defeat the labeling initiative. The lawsuit alleged that the GMA illegally collected and spent more than $7 million while shielding the identity of its contributors.The source of the money has now been exposed, and it turns out to be Pepsico, Coca-Cola, NestleUSA, General Mills and a few other junk food companies. The lawsuit revealed that GMA leadership held a series of secret meetings to plot how to perpetrate a money laundering scheme and illegally hide member donations from Washington state voters, in direct violation of campaign disclosure laws.Unlike the junk food companies that feared consumer backlash, Monsanto hasn't even bothered to hide the more than $4 million the company has given to the \"no\" campaign. In fact, GMA, Monsanto and a handful of other corporate donors have now broken a state record by pouring more than $17 million into their effort to stop Washington's GMO labeling ballot initiative.Voting is already underway in Washington, and the final ballots will be cast on November 5. The \"yes\" side is ahead in the most recent polls, but supporters of the right to know fear that a barrage of heavily funded and misleading ads could sour voters to the initiative.They remember that just last year, California's Proposition 37 was well ahead in the polls until Monsanto and its allies spent more than $46 million on their campaign in the Golden State.All this label fighting and money laundering leads to some very significant questions. Why are Monsanto and the junk food industry willing to spend many tens of millions of dollars every year trying to keep you in the dark about your food? What doesn't big food want you to know? And what are they afraid might happen if you did?Monsanto tells us that their products are about the best thing to come along since sliced bread. For years they've been promising that GMOs would reduce pesticide use, increase yields, reduce water consumption, and offer foods that are more tasty and more nutritious.I wish they were right.But in the 20 years since GMO crops first came on the market, studies have found that they have led to higher pesticide use, and no meaningful improvement in flavor, nutrition, yield or water requirements. Instead, what they've created are plants that are engineered to withstand massive dosing of toxic herbicides, and plants that function as living pesticide factories. Monsanto's Bt. corn, for example, is actually registered with the EPA as a pesticide.With concern about GMOs growing fast, and with the public being pummeled with vast amounts of misinformation, there is a tremendous need for clear, accurate and reliable information about GMOs. In response, the 100,000+ member Food Revolution Network and the Institute for Responsible Technology are co-sponsoring a free online GMO Mini-Summit. From October 25-27, some of the top GMO experts on the planet will be providing insights and clear calls to action in this teleseminar that is also being broadcast without charge on the Internet. Monsanto probably isn't too happy about the prospect of tens of thousands of people getting informed and mobilized. But if you love life, safe food, and the truth, then you might want to check it out.And if you want to lend a hand to getting out the vote in the state of Washington, you can sign up to volunteer here.Nobody knows what's going to happen in Washington between now and November 5.

When winter is six months of the year and feels like nine, you will do just about anything to beat the cold. One of these time-honored traditions is what I used to call the \u201cdefrost dash\u201d \u2014 a heroic run in one\u2019s haphazardly flung-on coat or bathrobe to the car parked out front in order to start the engine 10 minutes before actual departure.  Leaving the engine running and the heat and defrost blasting, one can enjoy the last few bites of breakfast knowing the car will be toasty warm and good to go when it\u2019s time to leave. Now, I admit that there were days when this extra engine running was a necessity and not doing so would have meant, at best, 15 agonizing minutes scraping ice from the windshield with numb fingers or, at worst, not being able to clear the windshield at all. Even then though, it bothered me. The view of the car just sitting there, the exhaust spewing light grayish fumes into the air, looked wasteful and dirty. I hadn\u2019t yet declared myself an \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d and the term \u201cclimate change\u201d hadn\u2019t been coined but I\u2019m pretty sure the sight of those neighborhood cars prompted one of my first, early utterances of the question, \u201cIsn\u2019t that bad for the environment?\u201d  It\u2019s only fair to admit here that I am far from perfect in my attempt at an eco-friendly lifestyle; the carbon footprint of a life involving frequent airline travel, Los Angeles traffic and air conditioning sadly still outweighs my \u201cgreen\u201d choices. That, however, doesn\u2019t mean the choices I do make are meaningless. Almost every leader of any great movement in history has probably at some point credited the baby steps, the individual choices we make, however small they may seem at the time, with creating the momentum that led to extraordinary change. And so I keep up with the \u201clittle things\u201d and try to continually add to the list: turning off the light when I leave a room, washing my clothes in short cycles of cold water, turning off the faucet while I brush my teeth, and a host of other habits that are proven to help preserve our environment. Which brings me back to those neighborhood cars.  I could have started this piece by just giving you the facts, telling you that leaving an engine running unnecessarily for only two minutes burns the gas equivalent of one mile of driving and in the U.S. alone costs Americans about $3.6 billion of their hard earned dollars; that this habit of ours is releasing a million pounds of climate-altering carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every second. I could have debunked myths like this one: Leaving the car running is better than turning off and restarting the engine. Incorrect! Fuel wise, starting a car is equal to only 10 seconds of letting it run so if the car\u2019s going to be motionless for more than 10 seconds, turn off the engine.  But I\u2019m a storyteller by trade and so that approach didn\u2019t appeal to me. I\u2019d rather paint an image (a cold winter day and a dirty exhaust pipe) and then give you a catchy name to go with it, like, \"Idling.\" Idling is how environmentalists refer to that nasty habit of leaving your engine running when the car is not in motion. Waiting for someone outside their house or workplace with the car on equals idling. Keeping the car running so you have heat or A/C while you text from your parking spot equals idling. Finishing emails in the parking lot with the engine going equals \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 idling.  Not only is this all too common habit of ours devastating to the environment, it\u2019s also so easy to change. Sometimes we get lucky and really bad problems come with really easy solutions: Turn off the engine while you\u2019re waiting for someone or using your cell phone. If it gets too hot, get out of the car. If it gets too cold, duck into a nearby building to warm up. Line at the valet or drive-thru really slow? Turn off the car and wait until you can actually drive forward an entire car length or two before turning it back on to pull up. With a little conscious effort we can end this damaging habit right now and take one more crucial baby step towards cleaner air and a healthier environment.  And for my friends up north still living through bad winters \u2014 turns out 30 seconds after you turn on the car, driving is the best way to warm up the engine. So, bundle up for a bit of cold and as soon as you can see out the windshield start driving to your destination, it\u2019ll only be cold for that first few minutes. You do that, and I\u2019ll continue not dropping my A/C below 76 degrees here in Los Angeles even on the hottest days, and believe me, they\u2019re only getting hotter.Rachelle Lefevre is an actress, Best Friends Animal Society spokesperson, member of the Environmental Media Association Young Hollywood Board and works closely with Environment California."}, {"title": "Long Island Pumpkin Snatcher On The Loose After Swiping 600 Gourds", "text": "Late last month, the sleepy Long Island hamlet of Calverton was shaken by a most audacious crime: At some point during the wee hours between Sept. 27 and 30, a pack of brazen thieves descended on Rottkamp\u2019s Fox Hollow Farm and made off with 600 pumpkins valued at about $4,200.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Jellyfish Stings An Increasing Public Health Concern, Experts Say", "text": "Small translucent blobs dotted the Waikiki shoreline when Angel Yanagihara set out for a sunrise swim one early July morning in 1997.\"An old woman on the beach told me, 'Don't go in.

Yet the ordeal, which culminated in \"three days of bedridden agony,\" redirected her research. She was determined to decode the mysterious sea creature's sting, and then find ways to protect other swimmers, fishermen and divers who might risk coming into contact with a potentially deadly jelly.That risk may be rising, according to some experts, who hold the popular but controversial opinion that factors including discharge of sewage and plastics, overfishing and climate change are creating ideal conditions for the hardy gelatinous animals to proliferate.

In fact, certain species of box jellies have been known to stop the heart of a healthy adult in less than three minutes.Yanagihara described the pain as the \"sensation of thousands of burning needles.\"She was fortunate to survive. An estimated 20 to 50 people annually are not so lucky in the Philippines, with the actual number likely to be far higher due to unreliable data, according to Gershwin.

The sting itself often goes unnoticed and rarely leaves a mark. But about a half-hour later, a constellation of symptoms may develop, including muscle cramps, vomiting and hypertension. In severe cases that end in heart attack or drowning, a jellyfish may never be suspected.The effects of jellyfish extend far beyond their sting, of course. Blooms have capsized fishing vessels, shut down nuclear reactors, clogged desalination plants, threatened an Olympic triathlon and devastated fisheries. Since the 1980s, according to the National Science Foundation, blooms of jellies have cost the world's fishing and tourism industries billions of dollars. Many fear the worst is yet to come.Jellyfish are more common than they used to be in many places, noted Mark Gibbons, a jellyfish expert at the University of Western Cape in South Africa. While we can't point a finger at any one culprit, he said, the \"coincidence is too great to be anything other than anthropogenic for most of those systems.\"Perhaps nowhere are box jellies more recognized than the coasts of northern Australia, which entered box jellyfish high season in October. Here, blooms of box jellies have long been an annual occurrence. But a 2012 study suggests rising sea surface temperatures mean an earlier arrival and later departure, and thus a longer season of danger for public health.Robert Condon, a marine biologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, led a separate study in 2012 that concluded the apparent rise in swarms of jellies may simply be an artifact of natural waxing and waning of global jellyfish populations on cycles of about 20 years. His teams's analysis of data since the 1970s did show a slight increase over time, he said, but more waxing than waning phases were also represented in that time period.The studies call for more monitoring in order to get a better grip on what to expect of the slimy creatures in the decades ahead.\"In a lot of respects, issues of blooms are kind of irrelevant,\" said Condon. \"We know we go through rise and fall periods, so we should prepare for that what's happening during future rise periods.\"Some South Korean scientists envision that preparation in the form of jelly-slaying robots. They are currently testing prototypes. But critics such as Condon warn that such a technology may actually have the potential to enhance a jellyfish bloom -- releasing the eggs and sperm and creating even more jellies. He recommends a thorough environmental impact study before any robots are set loose on the seas.Condon calls Yanagihara's new technology, meanwhile, \"really clever.\"Yanagihara has developed a dual-acting agent that blocks tentacles from shooting their toxic venom into the skin, while also providing treatment for stings -- just in case. The technology is the first that's designed for prevention, Yanagihara said, which is crucial in the case of fast-acting box jellyfish venom.\"It's been effective for every species we've tested so far,\" said Yanagihara.The concoction is currently in the pipeline for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. Yanagihara said she ultimately hopes to have various versions, including sunscreen-like lotions and IV therapeutics, available to the public and out on the beaches for lifeguards and emergency care-givers. U.S. Army Special Forces, fisheries and others have already expressed interest, she added.World-renowned long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad used the salve during her record-breaking open water swim from Cuba to Florida in September. She suffered box jellyfish stings three times during earlier, unsuccessful attempts at the crossing.Yanagihara, like other experts, emphasized the importance of basic research and surveillance to help predict when and where dangerous jellies may appear. She has a study coming out soon based on 16 years of data from Hawaii, which she said finds that while waxing and waning, the overall trend has been of an increase in jellies. And she has started field surveys of jellyfish in the Northern Mariana Islands and the Caribbean.\"Systems need to be in place to detect these things early,\" said Gibbons of the University of Western Cape. suggesting the benefits of someday being able to predict the pending presence of jellies based on, for example, wind patterns. \"But, at the moment, we're in a very poor position to be able to understand enough of the biology and the way jellyfish interact with the environment to build good models.\"Citizens can help by reporting any jellyfish stings or sitings at JellyWatch.org. Cell phone apps are available.

There's always trouble brewing. Last year I visited Rey Mayoral, principal at Novato High, to change my son's class and he asked if I'd help some of his students resurrect a garden that was started five years earlier by science teacher, Craig Kodros. I wasn't up for more volunteer gigs but then I met the keeper of the garden, Mary Buckley, who was a senior that year, and I was instantly smitten by her grace, intelligence and eco-enthusiasm. Together we started 'the new and improved garden club'; where a dozen students would meet at lunchtime once a week to plant, weed, sow seeds, spin compost, make bouquets of wildflowers or harvest organic greens and tomatoes for teachers and staff. Students could then earn community service hours (and score some extra credit points with teachers).The next school year, Mary graduated but in came her determined younger sister, Tori Buckley, to take over 'Garden Club.' She and new co-president of the garden club, Teya Neff instantly got us a Facebook page and a new, strong, highly motivated, mostly female garden crew. These students are my superheroes. Nothing deters them. Worms, spiders, muddy shoes, hard dirt? No problem. They even dug out an entire 5-year-old diseased tree, stump and all, and carried it high over their heads like a lumber crew, to the school dumpster, during their short lunch break.One afternoon, I mentioned that my dream was to paint the 72- foot gray garden wall so that in the winter, when there are few flowers blooming, the school garden still would look decent. \"C'mon, I'm the dirt diva. I need you peeps to make ME look good!\" I lamented. Luckily, Jensen Neff, a 10th grader at Marin School of the Arts at Novato High and a visionary member of the garden club was on the same page and stepped up to take charge.\"Ever since I was in sixth grade I've wanted to paint something that would add to the beauty of a school,\" she told me. Done and done! Goodbye boring wall! All we needed was someone to go to the principal's office to get approval. There was no way I was going back there... Instead, I sent the children. Neff and fellow art student, Gabi Borges spent the next week drawing a rough, colored sketch on paper to show him.\"After lots of worrying about if the mural project would be approved, I found that once you have an idea about how to add to the beauty of a place, it's very easy to convince people to let you get started, \"shared Neff. \"Fortunately, Principal Rey Mayoral was very supportive and the proposal to paint the wall was quickly approved.\" He simply asked to see a final drawing before painting began.Two dauntless women sprouted up to join the Sunflower Mural project: writer and garden teacher, Kirsten Neff and muralist and art teacher, Laurie Marshall, founder of www.unitythroughcreativity.net. The two began working out logistics and gathering supplies on not a shoestring budget but a baby earthworm budget, as well as supervising the students in sketching to proportion, graphing, chalking and choosing colors. More and more drafts were tweaked and refined by the students in order to gain Marshall's endorsement and get the green light to actually begin painting. Marshall has taught art and painted murals for over thirty years so she was a hard sell. This was a challenge. Especially for me because I have no patience... But, the girls persevered and by early summer they were outlining sunflowers, with chalk, across that long, boring grey wall.\"We choose Sunflowers for the mural theme because they are captivatingly beautiful, in all their different shapes, colors and sizes, \" said Jensen Neff. \"That's how we see students at Novato High. We think our school is a great place to be yourself, whether that \"self\" is artist, jock, nerd, cheerleader... or none of the above. Also, sunflowers are so powerful that they were used to help clean up radiation from the soil and water after the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl in Russia and Fukushima in Japan after the tsunami. We like that something so small (in the scheme of things) and unassuming can be so powerful and surprisingly able to solve some major problems. That is how we like to think of ourselves as students. We might surprise you with what we are capable of and what kinds of problems we might solve.\"Over the month of August, students (Tori Buckley, Annalise Dowd, Rubye Fangmeier, Tatum Figone, Sophia Grimani, Charlie Jones, Teya and Jensen Neff, Lexi Omholt, Evelyn Power, Sarah Sekulah and Vanessa Silva) showed up in shifts to paint. Even in the dry, August heat, there was always a student alongside Marshall, balancing a paint can on top of an 8-foot ladder, painting sky background, mountains and hillside or exquisite sunflowers. Watching Marshall's face as the mural progressed I got the feeling that if this were Laurie Marshall's world every wall of every school would have a gargantuan, vibrant mural-with-a-message stamped on it. \"Gardens and art give us hope: hope for growth, imagination, possibility, joy, fellowship,\" she told me one day (after she told me to be patient with the painting). \"We are celebrating the power of soil, sun, water, seeds and care.\"What was the biggest challenge of the sunflower mural project? \"The main challenge was at the beginning, \"Neff shared. \"I had to graph my original sketch so that it was proportional to the size of the 72-foot wall. Once the graphing was done on the paper, we used chalk and translated that to the wall. After that it was all relatively easy.\"Neff and fellow art students involved in the paint project hope that the Novato High organic garden and the new mural will show other students that it's possible for everyone to put a little color and beauty anywhere they choose, and that their efforts can make a difference. \"Sunflowers look like the sun and have traditionally been a symbol of light, power, warmth and optimism, all great things to wish for a high school garden and for young people in general,\" she said. \"Gardens and murals are similar to sunflowers. If you put some time into taking care of them, they give a whole lot back.\"Visit Annie at www.dirtdiva.comPhoto Courtesy of Kirsten Neff.(Article previously published in The Pacific Sun.

In a video from 2011, Willis explores Chernobyl's Number 5 reactor, eventually finding a \"hot spot\" he traces down to a tiny speck no larger than a grain of salt.After some rudimentary tests, Willis concludes the small particle is a fragment of spent nuclear fuel, likely ejected in 1986 when the Number 4 reactor exploded.In an email to The Huffington Post, Willis said that, despite its radioactivity, the particle didn't present an immediate health hazard, so long as he kept a distance from it. \"You would not want to eat or breathe this particle,\" he cautioned. \"Outside your body, it's a non-issue though.\"\"Most people don't get to fool around with spent nuclear fuel,\" he added.How well does this radioactivity represent the ongoing crisis at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi, the world's second-largest nuclear disaster? According to Willis, not all that well.Put simply, he says, \"the Fukushima accident happened in a very different way from Chernobyl. ... [Y]ou will not find chunks of fuel around Fukushima.\" Additionally, he notes, \"Understanding of Fukushima is still evolving. Indeed, the situation there itself is still evolving.\"WATCH the video, above."}, {"title": "How to Waste 40 Years", "text": "Forty years ago the Saudi Oil Ministry informed the U.S. Secretary of Defense that it would no longer supply fuel to the U.S. 6th fleet. The Arab oil embargo had begun. I had just begun as an environmentalist, and watched the nation struggle with how to deal with the news that our reliance on oil as the mainstay of our economy was no longer working.So it's sobering to watch the national leaders who had to cope with that first oil embargo -- and its successor oil crises like the Iran crisis of 1979 and the Gulf War -- draw their scary assessment of where we are:Admiral Dennis Blair: \"We shouldn't be lulled by our new oil production into thinking this is going to bail us out.\"Henry Kissinger: \"When I was in government I remember no concerns expressed by anyone about the environmental impact of oil consumption.\"Leon Panetta: \"We could have an America in renaissance. Or we could be in an America in decline, if we continue to fail to govern. That will determine if we make the right decisions about energy.\"And James Schlesinger: \"Since the 1970s no president deserves even a C+ on energy, because the public is not angry about energy and without public anger, things don't happen.\"These leaders -- and a dozen others from business to entrepreneurship -- have been gathered to ponder the meaning of the 40th anniversary of the embargo by Securing America's Future Energy, an organization single-mindedly focused on how to deal with the threat of energy insecurity produced by our reliance on oil.Schlesinger, I think, has it right. For a few years -- through the first embargo and then the Iranian crisis -- the country reacted. Not all of the ideas floated were good ones: Jimmy Carter's synthetic fuels program was a boondoggle. But the nation made for a time major progress in improving the efficiency of our vehicles, shifting off of oil for electricity, and cutting out some of our wasteful practices.Then the price of oil fell again, at Ronald Reagan's urging, we slipped into a national coma, one we didn't wake up from even when, in 2004 the price of oil began its startling run up to over $100 barrel.Today oil is twice as expensive as it was (in constant dollars) after the first embargo, we import a larger percentage of our total demand than in 1973, and we spend vastly more importing those barrels. We have plunged ourselves ever more deeply into a toxic military relationship with the Persian Gulf, and watch seemingly helplessly as the nations who profiteer selling us $100 oil use the proceeds to undercut our diplomacy and national security.Our national government has become a global laughing stock as we shutter the doors of basic governmental services, and a terrifying threat as we repeatedly lurch towards a possible default on the world's most important financial instrument, U.S. government debt -- the latest round of this brinksmanship closed out only a few hours after the OPEC+40 conference.This political crisis is allegedly driven by the inability of the two parties to agree on how to cut the deficit. Yet we seem oblivious to the fact that the decadal increase in the price of oil is responsible for $1.2 trillion of that debt, and that cutting the use of oil by 50 percent by 2040 would reduce our cumulative national debt by another $5 trillion. Why not stop exporting jobs and dollars to import oil which we then waste? Why not use our dollars to build our own economy instead of Russia's?Forty years ago the U.S. tried everything -- but its options were not very good. Today, with oil over $100, we are swimming in options: improving vehicle economy and performance, shifting from air and road to rail and ship, enabling ourselves to get around without getting in a car, and fuel diversification -- electricity, biofuels, natural gas -- all replace oil at a cost a lot less than $100 barrel. The key missing ingredient is competition and choice in the transportation sector -- not technology or economics. We have allowed a foreign oil production cartel to be sustained by a domestic transportation fuel distribution and infrastructure monopoly.Indeed, by far the most positive voices at the conference are from companies like GM and Royal Caribbean, talking about the enormous progress they have made in alternative fuels and efficiency -- and the business opportunities they have uncovered. GM's CEO Dan Akerson says, somewhat boastfully, \"Our new Chevrolet Spark Electric Vehicle can accelerate 0 to 60 miles per hour as quickly as the iconic '67 Camaro SS. And it's possible to drive 1,000 miles or more between fill-ups in a Chevrolet Volt or the all-new Cadillac ELR, if you do most of your driving in pure electric mode.\"And as Akerson acknowledges, this is also about posterity and climate.Oil combustion is responsible for more than a third of the climate crisis which accelerates every day. Wasting oil is the part of the climate crisis getting the least attention. The president has articulated -- even with difficult political realities -- a strong set of strategies to reduce our combustion of coal. In this he is joining the environmental community which has developed and is implementing an increasingly effective and increasingly global clean electricity strategy.But neither the president nor the environmental community has developed a similar strategy to ending our waste of oil and crackdown on its monopoly, even though that waste and monopoly are not only an environmental catastrophe but also an economic and security nightmare. The fuel economy standards which Obama put in place as part of his strategy to rescue the U.S. auto makers were an enormous first step -- and they worked. Why then did we seemingly stop, as if the job was done?When California adopted tough fuel efficiency rules to bring the auto industry to the negotiating table, other states rushed to join it. But California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, written by a Republican government, has yet to find partners and allies.Perhaps the source of our lassitude is 40 years of effective propaganda by the oil industry, telling us that only if we \"drill baby drill\" can we curb our dependence. Perhaps it is the fact that just when we get ready to react in the face of $5 gasoline, the price of oil tanks the global economy and briefly falls back to earth.Perhaps we simply need to get angry, and demand some leadership.My headline was misleading. We didn't waste the first five years after the embargo, as Schlesinger reminded us. But surely 35 years is still too long to nap.A veteran leader in the environmental movement, Carl Pope spent the last 18 years of his career at the Sierra Club as CEO and chairman.

The granted issue is \"whether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\" This question is one that the court hasn't grappled with before. (They never touched this in Massachusetts v. EPA.)  The six petitions were consolidated for one hour of oral argument, which is not likely to occur until 2014. The Court denied review of three other petitions challenging EPA on greenhouse gas rules.  This narrow review granted allows the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as a pollutant to stand, even as it agreed to examine how the agency could demand greater pollution controls through the permitting process.The interpretation of the acceptance by the Court from the National Association of Manufacturers was, \"Manufacturers are pleased with the Supreme Court's decision to review the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations from stationary sources -- one of the most costly, complex and harmful regulatory issues facing manufacturers and threatening our global competitiveness.\"Gina McCarthy, the EPA Administrator, said in a statement that the court was taking up a \"very narrow legal question\" that would not substantially weaken the Obama administration's climate-change agenda.In June 2013, as part of his Climate Action Plan, President Obama directed EPA to issue a new proposal by Sept. 20, 2013 to reduce CO2 emissions from new power plants. The president also directed EPA to propose federal guidelines by June 1, 2014 to be used in conjunction with state programs to reduce CO2 emissions from existing power plants.In keeping with that directive, the EPA issued their New Source Performance Standard rule-making in late September outlining maximum emissions for new power plants. The basis for their issuance of the rule-making was the earlier Supreme Court ruling in 2007 in Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that EPA must regulate greenhouse gases as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.   When you look, not only at the power generation to which the first set of CO2 regulation applies, but also at who else are the top emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, next in line is the oil and gas industry because of methane emissions, the manufacturing sector leading off with iron and steel, the concrete industry, as well as the agriculture sectors. Very few folks get left out except renewable electricity producers like wind. So everyone has skin in this game.So where does that leave industry and the EPA? The Supreme Court had the opportunity here to revisit Massachusetts v. EPA. Many of the petitioners asked the court explicitly to revisit that case in light of how far they had seen EPA push PSD and Title V permitting and questioned again whether EPA really has this authority. The court declined that invitation.  But, industry does get to have the court revisit at least part of the greenhouse gas authority that the EPA is exercising. This could slow down the EPA in some areas if they provide additional guidance here. Right now EPA will forge ahead, now that the government is funded again, with its listening tours and outreach to the states and industry. Some leaders in Congress will try to slow them down as well. The timelines announced in the president's directives are tight and would conclude most of the rule-makings before the end of his term."}, {"title": "Back in Business?", "text": "Yesterday, many could say the nation went back to business.

We are excited and relieved to have all of America's 401 national parks open again.

Dozens of the Foundation's Ticket to Ride field trips were canceled, preventing more than 6,000 students from experiencing hands-on learning in America's living classrooms. About half of the Foundation's America's Best Idea programs were forced to cancel scheduled activities, and parks like San Antonio Missions National Historical Park had to cancel programs that would have welcomed 500 youth to the park. Likewise, many scheduled volunteer trail maintenance days and healthy living focused programs made possible by the Foundation's Active Trails grants had to be canceled. We are currently working with parks, schools and community organizations to reschedule and restore what was canceled or postponed. And these are just a sampling of the park programs that were negatively impacted by the shutdown.If anything, this moment has reminded us all of how important the parks are to each and every one of us. More than ever, we stand in solidarity with the men and women of the National Park Service, the local Friends Groups, and the park businesses and concessioners, and thank them all for their dedication and perseverance. Closing the parks was counterintuitive to everything our national park community represents and no one wanted to turn people away. For all that our national park community does and provides, they deserve better than what was handed to them over the last 16 days.With time, things will likely return to normal, but will we really ever be back in business? I fear for many of those in the parks community that there is a long road ahead to find that answer. Park visitors, both domestic and international, may think twice before planning their next national park trip because they may worry about being turned away due to an unexpected shutdown. That uncertainty may be costly.However, we stand united to help, working with the National Park Service employees, local Friends Groups, concessioners, partners, volunteers, visitors and others to shape the next century for our national parks together. That first step starts today when you go visit a national park. Go now! Enjoy all they have to offer. When you are there, thank the National Park Service employees who work so hard to preserve these places, meet the local volunteers and supporters that give of their time and resources to help protect them, and visit the local business owners that help shape your experience.

Due to our antiquated federal laws on toxic chemicals, many of the products in our homes contain chemicals that have been linked to serious health effects like: infertility, early puberty, cancer and hormone disruption.In response to this growing body of science, many people are asking different questions about the products they buy and use. Individuals and organizations have been urging retailers to play a role in solving this toxic riddle.We are celebrating a victory because Target announced an impressive first step to address toxic chemicals in the supply chain.Photo credit: FanofRetail (Creative Commons)Summary of Target's \"Sustainable Products Standard\"The standard works primarily as an incentive program for the manufacturers who sell in their store. Target will systematically rank their manufacturers on how they are doing in regards to chemicals, based on the criteria below. The manufacturers will be given a score, which will be used by Target's buyers (the people who decide what to sell in their store) and will help guide their purchasing decisions.The ranking of products will be based on the following criteria:We are pleased to see that half of the score for the product ranking focuses on the ingredients used. We carefully developed a road map for retailers (called the Hazardous 100+ list) based on the leading authoritative lists on toxic chemicals. We are encouraged to see a strong overlap between the Target \"red list\" of chemicals to avoid and our Hazardous 100+ list.While we recognize that taking action on toxic chemicals from the retailer's perspective is not an easy task, we find a few areas for improvement for Target's Sustainable Products Standard.A few areas for improvement:All in all, we think this is an important first step for Target in moving the market towards safer products. We applaud Target for creating this standard and look forward to working with them overtime to hone and expand this standard.For those of you who have been asking questions, signing petitions and calling manufacturers, it's working.

Contaminated drinking water remains a critical public health problem in large swaths of Africa. Unsafe drinking water contributes to 88 percent of cases of diarrhea worldwide. Diarrheal disease is the second leading contributor to global disease burden and kills more than 2 million children a year.  \u201cThe statistics are staggering,\u201d says Jared Schoepf, co-founder of SafeSIPP and a Ph.D. student in chemical engineering at the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering at ASU. \u201cMore than 3,000 children die each day in developing countries because they don\u2019t have access to clean, safe-to-consume water.\u201d (In the photo at right is the SafeSIPP team from left, Lindsay Fleming, Schoepf and Taylor Barker.)  And that isn\u2019t the only cost, Schoepf says.  Women and children have to haul buckets and jerry cans of water balanced atop their heads, often walking a mile or more. When a girl gets old enough to carry 40 pounds of water, \u201cshe will spend her time collecting water every day, instead of where her time should be spent \u2014 in school.\u201d  People in Africa spend 40 billion hours every year walking for water, according to the group Charity:Water.  The SafeSIPP, which stands for \"sustainable innovative portable purification,\" is designed to solve both problems. A handle on a heavy-duty plastic barrel allows a person to easily transport 30 gallons of water, cutting the amount of time spent hauling water by 75 percent. More importantly, a patent-pending filtration system cleans the water as it\u2019s rolled back home.  \u201cThe water is safe to drink,\u201d Schoepf says.  The top-secret element in the technology \u2014 until the patent is approved, anyway \u2014 is filtering the water on the cheap. Water filtration systems used for backpacking, for example, can cost $80 to $100.  \u201cWe found cost-effective ways to purify the water,\u201d Schoepf says.  SafeSIPP and the nonprofit My Arms Wide Open are expected to conduct a pilot program in South Africa this fall. SafeSIPP will begin sales to development groups in January 2014.  SafeSIPP is a top five finalist in the College Entrepreneur of the Year competition run by Entrepreneur Magazine.

While the devil may be in the details, and concessions were made on both sides, the importance of knowing that our country can meet its debt obligations and keep the government running cannot be overstated.While it's not surprising that most Americans opposed the government shutdown, what is encouraging is that most Americans recognized the government shutdown's grim impact of blocking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from doing its job. According to a new PPP Poll commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council released today, two-thirds of Americans say they opposed the near shutdown of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and they wanted the EPA back on the job protecting our health and the environment.Many on the far right have chosen to ignore the fact that most Americans recognize EPA as a guardian for our environment and health. When asked how they felt about the shutdown forcing EPA inspectors off the job, suspending cleanup of toxic dumps, and delaying work on climate change, a large majority of Americans opposed this work being stopped. And this is true nationally, among Latinos, in key states, in districts represented by once-moderate House Republicans who have changed their positions to support the Tea Party's agenda -- and even in House Speaker John Boehner's home district.The PPP survey demonstrates just how out of touch lawmakers are with their constituents. As taxpayers, we are all counting on the government to do its job by funding the key agencies that protect us from poor air quality, ensures our families have clean water to drink, and healthy communities.This survey also echoed findings of previous polls again highlighting how deeply Latinos care about the environment. Though often viewed as single issue voters, this survey again disproves this assertion finding that 73 percent of Latinos nationwide recognize just how critical the EPA's work is and oppose a shutdown that prevents EPA employees from doing their jobs -- support higher than that of non-Latino respondents. Latinos also continue to be very supportive of taking action to stop the carbon pollution that causes climate change with 68 percent of Latinos opposing a shutdown that interferes with taking action steps to reduce air pollution and control climate change.Latinos are counting on the government to do its job and more than 72 percent oppose the rhetoric from extreme right voices calling to keep EPA closed. Those in the extreme factions of the GOP should take note: The president's net-approval rating is 27 points stronger among Latinos than the country as a whole. Latinos want the government to protect our environment and 71 percent of their Latino constituents say they would have a less favorable view about elected officials who say it's a good thing to eliminate the critical work that EPA does in protecting our health and fighting climate change.As NRDC President, Frances Beinecke stated, \"People who care about health and the environment must be vigilant in the coming months. We have to let lawmakers know how much we value government programs that safeguard the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the places we love.\" This poll demonstrates that Americans are ready to stand up for the agency that does just that: We want our EPA."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Supreme Court Will Hear Challenges to EPA Rule", "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court opted Tuesday to hear challenges raised by states and industry groups to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rules issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act. Six of nine petitions were granted review. The specific issue in the case deals with the GHG permitting program that the EPA implemented in January 2011 (commonly referred to as the Tailoring Rule).Since 2011, the Tailoring Rule has required new power plants and other large polluting facilities to apply for permits to emit greenhouse gases. According to the Oct. 15 order, the Supreme Court will consider whether regulating GHG emissions from vehicles necessarily triggers a requirement for stationary industrial sources such as power plants to obtain permits for their GHG emissions. The court will look at \"whether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.\"The court will not consider other issues such as whether greenhouse gases endanger public health when it hears arguments early next year. It is expected to issue a ruling by the end of June 2014.A 2007 Supreme Court case--Massachusetts v. EPA--found that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act. That ruling prompted the EPA to promulgate the first-ever GHG regulations for motor vehicles.The Supreme Court's review of these regulations could slow the EPA's work on a rule to account for carbon dioxide from burning wood for energy, according to ClimateWire (subscription).\"The EPA is dealing with two issues that related to our industry right now,\" said Biomass Power Association President Bob Cleaves. \"One is how to respond to the D.C. Circuit ruling in July that invalidated the Tailoring Rule deferral [of biogenic emissions], and secondly, how to measure carbon emission from biogenic sources. Our reading is that the court appears to be prepared to examine the statutory underpinnings of EPA's authority to regulate power plants, including biomass, and we'll continue to work with EPA on the underlying accounting rule for biomass to get the science right on the issue.\"Deal Reached to End Government Shutdown, Raise Debt CeilingA bipartisan deal to raise the debt limit through Feb. 7 and fund the government through Jan. 15--ending a 16-day partial government shutdown--was reached Wednesday. President Barack Obama signed the bill Thursday morning.House Republicans had pushed to block new EPA regulations on greenhouse gas production and to roll back regulations on coal ash, among other things. The deal, however, is not rumored to include provisions related to energy policy or for repaying states for funding national parks during the shutdown (subscription).The shutdown will have wide-reaching environmental impacts--reducing the nation's ability to react to extreme weather events and carry out research. Antarctica field researchers who have spent decades collecting data on penguins and ice sheets to better study global warming now have documentation gaps. Further delays in a decision to approve or disapprove the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry tar sands from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, are expected after the shutdown made it harder for the State Department to review the permitting process.Airline Carbon Tax Proposal RevisitedThe European Commission this week issued a proposal that would impose a tax on air-polluting emissions for all flights operating in Europe's airspace. The proposal follows a controversial plan the European Union (EU) had to back down from last year. That plan would have required flights crossing EU airspace to buy pollution credits to cover 15 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions for the entire journey.The proposal still has to be approved by the European Union's government and parliament. If it passes, the legislation would apply from Jan. 1, 2014, until 2020, when an international airline carbon emissions tax scheme, agreed on by the International Civil Aviation Organization's assembly of nations from the U.S. to Russia and the EU, takes effect.\"The European Union has reduced greenhouse gas emissions considerably, and all the economic sectors are contributing to these efforts,\" said EU Climate Change Commissioner Connie Hedegaard. \"The aviation sector also has to contribute, as aviation emissions are increasing fast--doubling since 1990. I am confident that the European Parliament and the Council will move swiftly and approve this proposal without delay. With this proposal, Europe is taking the responsibility to reduce emissions within its own airspace until the global measure begins.\"  The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

The immediate crisis may be over, but the negative effects if the shutdown will continue to impact fisheries management and ocean conservation for weeks, or even years to come.   While some fishermen were stuck on shore waiting for government permits, like the Alaskan King Crab fishermen of the popular Deadliest Catch TV series, the majority of the fishing industry kept fishing, removing 30 million pounds of seafood from the ocean on average each day.   The problem is that during the government shutdown, the scientists, observers and others who survey fish abundance and ocean conditions, help recover threatened marine mammals and sea turtles, and work to ensure that the ocean is healthy enough to support our fishing industry were metaphorically (and in some cases literally) left high-and-dry on shore.   This is because most of the U.S. Fisheries Service was furloughed during the shutdown -- according to news reports only 500 of the roughly 3,000 staff at NOAA fisheries were at work during the shutdown. Those out of work included the personnel at the Fisheries Science Centers, halting work done to support fisheries from coast to coast, including updating critical fish stock assessments.   These assessments inform how much fish should be caught in the coming year. The shutdown created gaps in new data, which could result in a roll-over of last year's fishing quotas, even though this could be completely inaccurate for next year. That is a big risk, especially for the fish populations that are in decline.   The shutdown also affected important work at other agencies charged with protecting and managing ocean resources. For example, regulators at the Department of the Interior were likely unable to gather or synthesize important information and which could jeopardize implementation of needed protections, like promised new safety and operating rules for oil companies in the Arctic Ocean.Meanwhile, NOAA's research boats were literally tied to the dock when they should have been on the water counting fish and collecting data. Already, some ocean studies were ended prematurely when the shutdown occurred. NOAA has only begun thinking about the impacts of ocean acidification and climate change on our ocean resources. (And, by the way, the last time the ocean started to become this acidic was 300 million years ago and was associated with mass-extinction of most species on the planet).   Here in the U.S. we have some of the world's healthiest fisheries, largely because our fishery management system successfully incorporates science into its decisions. We need Congress to learn that shutting down the government and keeping fisheries scientists and other employees out of work is immeasurably damaging to scientific research and conservation. These scientists ensure that U.S. fisheries move towards sustainability and remain a viable source of food and jobs for our country for generations to come."}, {"title": "Five Reasons to Join Us Tomorrow for the Global Frackdown", "text": "This Saturday, thousands of people around the world will take action to ban fracking in their communities as part of Global Frackdown 2, the second international day of action to ban fracking. More than 200 actions will be taking place in more than 20 countries spanning six continents, all calling for a ban on fracking. From Australia to India, France to Argentina, South Africa to Canada, and all across the United States, people will be taking action in their communities -- demanding that their elected representatives protect their communities and our planet from fracking and associated activities and work to move towards a clean energy future. Will you join us?There are many reasons to join the Global Frackdown, but here are our top five reasons to join the actions on October 19:1. Mounting scientific evidence shows that drilling and fracking causes water pollution.  Every month, we see new evidence of the damage that drilling and fracking does to our essential water resources. Just this month, a peer reviewed study out of Duke University found elevated levels of radioactivity, salts and metals in river water and sediments at a site where wastewater from oil and gas operations was treated and discharged into a creek in western Pennsylvania. The researchers warned that this inadequate treatment could leave a long-term legacy of radioactivity in our waterways.This comes just a few months after whistleblowers within the regional Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) office in Pennsylvania released a presentation to the Los Angeles Times that indicated EPA scientists believed that gas drilling and fracking was likely involved in the contamination of drinking water in Dimock, Pa. This follows similar evidence -- ignored by the EPA -- in Parker County, Texas and Pavilion, Wyo. Pressure is mounting on the EPA and Obama administration to reopen those investigations and this will be a major focus of Power Shift and some Global Frackdown actions.2. Climate change is real and fracking causes climate change.  Drilling and fracking for oil and gas is contributing to global warming. In addition to the carbon dioxide released from burning natural gas and oil, the potent greenhouse gas methane leaks from drilling and fracking operations. Just last month, a new report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated unequivocally that methane is significantly worse for the climate than stated in its 2005 report. This report gives us even greater cause for concern about the rapid expansion of drilling and fracking for gas and its ability to contribute to climate change.Building out the network of pipelines and infrastructure necessary to expand the use of fracked gas in the United States and export it overseas will lock in decades of dependence on dirty fossil fuels at a time when climate scientists are unequivocally stating we must keep fossil fuels in the ground. On October 19, we need to unite to call for a stop to this madness and a dedicated transition to a renewable energy system.3. The oil and gas industry will be paying attention. Last year, the oil and gas industry commissioned a white paper called, \"The Global Anti-Fracking Movement: What it Wants, How it Operates and What's Next,\" conducted by a risk management firm to give the industry advice on how to respond to the effective movement to stop fracking, citing the Global Frackdown as one of many events that fostered global networking and collaboration for a ban. The report mentioned \"outright bans constitute the most significant political risk to the industry.\" This year's Global Frackdown is even more powerful with over 340 partner organizations and even stronger and more powerful actions.Oil and gas industry, take notice -- our movement is growing and won't be stopped.4. Polls show Americans increasingly oppose fracking and we must not stop now. The more people learn the truth about fracking, the more they oppose it. A national Pew Policy Center Poll released in September found that 49 percent of Americans oppose the increased use of fracking, while only 44 percent support it. The opposition grew by 11 percentage points just since March of this year, when only 38 percent of Americans opposed increased fracking. State polls in New York, California and Pennsylvania follow this trend. Organizing in communities across the United States and big mobilizations like the Global Frackdown are making a difference -- people are ready for real renewable energy solutions and do not want to saddle their communities and the planet with the dangers of fracking.   5. When we organize, we can win. From six communities banning fracking in Argentina to moratoria on fracking in Netherlands and the Czech Republic, to continuing to keep New York free from fracking, to passing local measures against fracking in 395 communities across the United States, communities are fighting back... and we're winning.Just last week, the highest court in France upheld the French Parliament's national ban on fracking and the European Union voted to approve requiring in-depth environmental audits before allowing drilling and fracking in shale in the European Union. The industry is strongly opposed to the bill.This summer, more than one million petitions were delivered to the Obama Administration asking them to protect federal lands from drilling and fracking, with over 650,000 calling for a ban. This large outpouring of support for a ban shows how far our movement has come and puts us in a tremendous position to ramp up pressure on the administration to reverse its pro-fracking agenda.So this Saturday, join the growing movement to ban fracking! Find an event near you and encourage your friends and family to join you. We must act now to protect our planet for future generations."}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - October 17, 2013", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport FACEBOOK: Green News Report The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: The long national shutdown is over -- for now -- and environmental services and protections are returning; PLUS: Australia erupts in 'freakishly early' bushfire season; AND: The 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo ...

Three of those mothers died of cancer while their children -- my friends -- were still in elementary school. I remember going to my first funeral for a friend's mom when I was in first grade.Since that time, my mother, sister, brother and brother-in-law and a long list of friends -- have now also died of cancer. Those losses are terribly painful for me. I miss them all every day.Over time my sadness turned to anger and outrage.The incidence of cancer was on the rise -- and there was nothing in sight but virtual Band-Aids.I wished more than anything that there was a treatment that would allow my loved ones to walk away from this dreaded disease.Science has been steadily chipping away at the problem for more than 100 years. Today, cancer treatment has become a big business. Corporations market and package treatments and cures into something that often resembles a spa more than a hospital.Cancer treatments are a distant reality from a spa day for those who must endure them to stay alive.There are many reasons cancer has become ingrained in the landscape of our lives.The National Institutes of Health first reported in 2008 that each year, more than one million Americans -- and more than 10 million people worldwide -- will receive a cancer diagnosis. But the vast majority of those cancers are preventable.Only 5 to 10 percent of all cancer cases are caused by genetic defects; the rest have their roots in the environment and lifestyle.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that each year globally, 12.7 million people learn they have cancer, and 7.6 million people die from the disease.We have fought a good fight.Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, known to many as the \"War on Cancer\" -- in 1971, and since that time billions have been spent and cancer treatment has progressed -- but still the diagnoses continue to rise.Preventing cancer is not easy either. Just as there isn't one magic bullet to fix disease, nor is there one to prevent it.But I often wonder why we don't wage a war on the causes of cancer.Cancer prevention should be on the top of every corporate spreadsheet.How would that change the way we do business? What could that do to expand corporate social responsibility?In the U.S., chemicals are introduced to market with scant understanding of their consequences to human health. It takes a health crisis to prompt regulations. Of course by then, the damage is already done. The cancer comes, the mothers get sick and more young children go to funerals.Do we really think it's a good idea that there are more than 80,000 chemicals currently registered in the United States that we have little understanding of relative to human health and the environment?We live in a world where outcomes for human health and the environment clearly have taken a backseat to profit.I began my crusade against the environmental and lifestyle causes of cancer because I have lost too many people whom I loved.The odds are you have endured similar losses.Until we decide this in unacceptable, nothing will change."}, {"title": "Let's Prevent This Crisis: A Letter to Harvard's President Faust", "text": "Dear President Faust,As a fellow leader of a large institution, I sympathize with your concerns around fossil fuel divestment. But I must disagree with your conclusion that divestment is not warranted or wise. Just as you have a duty to look out for Harvard's academic mission, the City of Seattle must look out for our employees, who rely on our pension system for a secure retirement. We also share a greater and overlapping responsibility -- one to our planet and to future generations.The moral dimension of climate change, as well as its financial implications, require us to find solutions that make divestment feasible. Over time fossil fuel investments will prove to be highly risky and, ultimately, continued investment in this sector will have strong negative impacts for investors as well as society. You argue that engagement with fossil fuel companies will yield greater benefits than divestment. These companies, with their corrosive influence on politics, funding of climate-deniers, and abhorrent human rights records, will \"engage\" on climate change, while continuing to extract fossil fuels that we cannot burn if we wish to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Their valuation is based almost entirely on their carbon reserves -- reserves that must remain untapped for the sake of our climate and our future. It's wrong to wreck the planet, and it's wrong to profit from the business model that is driving that wreckage.We have the opportunity to map out a strategy for divesting from fossil fuels in a phased manner that protects our financial interests and meets our moral obligation to future generations to stop the devastation of climate change. I am hosting the Seattle Divestment Forum this month, on Oct. 17-18, to help local governments and large institutions begin to develop financial tools that allow us to divest from fossil fuels without putting our pensions and other investments at risk. I invite you to join us for this conversation.With the largest academic endowment in the world, one that rivals the size of the economies of many countries, Harvard is uniquely positioned to lead on this issue. And yes, this would mean using the endowment as an instrument of political and social change. Harvard has done this before. In 1990 when Harvard divested from the tobacco industry, Derek Bok, then president of the University, said in his letter that Harvard's decision to divest ''was motivated by a desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged in significant sales of products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.'' Surely causing what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls \"unprecedented changes throughout the climate system\" creates a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to human beings.Divestment is not only about addressing the actions of fossil fuel companies, particularly in the near term. It's about stating that it's unacceptable to have your whole business model and financial value be predicated on the extraction of resources that are detrimental to human life and the planet. It's about refusing to be part of the problem, and hopefully finding investments that are part of the solution. It's also about significantly reducing risk to those who rely on these investments.The City of Seattle is a leader on addressing climate change on many fronts, and our investment strategy is only one of the avenues we are pursuing. We are implementing a Climate Action Plan that aims to make the city carbon neutral by 2050 by making our buildings more energy efficient and putting more of our people into vibrant neighborhoods with easy access to transit, walking and biking. Our city-owned electric utility, Seattle City Light, has been carbon neutral for over eight years, strategically investing in conservation and renewable energy so that the city no longer relies on coal fired power. All of these incremental actions add up to significant reductions in carbon emissions, but we also have to tackle the big, game-changing decisions. That's why I've brought together over 75 leaders from four states to fight proposals in our region for new coal export terminals that would result in more carbon emissions than the Keystone XL pipeline.I urge Harvard and other large institutions to take a similar approach, tackling climate change from all angles. The role Harvard plays in teaching, research and scholarship, as well as the action being taking on campus, is necessary and important. But it is no longer sufficient. The impacts of climate change are real, we are experiencing them today and they will continue to worsen. We're the first generation to see the effects of climate change, and the last generation who can do anything about it. To refuse to use every tool at our disposal in this fight -- to embrace inaction -- is to endorse a trajectory that will lead to suffering, privation, and calamity. We owe it to those who our institutions and investments serve and will serve in the future to do everything we can to prevent this crisis.Sincerely,Mike McGinnMayor"}, {"title": "Urban Metabolism and the Nature of Sustainable Cities", "text": "Stephanie Pincetl is director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at UCLA. The Center studies the \"urban metabolism\" of Los Angeles and other cities. Jon Christensen, a journalist-in-residence at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA, talked with Dr. Pincetl about urban metabolism, nature in the city, and the challenges that Los Angeles and other cities face to become more sustainable in the 21st century.Jon Christensen: You study \"urban metabolism.\" What does that mean? And why do you study it?Stephanie Pincetl: Urban metabolism is an analogy. It describes the city as a living thing that requires inputs to nourish its activities, and once the flows into the city are used and metabolized, the system produces waste, just like a living organism. I study urban metabolism because it quantifies the flows into cities and enables us to understand how those flows are used. We can map those flows over socio-demographic characteristics, climate, land uses, and building types and ages, and understand where those flows are used and by whom. This provides useful insights for policy makers and others to target energy efficiency and conservation programs. It also simply reveals how much stuff is needed to keep cities going at the present rate. Urban metabolism baselines can be established over time so we can measure change as well.Jon Christensen: If cities are like organisms, what key challenges do we face to make Los Angeles and other cities sustainable living organisms?Stephanie Pincetl: One of the first key challenges is that we have an infrastructure that was built during the carbon age. LA was built during an era of cheap fuel, cheap land, cheap resources, like wood, cement, and other building materials, all made possible by the nation's rich natural resource base and inexpensive, abundant energy. The future will not be the same, and changing our infrastructure to reduce our use of carbon fuels and materials takes time and money. The development of a complete public transit system, for example, is very expensive. But even more difficult are the other urban infrastructure changes that we will have to make to change the shape of the city to make it more sustainable. These include making profound changes in single-family neighborhoods - allowing more small apartment buildings, cafes and other commerce in these neighborhoods, adding in small parks, and changing streets to complete streets. To make Los Angeles and other cities sustainable we will also need more distributed infrastructure for water and energy, such as electricity produced by roof top photovoltaic panels, and small-scale water treatment plants that produce recycled water for neighborhoods. All of these represent long-term, major changes for how Los Angeles and other cities will look and work. And they can be implemented.Jon Christensen: What are \"complete streets\"?Stephanie Pincetl: Complete streets is a term that is used to describe streets that include bike lanes, bioswales that infiltrate stormwater into the ground instead of simply sending rain water out to sea through stormwater drains, trees to shade sidewalks to make for a more pleasant pedestrian experience. Complete streets acknowledge walking and biking as equal forms of transportation to the car, and take advantage of nature to improve environmental quality.Jon Christensen: We live in an arid environment and climate change is going to affect our water supplies too. Will we have enough water for the city to thrive in the future?Stephanie Pincetl: Los Angeles is moving in a very good direction with water. Water use has been trending down over the past decade. However, there are some basic problems that are hard to resolve. Water providers need revenue. And revenue is predicated on sales. Water providers can embrace water conservation and help the public use less water, by changing outdoor landscaping, for example. But the less water people use, the less revenue the providers have, and often they have to raise rates to make up the difference, which can make customers feel cheated because they are using less and paying more. This is a vicious cycle that we need to solve. The other major problem in LA is that there are over 100 different water providers across the region. Most are public but there are also private companies, mutual water companies, and then wholesalers and retailers. This is a very complex system that is not very transparent, which makes it hard to understand, and a major challenge for better coordinating water management and more efficient water use across the region. The other big challenge is building our capacity to reuse water. Previously used water is a huge resource that is, for the most part, being wasted right now. We can treat this water to high standards, so that it can be used for drinking water, or lower standards for irrigation or industrial processes. These challenges can seem daunting, but we can solve them to make Los Angeles, and other arid cities like LA, more sustainable.Jon Christensen: What about energy? Can we make enough clean energy for the city to run on clean energy in the future?Stephanie Pincetl: Energy should not be a problem. Combining distributed solar generation, renewable gas made from agricultural and municipal waste streams, conservation and efficiency, we will have ample energy supplies.Jon Christensen: How do you think about nature in the city?   Stephanie Pincetl: Nature surrounds us everywhere in the city, we live in the midst of it all the time, but are not even aware of it. Buildings are made from concrete, made with aggregate and water. Roads are asphalt, from fossil fuel. The resources that we build with and make all our daily items with are sourced from nature. When we begin to be more aware of that, it helps us understand the fundamental materiality of cities and how much they are made from nature, far flung, perhaps, and remanufactured, but nature nonetheless. That kind of awareness can better inform our decisions about building materials, their energy intensivity -- or how much energy is embedded in the things we make -- and how the built environment is both the product of transformed nature and then transforms nature where we build."}, {"title": "Canada Fracking Protests Turn Violent; 40 Arrested After Police Cars Set On Fire", "text": "By Julie GordonOct 17 (Reuters) - Police in the eastern Canadian province of New Brunswick arrested about 40 people on Thursday after efforts to dismantle a highway barricade turned violent and protesters against shale gas exploration set several police vehicles on fire.The incident came in response to a weeks-long protest by activists and local aboriginals, who blocked a road near the town of Rexton to try to slow work by SWN Resources Canada, a subsidiary of Southwestern Energy Co, which is exploring shale gas properties in the area.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) moved in early on Thursday to break up the blockade. They said officers were attacked with Molotov cocktails and at least one shot was fired, but not by them.Susan Levi-Peters, the former chief of the nearby Elsipogtog aboriginal reserve, said the police had moved in aggressively on unarmed protesters.\"The RCMP is coming in here with their tear gas - they even had dogs on us,\" she said. \"They were acting like we're standing there with weapons, while we are standing there, as women, with drums and eagle feathers.

If you haven't heard the disgusting news about TransCanada's collusion with a Federal Bureau of Investigation/Department of Homeland Security Fusion Center, desperately targeting me and other peaceful climate activists as possible candidates for \"terrorism\" charges, you can read about it here on DeSmog Blog.Thanks to Nebraska activists filing a Freedom of Information Act request, you can see all the PowerPoint presentations for yourself on Tar Sands Blockade's website. It is pathetic to see courageous, nonviolent U.S. citizens being desperately targeted by this transnational corporate thug. Even Daryl Hannah and a Texas great grandmother (who was labeled an \"eco-terrorist\" by TransCanada for having the temerity to defend her land) are pictured. 59,520 individuals who signed the Keystone XL Pledge of Resistance as of April 24 are also mentioned. How does one even begin to respond to such an outrage?Imagine my surprise as I scrolled through Part II of TransCanada's presentation to find a photo of Tar Sands Blockade spokesperson Ron Seifert and me posing in front of my \"rocket trike\" during our 2011 Tour of Resistance down the Keystone XL pipeline route. Maybe TransCanada has never seen a recumbent trike before and thought it was a real rocket?The irony, of course, is it is actually TransCanada and the tar sands industrial complex -- blinded by the disease of greed -- that are terrorizing life on Earth through their lethal exploitation of Canadian tar sands and the construction of Keystone XL's 485-mile southern leg in Texas and Oklahoma.This is a common tactic used by guilty parties: Dishonestly accuse others of what they themselves are actually doing to deflect attention from their own sordid acts. The record will show that members of the Tar Sands Blockade (and Great Plains Tar Sands Resistance, which had one of their action camps infiltrated by undercover agents) strictly adhere to a code of nonviolence, even as TransCanada security and local law enforcement officials engage in brutal acts of physical violence against them.How dare TransCanada try to villainize U.S. citizens for fighting to secure our basic survival rights to clean air, fresh water, safe food, and a habitable planet.By directing his administration to fast-track the construction of Keystone XL's southern leg last spring, President Obama clearly emboldened TransCanada to believe they can steamroll the American people, but I have news for them: We're not easily intimidated. It may have been awhile since we acted like it as a whole, but this is still the land of the free and the home of the brave, and we don't take kindly to outsiders pushing us around.Now is the time to end the tar sands industrial complex's reign of terror against the planet, and to finish the fight against TransCanada's Keystone XL, before more of our collective future is irrevocably stolen. Please sign our petition demanding that President Obama stop the construction of Keystone XL's southern leg. If the Obama administration could conjure up a way to fast-track the pipeline's construction, it should be able to conjure up a way to stop it.Then join Texas landowner Michael Bishop and other brave souls outside the White House next month as, together, we take a stand for our children, the next seven generations, and all life on Earth.

But most of us won't know it until these catastrophic changes show up on our doorsteps.For more than two decades, science has revealed the threats of human-induced climate change, but humanity's behavior has continued unabated. According to a Pew Research Center Survey from 2010 found, only 28 percent of Americans consider climate change as a top priority. Increasing awareness among the younger generation will be a necessary milestone. As the amount of policies that support renewable energies increases, investment in the sector will also increase.However, because public opinion has a strong influence on political actions, lawmakers remain hesitant to address the issue.Teachers throughout New York City are attempting to breach this gap by properly informing the next generation about the latest social, intellectual, and scientific developments. New York University has been driving this effort for the last 12 years by hosting Saturday Science Seminars at the Silver Center for Arts and Sciences. Each month Dr. Robert J. Wallace of New York University's Steinhardt School, coordinates educational seminars for students and teachers around the city.This month, New York University's Assistant Professor of Environmental Science, Howard Schiffman hosted a meeting on the threats of what one participant referred to as 'catastrophic climate destabilization.'As depicted by Schiffman, \"communities in the island nations of the South-Pacific are waking up to ankle deep waters outside their doors because of sea-level rise.\" A less subtle example may be the path of Hurricane Sandy last year. According Jennifer Francis, a climate researcher at Rutgers University, a reduction in Arctic sea ice changed atmospheric winds in the jet stream leading to Hurricane Sandy's unusual Northwestward path.According to Schiffman, informing people about the causes and threats of climate change is central to the solution.\"If there is one thing I would like all of you to take away from this, it's that we have to break down the [communication] barriers between policy makers, scientists, and the media,\" he said.Providing Americans with accurate information regarding climate change is a worthwhile endeavor because many people still do not understand the science behind climate change.  The most basic conundrum climate change specialists face today: the reason for the public cannot fully comprehend the affects and science behind climate change. As a result, the majority of Americans do not view climate change as a pressing issue. According to a Pew Global Attitudes Survey, the United States had the largest number of respondents who said they do not worry at all about global warming.A 2013 study by Anthony Leiserowitz found that despite the 97 percent of climate scientist consensus that identifies human behavior as the cause of climate change, less than half of the American public agrees with this conclusion.The study asserts that this may help to explain why -- even though most Americans view renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives as important solutions to climate change -- many Americans do not identify driving less as a primary solution. This information is important because millions of Americans make individual choices each day that collectively have an enormous impact on the Earth's climate.According to Schiffman, social scientists are beginning to find evidence that leads to two main reasons as to why Americans largely do not care about climate change. First, most poor people think of climate change as a rich person's problem. The second reason derives from the principle of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology says that as a species, we are less able to deal with remote threats than immediate threats.The conundrum faced by the next generation is that if they choose to make dramatic changes in energy policy, they will have a limited ability to prevent, what Brian Kahn, Head of Science at the United Nations International School, refers to as, catastrophic climate destabilization if this generation doesn't begin to take significant steps to prevents it."}, {"title": "Visiting a Local Slaughterhouse Wasn't That Bad", "text": "A while back, an environmental science and photography student from NYU named Madeline Cottingham, who is also a vegan, came out to my pasture-based pig farm to work on a farm to table photography project. In addition to seeing my farm, we planned to visit my local slaughterhouse.After a tour of the farm, we had about half an hour before it was time to leave for the slaughterhouse, so we went inside for a cup of coffee, during which I brought up the fact that she is a vegan, and questioned why she would choose a livestock farm for her project. Her answer was very reasonable and straightforward: If people are going to eat meat, the animals should be humanely raised and killed. In spite of the fact that she was a vegan herself, she was willing to admit that most people would continue to eat meat; she just hoped that the animals wouldn't come from factory farms and wouldn't be killed in industrial slaughterhouses.After our cup of coffee, we hopped into her car and started off for the slaughterhouse, which is about twenty minutes from my place. On the way, I reiterated that I thought she would have fairly limited access to the kill floor. My expectation was that she would get to stand in the doorway and take pictures from there. However, much to my surprise, when we showed up and I introduced Maddy to the slaughterman running the kill floor, he immediately invited her in. First she had to don a white coat and a hard hat, which she happily did. While I watched her get ready it seemed to me that she was almost giddy with the excitement of being given access to the whole kill floor.There were only two rules on the kill floor: 1) One is not allowed to take pictures of the USDA inspector (a USDA rule) and 2) She was not allowed to take pictures of the act of stunning the animal or sticking it with the knife (a slaughterhouse rule, promulgated not out of a feeling that they have anything to hide, but out of a justified paranoia [I believe] of potentially being portrayed in a bad light).As Maddy stepped past the threshold of the door onto the kill floor, I said, \"Just let me know when you've had enough, and we'll go over to the cutting room.\" In order to keep the kill floor from getting crowded, I hung out in the doorway and watched from there.For the next half hour or so, Maddy poured over the kill floor, snapping photos of everything, only pausing when the slaughterman brought a new pig onto the floor to kill. Rather than turn away for the killing, since she couldn't photograph it, she watched, intently, as the slaughterman placed the captive bolt gun against the pig's forehead and activated it.BANG!, about as loud as a cap gun, and the pig dropped instantly to the ground each time. Then she watched just as intently as the slaughterman put down the captive bolt gun and pulled his knife out of the scabbard hanging off a white plastic chain wrapped around his waist, which he deftly and expertly plunged into the pig causing the blood to gush out in a huge stream. A moment later, which is why you have to act fast when killing pigs, the pig's death throes started, which, compared to other animals, are very violent. The pig, unconscious from the blow of the captive bolt gun, and quickly dying, and then already dead, thrashes around like mad. It is in fact the most difficult part of watching a pig killed because it is so easy to imagine that the pig is thrashing around because it is in pain (and, I grant the possibility, though remote, that we do not properly understand the physiology of death and the pig is in fact in pain, in which case what we are doing is very wrong). Nevertheless, as soon as the slaughterman pulled the knife out of the pig and stepped away, Maddy rushed in to start snapping photos again.She took pictures of everything: of the moments immediately following the kill, of the pig being hoisted up by a hind leg to finish bleeding out and then be hosed off, of the pig being skinned, of the pig's head being cut off, of the pig being disemboweled, of the pig being split in half with a bone saw, and finally of the pig halves being run down the rail to the cooler.The whole time, too, Maddy was aware that these were my pigs that were being killed. Not the very pigs that she had just seen alive and well on my farm, but the same pigs, nonetheless. They were not abstract pigs. They had faces and attitudes and personalities. They had lives that she had witnessed and documented just before seeing them killed.I thought she would never tire of the kill floor. It seemed that everything attracted her. When not much was going on, she pointed her camera down at the floor and snapped pictures of spatters of blood and bits of skin and fat, the detritus of death.Every now and then, however, she would look at me, and say, \"just a few more minutes.\" Until finally she walked over to me and said, \"OK. I'm ready.\"The cutting room is a very different place than the kill floor. Everything is pretty familiar. As the carcasses come out of the cooler, they are quickly broken down into cuts that we are used to seeing in packages at the supermarket. Nevertheless, she snapped away, just as excitedly as she had on the kill floor.After about a half an hour in the cutting room, we were ready to go. We said our thanks and left.On the way back to my place we were pretty quiet, but at one point Maddy said thoughtfully, \"You know, it wasn't that bad,\" which resonated with me because I had felt the same way the first time I watched my pigs be killed.\"Yeah,\" I said, \"I know what you mean. My first time there, I expected that watching my pigs be killed would be very difficult, maybe even traumatic, but I was really surprised at how easy it was to watch. After thinking about it, I realized that the place, the whole place, everything about it, from the tile walls, to the white coats and hard hats, to the stainless steel hooks hanging in the air, to the chains and pulleys of the hoists, to the attitudes of the people working on the floor, is perfectly designed and organized to do that job and none other. Somehow that design and organization makes it so that on the kill floor, killing seems perfectly normal, natural, even. You don't even need to distance yourself from it. You can watch, you can stand there and say to yourself, okay, this is my pig, a pig that I cared for twice a day for five months, you can even recognize the pig -- oh, look, that's that pig that liked to have its belly scratched so much that it would topple over onto its side and lay there with its legs stretched out as soon as you started rubbing it -- and then BANG! and the pig drops and the wheels of the killing machine start rolling, so smoothly that it is difficult while it is going on to question whether it is right or wrong. From start to finish it seems exactly as it should be. Simply put, it just is. You know what I mean?\" I turned my head to look at her while she was driving.\"Yeah,\" she said, nodding her head slowly while continuing to watch the road, \"I think I do. It wasn't that bad,\" she said again.A Message From Maddy:\"I grew up on a small, family run farm. I helped as we raised and cared for our animals, I helped when we killed them, and I helped to butcher and then eat them. Throughout my childhood I knew the names of the animals on my dinner plate. It was dramatic and sometimes troubling, but to me, there was nothing unique about this; it was what I knew.Photo Credit: Madeline CottinghamYou can find more of Bob Comis' writing at stonybrookfarm.wordpress.com"}, {"title": "Genetically Modified Hamster Battles Animal Cruelty, Sort Of, In New Mobile Game", "text": "This animated hamster has a good reason to be angry.Hamstrong is a genetically modified lab research animal.

Or to try to, anyway, in a new mobile game named after the heroic rodent.Geoffery Anthony, president of the Canadian animation company, GFZ Group, that made Hamstrong, said in a press release that he \"wanted our studio to create a game about animal cruelty that would not only entertain, but also provide educational value.\"And the game is, as the marketing materials promise, intuitive and fun to play. It involves Hamstrong rolling and hopping around obstacles, collecting coins and other treasures, as he races through various laboratory scenes.A worthwhile mission, though the connection with animal cruelty isn't entirely clear from the game itself, since the only animals that Hamstrong the hamster interacts with are extra-strong cockroaches -- which he tries to kill.\"Because this is the first version of the game, it doesn't have levels where Hamstrong interacts with other animals or people at the moment,\" spokesperson Ana Parfenova told HuffPost. \"We are planning on optimizing the graphics and upgrading the game in the next couple of months to include more levels, scenarios and enemies.\"The studio is planning to release a Hamstrong eBook and is also crowdfunding an animated series that will follow Hamstrong and his cohort as they more explicitly try to eradicate animal testing.

They inspire awe, because they're magnificent, massive, beautiful, powerful, and mysterious. Like giant sequoias but mammals -- like us, except on a prehistoric, mythological, global scale. Everything about them is huge -- their size, their sounds, their range, their strength, their history.They are ancient, like living dinosaurs, managing so far to survive every planetary disaster or human-caused threat, intentional and incidental, from hunting to habitat loss to pollution.

A farmer harvesting wheat on his land discovered the leak Sept. 29.A robot, known as a \"smart pig,\" detected anomalies during what Tesoro called routine internal inspections of the pipeline September 10 and 11.\"We were awaiting results of the analysis of that inspection when the leak was reported,\" Tesoro spokeswoman Tina Barbee said.North Dakota regulators said corrosion on the pipeline may have caused the spill.The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was on site investigating the spill despite the government shutdown over the last few weeks.The pipeline remains shut down while the federal regulator looks into how Tesoro responded to the spill, its control-room processes and records and whether non-compliance contributed to the pipeline's failure, said Jeannie Shiffer, PHMSA's director for Governmental, International, and Public Affairs.The ruptured pipeline runs 35 miles from Tioga to Black Slough in North Dakota. It was built by BP Plc in 1993.It is a part of Tesoro's \"High Plains\" pipeline system in North Dakota and Montana that gathers oil from the Bakken shale and delivers it to another pipeline and to Tesoro's 68,000 barrels-per-day Mandan refinery.Texas-based Tesoro bought the pipeline and the refinery from BP in 2001.The spill is the largest on U.S. soil since an Exxon Mobil pipeline spilled 5,000 to 7,000 barrels of heavy Canadian crude in Mayflower, Arkansas, last March.It is the largest oil leak in North Dakota since hydraulic fracturing unlocked massive oil reserves in the Bakken shale.

The shakeup has some inside and outside of the international financial institution worrying that the bank's development projects will not prioritize the concerns of the communities that they are intended to better.World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, who took the lead at the bank last year, has said that the reorganization is meant to reduce bureaucracy and increase collaboration.According to a presentation that leadership made to staff in late September and obtained by The Huffington Post, it appears likely that the now-separate social development work is slated to be folded into other areas. Overall, the reorganization seeks to apportion the bank's work into 14 \"Global Practice\" areas, which have working titles such as agriculture, education, poverty, water and energy and extractives.Some staff are concerned that this will result in social development getting lumped in with urban and rural development, rather standing on its own.\"We're going backwards by focusing on big infrastructure -- bigger, fewer projects,\" said a bank staffer who works on social issues who asked not to be named.The staffer said that the bank currently employs about 45 people who focus on social development. Those staffers oversee the implementation of social safeguards and consult with the local community on projects like roads, bridges and power plants, addressing issues that may arise like conflict, indigenous rights and the effects of development. As the bank itself describes the work, social development \"puts people first.\"The staffer said that there is concern throughout the unit, which includes sociologists and anthropologists as well as lawyers and economists, that their work will not be as valued in the new organization structure, and that if it is lumped in with other programs, the social aspects will become just \"a check box\" on the path to approving projects, rather than a focal point.\"Social issues are what make projects complicated,\" said the staffer. \"You can build all you want, but if you don't include the people around you, all you've got are bricks and mortar.\"The staffer also predicted that the proposed reorganization will make it \"hard to attract talent that can really engage on social issues,\" if they feel like that specialization is not seen as valuable.The bank itself is seems aware of these concerns. In response to a request for comment about the reorganization and social development, the bank's press office pointed to a Storify page it curated during the meeting that invites public dialogue on social inclusion, and to a report, \"Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity,\" released at last week's meeting.\"Social development is central to achieving the WBG goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity and will be a critical component of the new urban, rural and social global practice,\" said Fionna Douglas, communications manager with the bank's Sustainable Development Network in an email to The Huffington Post. \"We anticipate emerging work to focus on crime and violence particularly in an urban setting,\" she said. \"[W]e expect social development to be a key theme in our governance and social accountability work going forward. The social development team will also support the work of other practices to ensure that social dimensions are mainstreamed across WBG activities.\"The reorganization has also drawn attention from outside groups that follow the bank closely. The international finance watchdog group Bretton Woods Project noted in its wrap-up of last week's meetings that this will be the \"biggest reorganization of the Bank in about two decades.\" Their report also cites \"gloomy rumblings from Bank staff,\" though it says the mood is better than it has been under previous leadership. Some of the concern noted in the report comes from staff who are worried that their positions will be cut entirely.The Bank Information Center -- a watchdog group aimed at pushing the bank toward broader social inclusion in its decision-making -- said in a statement after the meeting that the reorganization could allow for improvements on the social front, if handled properly. \"The reorganization, under the leadership of President Jim Yong Kim, is an opportunity for the Bank to reallocate resources to upgrade and enhance the implementation of its social and environmental standards, which deliver several benefits for poor communities,\" said the group. \"Alternatively, if the Bank makes the mistake of viewing safeguards as an afterthought rather than an integral part of the solution, it might reduce the numbers or authority of its safeguard specialists and increase the risks of harm to the poor and vulnerable.\"Environmental groups have also been critical of the bank for continuing to fund coal projects abroad, despite a new policy stating that it would only do so in \"rare cases\" when there is \"no feasible alternative.\"Bruce Rich, author of the book Foreclosing the Future: The World Bank and the Politics of Environmental Destruction, was more critical of the reorganization plans at a rally last week, arguing that \"the strategy ignores worsening, systemic institutional failings in the Bank\" and would \"foster the continuation of a dysfunctional internal culture\" that \"funds massive mining and fossil fuel power schemes and giant hydroelectric dams that impoverish rather than help local populations.\""}, {"title": "Colorado Oil And Gas Industry Spends Over $600,000 To Fight Fracking Moratoriums", "text": "Campaign finance reports filed this week show that the oil and gas industry has contributed over half a million dollars to groups that are fighting fracking moratoriums on the ballot in four Colorado cities.Contributions from the Colorado Oil and Gas Association to pro-industry groups make up over 99 percent of the combined $606,205 raised.

The tour there was equally successful, garnering national media attention and quickly scoring a few early victories, with a number of large churches committing to divestment and the New Zealand Greens adopting the goal.Since the first Do The Math tour over a year ago, the case for divestment has only grown stronger as the movement grows. The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reiterated the math which the tour helped to bring to light: that the fossil fuel industry has five times more carbon in its reserves than we can safely burn and still keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. That bombshell was first elucidated by the Carbon Tracker Institute in the UK and has subsequently been backed up by reports from the World Bank, HSBC, International Energy Agency, and more.To put it another way, all of these organizations have concluded that the current business plan of the fossil fuel industry is incompatible with sustaining human civilization as we know it. Hence, the need for a powerful divestment campaign.Thankfully, the divestment campaign is gaining strength every day. Last week, the University of Oxford released a study concluding that current effort is the fastest growing divestment campaign in history and poses a far-reaching and serious threat to the fossil fuel industry's bottom line.Europe is the next front in the growing movement. Home to some of the largest stock exchanges and corporations in the world, making progress in Europe will be key if the divestment effort wants to pose a serious threat to the fossil fuel industry.At the moment, divestment campaigns are furthest along in the UK, where the organization People & Planet is spearheading an effort on university campuses. A parallel movement is underway at religious institutions across the country, led by organizations like Project Noah and Bright Now. Last week, the UK Quakers, who helped lead the fight against the British Empire's slave trade in the 19th century, signed on to support the new divestment campaign.Divestment efforts are also sprouting up in countries like Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, where the Swedish Centre Party -- part of Sweden's four-party government coalition -- has called on the country's pension funds, which manage $146 billion in assets, to sell off their fossil fuel stocks.This month's Fossil Free Europe tour will aim to inspire even more activism across the continent, as well as connect European efforts with the movement in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

With a little do-it-yourself work and imagination, All Hallows' Eve can go green, too.Like any holiday, Halloween offers an opportunity to go green without sacrificing an ounce of festive fun. Going green for Halloween is also a nice way to cut down on spending, as the average American is projected to spend over $75 toward the October 31st festivities.With a bit of innovation, the staples of Halloween -- costumes, candy and trick-or-treating -- can all be redone with the environment in mind without sacrificing the spooky spirit of Halloween.  Also, check out our helpful infographic, Halloween: Recycled.Plastic is perilousReady for a scary statistic? According to World Watch, Americans throw away 100 billion plastic bags every year. Yes, that's billion with a \"b,\" or in other words, 230 bags for every person in the U.S.Avoiding plastic bags is the environmentally conscious choice whether it's Halloween or a regular trip to the grocery store, but trick-or-treating offers a chance to go plastic-free and show off your creativity. An old t-shirt can be upcycled into a trick-or-treating bag relatively easily, and not only will you child's candy bag stand out from the rest of the neighborhood's plastic bags, it'll hold more candy and be more durable.Trick-or-trash-pickupFor safety reasons, most houses that welcome trick-or-treaters make sure any candy that's given out is individually wrapped and sealed. Doing this makes sense to avoid contamination and tampering, but it isn't exactly eco-conscious. According to the EPA, over 30 percent of municipal solid waste in the U.S. comes in the form of packaging, including the fun-size candy wrappers for Halloween treats.Unfortunately, candy wrappers are not as easily recyclable as other types of paper and plastic because they're comprised of mixed materials. This doesn't mean we should give up on recycling candy wrappers, though. Terracycle accepts shipments of approved candy wrappers to be recycled, including most of the fun-size wrappers handed out on Halloween. Other types of wrappers, like the foil from a Hershey's Kiss, can be recycled in a curbside bin along with other recyclables.Frightening, yet frugal costumingFor many, the most appealing part of Halloween is the chance to be whomever -- or whatever -- you want for the day. One step in a Halloween store, however, and it's apparent that store-bought Halloween costumes aren't always cheap. They're also wasteful, as producing new costumes every year requires the use of resources and leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions.It's estimated that the textile and apparel industry accounts for 10 percent of the world's entire carbon impact. To cut back on your carbon footprint this Halloween, check out a local thrift stores to build your costume or swap costumes with a friend.If you're struggling for costume ideas, as many do, don't be afraid to look to a Halloween store for inspiration. This year, an estimated 32.8 percent of Americans will find their costume idea at a retail store.

As the months have passed, I've enjoyed watching the ticker continually rise on the amount of solar power our panels have generated. I love knowing that our home is more powered by the sun, and less by dirty coal mined by blowing up the beautiful mountains in Appalachia.  And across the U.S, I'm not alone! Rooftop solar power is expanding exponentially, and the Sierra Club just celebrated our 1,000th solar home as part of our Solar Homes initiative.  The Solar Homes Program is a partnership between the Sierra Club and the country's leading rooftop-solar providers to help members and supporters go solar, save money, and cut climate pollution. Plus, every time a home goes solar, the local Sierra Club chapter receives funds for its important work protecting the environment.   The partnership has been around for two years now and is operating in eight states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York.  Those 1,000 (now 1,027 as of today!) rooftop solar home systems have generated 169,423,388 kilowatt hours of electricity!This clean energy equals 257,297,124 lbs of carbon avoided; the equivalent of taking 24, 314 cars off the road; and is the equivalent of planting 2,998,793 trees.  My colleague Jesse Simons was the major force behind launching our Solar Homes initiative and he's excited to see the success of the program. He utilized the program to put panels on his roof as well.  \"It just fits with my job and how I see myself -- I don't want to just advocate for clean energy, I want to make it part of who I am and how I live,\" says Jesse. \"It also saves me $30 every month!\"  He says the process was easy and loves that his plug-in hybrid is now powered by those panels as well. \"I'm averaging 93 mpg right now and saving nearly $2,000 a year on gas.\"  Watching solar power expand so quickly across our country is inspiring, and I'm so happy our Solar Homes initiative is helping that happen. Jesse said it best when he and I were talking recently.  \"It's important that people realize we aren't talking about the future - clean energy is here and ready now,\" says Jesse. \"In fact, in 14 states solar is cheaper for many homeowners than dirty fossil fuels from the grid!\"  Join us in the solar revolution!"}, {"title": "Fracking: The Other EPA Shutdown", "text": "Positive news stories during the shutdown of government services were scarce, so it was nice to read this one about furloughed scientists from the Water Protection Division of the EPA in Atlanta deciding to volunteer some of their (unexpectedly) free time cleaning up a local creek. \"All of us really believe that our life's work is to protect and restore rivers and streams for people and animals that rely on them -- paid or not,\" said EPA biologist Lisa Gordon.Sometimes we overlook that the EPA (and the rest of our government, for that matter) is made up of people who take pride in serving their community and doing a good job. And as I've written before, we need the EPA to have our back when it comes to protecting the water we drink and the air we breathe. If they don't, we're in big trouble.Unfortunately, when it comes to hydraulic fracturing (fracking), the EPA has let down its guard. Go to the EPA's webpage on fracking, and the first sentence sounds like it came from a fossil fuel PR flak: \"Natural gas plays a key role in our Nation's clean energy future.\"Even if you defined \"key role\" as a dirty and dangerous drilling boom with lax and inconsistent regulation as the result of loopholes in seven major federal laws and regulatory programs, that sentence would still be only half-true. That's because natural gas is unequivocally not part of any clean energy future. As long as we're still drilling and burning gas, we still have at least one foot stuck in the dirty-fuel past.Far worse than Orwellian website rhetoric about the future, though, is the EPA's failure to respond to on-the-ground harm that fracking is causing to communities right now. Over the past year, the agency has shut down its own fracking-related water contamination investigations in Dimock, Pennsylvania; Parker County, Texas; and Pavillion, Wyoming. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, in at least one case (Dimock, PA), this happened in spite of evidence from the EPA's water tests that the drinking water was polluted with fracking chemicals.Next week, I'll join thousands of young activists who care about a real clean energy future at Power Shift in Pittsburgh, PA. One thing we'll be doing is challenging EPA Director Gina McCarthy to reopen the investigations into fracking contamination of local water supplies in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. You can add your voice to our message here.The problems with fracking aren't limited to just a few states, though -- they extend across the U.S. and around the world. If you care about the drinking water where you live, you owe it to yourself to join Global Frackdown, which is this Saturday, October 19. The EPA may have taken its eye off the ball, but many good people around the world are refusing to stand by while the oil and gas industries recklessly threaten our drinking water.

It was the largest oil spill in the current Bakken boom and may prove to be the largest land spill in U.S. history. While oil companies have so far avoided concerns of environmentalists, they may not be able to evade a lawsuit alleging lost income by mineral rights' holders due to the flaring of natural gas.August 2013 Flaring in the Bakken (Credit: G. Nienaber)This week, North Dakota mineral owners filed ten class action lawsuits in North Dakota state district court against oil companies operating in North Dakota's Bakken oilfield. The issue is not the transport and leaking of oil through an aging infrastructure. Plaintiffs are seeking damages for natural gas flaring from oil wells that are in violation of state flaring laws.The lawsuits allege that North Dakota mineral rights owners \"lost millions of dollars in royalties due to producers' practice of burning off large quantities of gas rather than selling it,\" according to a press release issued by North Dakota's Baumstark Braaten Law Partners and four law firms from Wyoming, Texas, Colorado and Montana. The respondents named are Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Continental Resources, Crescent Point Energy, HRC Operating, Marathon Oil, Samson Resources, SM Energy, Statoil, WPX Energy and XTO Energy.The lawsuits seek to force operators to comply with state law and pay royalties to mineral owners on the value of flared gas. Attorneys say that Bakken natural gas is some of the most valuable gas in the country due to its density of natural gas liquids.A July 2013 report by the sustainability think tank CERES says that North Dakota natural gas flaring has more than doubled in two years. Although estimates from CERES say 70 percent of North Dakota's natural gas is marketed, the rest is wastefully burned off due to a lack of pipelines and other infrastructure.According to the class action suit, \"North Dakota allows limited flaring during the first year after an oil well enters production if certain oil production limits are followed; then after a year, a producer must apply for a written exemption for any future flaring. Ifit [sic] fails to do so it must pay royalties and state taxes on the flared gas.\"The economic angle on flaring is unique and a stark departure from efforts by environmentalists to focus on the dangers of drilling, fracking, and the transport of oil through sensitive landscapes. Besides the wasteful economics of flaring, there are other concerns as well.Money unfortunately always trumps aesthetics, and money cannot buy the spiritual experience of a clean and clear night sky.Flaring is not only destroying the night sky on Indian lands; it is also ruining the nightscape in one of America's most rugged landscapes -- Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The effect on the night skies is so obvious, that the park's Summer 2013 Visitor's Guide commented on the effects of the oil boom, noting that each new well means another drill rig, well pad, pumpjack, debris pit, flare pit, storage tanks and access road on the landscape.Red Skies at Night Theodore Roosevelt National Park August 2013 (Photo: G.

The United States has gaining the dubious distinction of being number four in the world's top ten flaring countries, due to the Bakken flares.In the CERES report, \"Flaring Up\", the think tank writes, \"absolute volumes of flared gas more than doubled between May 2011 and May 2013, resulting in the loss of approximately $1 billion in fuel and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions equivalent to adding one million cars to the road.\"As the class action lawsuit notes, gas has a much lower value to developers than oil, and as a result it is cheaper to burn it off than installing the infrastructure to harvest it. Dollars are literally going up in smoke -- $3.6 million a day -- and that smoke is going directly into people's lungs. It is not just the 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide that should worry western North Dakota residents. Black carbon is part of the emission process, and receives a very bad grade from the World Health Organization.\"Epidemiological studies provide sufficient evidence of the association of cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality with exposure to black carbon.

Hearings for the remaining activists are expected in the coming days.\"We are writing to ask you to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy... are dropped and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law,\" the Nobel laureates said in their open letter to Putin.The letter, whose signatories included South African anti-apartheid campaigner Desmond Tutu, described the Sept. 18 protest in which the activists tried to scale the Prirazlomnaya oil rig as \"a peaceful, non-violent protest\".Russian coastguards forcibly boarded the Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise icebreaker after the protest and towed it to the northern port city of Murmansk, where all aboard were arrested.Putin has said the 30 detainees - who come from 18 countries - are not pirates, though their protest violated the law, and his human rights aide has urged the law enforcement bodies to drop the piracy charges.A local court in Murmansk on Thursday denied bail to two more of the activists, Colin Russel of Australia and Mannes Ubels of the Netherlands.Russia's top investigative body has said the activists may face fresh charges after it said drugs were found on the Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace denies there were any illegal items aboard.The Greenpeace protest targeted the Prirazlomnaya oil platform, owned by Russia's state giant Gazprom and a key element in Russia's plan to tap into the Arctic's resources.Other signatories of Thursday's letter included American Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for seeking to ban anti-personnel landmines, and Adolfo Perez Esquivel, who won in 1980 for his human rights activism in Argentina.

Both nominal and real crude oil prices are higher today than they were in the mid-1970s.40 years after the embargo, the U.S. still relies on petroleum for over a third of its energy and uses about 20 percent of all oil consumed worldwide. Yet oil demand in the U.S. and other developed nations peaked in 2005 and per capita oil consumption in the U.S. has dropped since 1973.The U.S. economy uses 60 percent less oil per unit of GDP than it did in the early 1970s, according to a report from the nonpartisan Securing America's Future Energy organization, but it still remains vulnerable to high oil prices and fluctuations on the international market.Most gas stations, including this one in Oak Grove, Ore., reduced their hours and closed on Sundays. Photo by David Falconer.The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia in 2013 to become to the world's biggest oil producer, counting natural gas and biofuels along with crude oil. U.S. petroleum imports as a share of total consumption reached a 21-year low in 2012, with only 40 percent of our oil coming from foreign sources. In 1973, about 35 percent was imported. The dramatic surge in domestic fossil fuel production is due in large part to the boom in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil and gas in shale formations across the country.Along with this uptick in unconventional oil production, alternative energy development, new battery and grid technologies and improvements in energy efficiency are poised to shift energy demand and create a \"historic opportunity\" for the U.S. to \"lead a counterrevolution\" against the traditional energy world created by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) of the Middle East, Africa and South America, energy experts Amy Meyers Jaffe and Edward Morse argued in Foreign Policy magazine.\"Energy innovation is taking many forms in the United States, creating major export opportunities and giving Washington the tools it needs to ensure that the conditions of a 1973-style oil embargo will not repeat themselves,\" they wrote.These images come from photographer David Falconer, who covered the fuel shortage in Western states in 1973 and 1974 as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's DOCUMERICA program.From the U.S. National Archives: This father and son made a sign warning thieves of the possible consequences.

What led to that interest?Timothy Egan: I've always loved the outdoors. And, as a third-generation Westerner, I have the greatest outdoor environment in the world as the source of my passion. When I was growing up, in a big family with little money and certainly no summer home, my family would go camping in Montana, or Idaho, or the Washington Cascades. My mother always said we were rich -- because of the public land domain, the parks and national forests. That was our summer home.Mark Tercek: From your perspective, what is the environmental movement doing well? What could we do better?Timothy Egan: I think environmentalists have done a very good job at sounding alarms early on, and then finding a narrative to connect the public to it. But this cuts both ways: You can cry wolf too many times, and then the public stops listening. In this same realm, I think one of the biggest things going on now is restoration. We see rivers running clean and almost wild again. Salmon runs have been restored in the northwest. Clearcut slopes are recovering. This narrative of restoration is a positive story that balances the alarms.At the same time, the movement could do more to expand its base of support, speak more to people who aren't professional environmentalists. This nation is full of birders and anglers and hunters and hikers -- all part of the natural constituency of the environment.Mark Tercek: You've written about two environmental disasters -- the Great Fire of 1910 and the Dust Bowl -- and their roles as turning points in the conservation movement. What can we learn today from those events?Timothy Egan: Both of these catastrophic events are with us still. The fire set a pattern: thereafter, the Forest Service tried to put out every fire, or nearly so. This led to fuel buildup and some of the problems we have today. Fire is part of nature -- I think most land managers finally accept this. But what's tragic is that in 1910's Big Burn and today we still lose human beings in blow-ups, and people should never have to die saving a summer home, or even a forest.The Dust Bowl was a mini-climate change event. People say you can't change the climate -- we did, in the 1930s, altering an entire area. The Dust Bowl was the worst man-caused environmental disaster in our history. We've learned some lessons about soil conservation and restoring our grasslands (I particularly like The Nature Conservancy's prairie preserve in Oklahoma). But we haven't learned some other lessons: that of hubris, of not respecting nature. Under that dust bowl is the vast Ogallala Aquifer, which is being drawn down at an unsustainable rate, a rate that will leave much of that area uninhabited. That's a lesson not learned.Mark Tercek: A few decades from now, I suppose you may write a book about today's natural disasters -- climate change, Hurricane Sandy, record droughts and floods. What do you hope the storyline will be?Timothy Egan: There was a great t-shirt that appeared after the Bay Area earthquake of 1989: nature bats last. That's what I hope the storyline will be. But it could be: science denial wins.Mark Tercek: As a vocal critic of the current gridlock in Congress, what's your advice for rebuilding bipartisan support for conservation?Timothy Egan: Yes, this has never been a partisan issue. The leading early environmentalists were all Republicans -- Teddy Roosevelt, foremost among them. The way to make it bipartisan is to convince people that the consequence of doing nothing hurts all of us. There is no such thing as a red or blue state environmental event; the victims are not from one party, one region.Mark Tercek: You've said that the American West has always been a struggle between possibility and possession. How do you see that struggle playing out today?Timothy Egan: I'm erring on the side of optimism on this one because I've always believed Wallace Stegner's maxim that the West is the geography of hope. Twenty years ago, issues like old growth forests, salmon and endangered species were considered intractable. Now, we have broad successes in all those areas.Mark Tercek: You are a big advocate for public lands conservation. This is an important strategy for The Nature Conservancy, but we also think the private sector can play an important role in addressing environmental challenges. What do you think of this strategy?Timothy Egan: It's a great strategy. Some of the best things to happen in our shared spaces have come from private donors stepping in, finding a steward like The Nature Conservancy, and then restoring or protecting the land. The feds are weak right now, because of the deficit and fiscal restraint and political gridlock -- all the more need for the private approach.Mark Tercek: You are a master storyteller in your writing. What advice do you have for conservationists as we try to tell our story better and build more support for our cause?Timothy Egan: Good question. We're a narrative people, a narrative nation. No great public policy triumph has come about without connecting policy to story. That's what Teddy Roosevelt did after the Big Burn -- and it saved the national forests. That's what Franklin D. Roosevelt did with Dust Bowl -- and it led to grassland restoration and the Soil Conservation Service. All of these issues are so much more engaging if you put them in the perspective of our ongoing national story.Timothy Egan worked for The New York Times for 18 years\u2014as Pacific Northwest correspondent and a national enterprise reporter.

So often is this the case, that when I joined Climate Counts in the summer of 2011, my mantra became, \"We need to make this less about the polar bears.\"Well, here I am, 10 days out from joining my friends at Polar Bears International on a 5-day excursion of the frozen tundra to broadcast about climate change in Churchill, Manitoba (polar bear capital of the world) and I'm hoping against hope the great white beasts haven't been listening. Drip, goes the irony.Truth be told, while the primary goal of the trip is to conduct a series of climate change web events targeted at university students, corporate sustainability folks and the zoo and aquarium community, for me it's become a soul-searching mission.The longer I sit on the front lines of the climate issue, the more I understand the elements at play:1) While the greenhouse effect is a seemingly elementary concept, human-caused climate change is abstract to the point that is completely depersonalized. Unless you're living in the Maldives and your island is sinking, it is difficult for subtle changes in weather to motivate people to modify their consumption habits or to vote in a way that may address the problem;2) Journalistic integrity is dead (or dying at least) and we've become victims of a fractured, hyper-partisan media space; one where years of peer-reviewed, scientific research can be discounted with distorted facts and amplified mightily with a few strokes of the keyboard and the right media partner (see the Daily Mail with nearly 200,000 shares on \"arctic cooling\");And, 3) In the U.S., as Monty Python's Eric Idle so rightly points out, half of our country has gone to ideological loo-loo birds who would rather take the other half of the country hostage, instead of governing toward a set of compromises that best represent the sentiments of the entire country, let alone the global community writ large.Alas, I'm not heading to the sunny, expansive tundra of Churchill, Manitoba to gripe about any of the above issues. To the contrary, I'm going in search of hope: a great, white, furry hope that can set me down the path of enlightenment.I'm convinced that environmentalists (a term that has become a four-letter word in many circles) can bring a better game to how we're getting the message across to the masses. The thinking needs to change, and it needs to embrace a broader audience with revolutionary, solutions-oriented concepts like zero waste, edible packaging and flying, hydro-powered cars.As a movement, we need to get past trying to change people's beliefs, and focus our energy on trying to shape people's behaviors. We need to work more openly to inspire, motivate and challenge the average Joe and Jolene to think critically about what they're hearing and from whom. And finally, we need to make climate change less about extreme weather, the Koch brothers, and battling an inept Congress.Perhaps, in the end, it's not so bad to make this about our fuzzy, black-nosed friends in the Arctic after all. See you in Manitoba!"}, {"title": "Pesticides On Foods Aren't Going Away Anytime Soon, But Here's What You Can Do About It", "text": "This morning, the Hawaiian island of Kauai passed a bill strictly limiting how and where large farms and biotech companies can spray pesticides. Bill 2491 will force agricultural companies to disclose when and where they spray pesticides, restrict spraying to a certain distance away from public areas, and disclose what genetically engineered crops they grow.Perhaps Bill 2491 will be the beginning of a movement across the United States to further limit pesticide use, which, according to a report published in Environmental Sciences Europe last year, increased by 404 million pounds from 1996 to 2011.Until then, the sad truth is pesticides are everywhere: the air, the water, and your food, and they\u2019ve been linked to birth defects, poisoning deaths and a wide range of illnesses.So here are some reminders on how to mitigate the pesticides covering your fruit and vegetables, and which produce are the most (and least!) pesticide-residue prone.1. Wash Your Food, All of It, and Wash It Right  Thoroughly wash all your produce. No, rubbing the apple on your shirt before biting in is not enough. According to the National Pesticide Information Center, even organic foods and foods that you peel should first be washed. The NPIC recommends that you wash your produce under running water rather than dunking or soaking it. Scrub produce with tough skin, like melons or potatoes. In addition, dry your fruits and vegetables with a towel.2. Stick With The Insides  Whenever possible, peel your fruits and vegetables. Residue can get stuck in the crevices of peels and be difficult to remove. Toss the outside layer of leafy vegetables. Even with meat, it is best to cut off the excess fat and skin, which could have absorbed pesticide residue.3. Mix It Up  The NPIC suggests eating a variety of fruits and vegetables so as to prevent overexposure to a single pesticide. You should be doing this anyway to make sure you\u2019re getting all your needed nutrients, remember?4. Grow Your Own  The best way to control what\u2019s on your vegetables is to grow your own. This may sound daunting, especially with colder temperatures on the way. But there are several vegetables that can be grown indoors, such as tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers and eggplants. Got a windowsill? Cool, now you\u2019ve got a vegetable garden.5. Eat Organic -- It\u2019s Easier Than You Think  People often bristle at being told to eat organic. Organic produce can be expensive, difficult to find, and who has the time to chase down which farmer\u2019s market is open on which day. If this sounds like you, consider a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) club. CSAs ensure you know from whom exactly you are buying your produce. Often CSAs end up being more economical because they give you a limited amount each time, which prevents overbuying and letting food go to waste. Many organic CSAs exist, and many of them deliver your goods to your door. To find one in your area, try Local Harvest\u2019s CSA finder. And remember -- even organic produce can have pesticide residue on it from nearby farms or contaminated transportation methods, so still wash everything thoroughly!6. Be Wary When Buying These  Each year, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) releases its \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of the 12 foods found to be most contaminated with pesticide residues. The organization ranks 48 fruits and vegetables based on thousands of samples tested by the USDA and FDA. These tests are done after produce is washed and peeled, giving the consumer an idea of which produce maintain higher levels of toxicity even after proper precautions. Topping the Dirty Dozen list are apples (99% of apples test positive for some pesticide residue), celery, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, grapes (a single grape tested positive for 15 pesticide residues), hot peppers, imported nectarines (every single nectarine sampled in the test came up positive for pesticide residue), peaches, potatoes, spinach, strawberries and sweet bell peppers.7. And Buy More Of These  The EWG concurrently releases a \u201cClean Fifteen\u201d list of the fruits and vegetables with the least pesticide residue. Their favorite low-pesticide fruits and vegetables include asparagus, avocados, cabbage, cantaloupe, sweet corn, eggplant, grapefruit, kiwi, mangos and mushrooms. Remember -- that doesn\u2019t mean these items had no pesticide residue, just less."}, {"title": "The 2013 Atlantic Hurricane Season Has Been Eerily Quiet; But Why?", "text": "From Climate Central's Andrew Freedman:Nearly one year after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, the 2013 Atlantic Hurricane Season has not produced a single land-falling hurricane in the U.S. Instead of having above-average storm activity, as the seasonal hurricane outlooks unanimously called for, the season has been quiet \u2014 notable for its inactivity.The tropical season doesn\u2019t officially end until November 30, but it would take a barrage of late-season storms to bring the season up to average levels, let alone above average, something that forecasters say is unlikely.\u201cIt\u2019s not only quiet, but it\u2019s got the potential to be near record quiet for the Atlantic Basin,\u201d Chris Landsea, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said.So far, there have been just 11 named storms, two of which have been hurricanes, and none that have been major hurricanes.While pre-season outlooks rarely, if ever, have pinpoint accuracy, they don\u2019t usually miss by such a large margin. In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projected that there would likely be between 13 and 20 named storms (with sustained winds of at least 39 mph). Of those storms, NOAA projected that between seven and 11 would achieve hurricane status (winds of at least 74 mph); and that three or four would become major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 (winds of at least 111 mph).By one measure, 2013 so far ranks as the 7th quietest season in the past 70 years. That measure uses an index known as Accumulated Cyclone Energy, which incorporates how many storms formed, how long they lasted, and how strong they became. If no additional storms were to form before the end of the season, 2013 would be the 4th quietest.There has not been a major hurricane in either the North Atlantic Basin or the eastern Pacific this year, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 1968, according to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher and seasonal forecaster at Colorado State University.Subsidence and the SaharaThe scant number of storms is surprising given some of the favorable conditions that exist that would normally fuel tropical cyclones. The ocean waters throughout the North Atlantic are warmer than average, the trade winds are lighter, and there is no El Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific to ramp up high altitude winds that can tear nascent storms apart.Forecasters say that three main features loom large for the inactivity: large areas of sinking air, frequent plumes of dry, dusty air coming off the Sahara Desert, and above-average wind shear. None of those features were part of their initial calculations in making seasonal projections. Researchers are now looking into whether they can be predicted in advance like other variables, such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events.In this handout provided by the U.S. Air Force, an Air Force Reserve pararescueman from the 920th Rescue Wing scans the landscape of Nederland, Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, 13 September 2008. (Photo by Paul Flipse/US Air Force via Getty Images)Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami, said that across the Atlantic this season \u201cyou had air sinking through a pretty large depth of the atmosphere.\u201d Sinking air inhibits storm formation by causing air to become drier and more stable, thereby stunting the growth of thunderstorms that require moist, unstable air in order to thrive.Tropical weather systems depend on a plentiful supply of warm, moist air to form and intensify, and when these storms ingest exceptionally dry air, as many of the storms have this year, they can choke to death in a matter of hours or days. For example, Tropical Storm Karen formed in the Gulf of Mexico, where landfall in the U.S. or Mexico is virtually assured, but died before reaching land because of the presence of dry air and strong wind shear.Some of the dry air across the Atlantic Basin came from large areas of dusty air that originated in the scorching Sahara Desert. However, such outbreaks of dusty air are fairly typical during hurricane season. What has been unusual has been the broad expanse of sinking and drying air throughout the North Atlantic basin, McNoldy said.This season, the dry air \u201cmade a huge difference\u201d and \u201csquashed all the other factors that looked good,\u201d he said.Klotzbach said the area where most tropical storms and hurricanes form had the driest mid-to-lower atmospheric conditions during the Aug. 1 to Sept. 25 period since reliable records began in 1970.In addition to the dry air, Landsea and Klotzbach pointed to above-average wind shear as another key reason. Wind shear is the difference in wind speed and direction between the ocean surface and the mid-to-upper atmosphere. Strong shear can knock storms off balance, essentially tearing them apart and allowing dry air to enter their circulation.Landsea said that NOAA\u2019s seasonal outlooks focused on the other pieces of the puzzle that argued in favor of an above average to average season, namely the absence of El Nino and the presence of warm sea surface temperatures. The seasonal outlook won\u2019t be correct every time, Landsea said.Klotzbach, who along with William Gray pioneered the art of forecasting the severity of hurricane seasons, said future outlooks will need to incorporate more variables.\u201cWe will be looking at ways to be able to incorporate more moisture data into our models, in hopes to not make a similar mistake in future years,\u201d he said in an email interview.Record Major Hurricane Drought ContinuesThe absence of a major hurricane in the U.S. this season means the continuation of a record-long streak. On Oct. 24, it will be exactly 8 years since the last major hurricane of Category 3 strength or greater made landfall. Scientists fear this streak of good luck is leading to more severe cases of \u201churricane amnesia,\u201d which can complicate emergency preparation efforts the next time a monster storm threatens.\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t happen often you certainly become a little more lax,\u201d McNoldy said, noting that in the 8 years since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida, tens of thousands of people have moved to the Sunshine State, many of whom have never before experienced a major hurricane. These residents, McNoldy said, may be less willing to evacuate their homes before the next major storm strikes.\u201cPeople who have never experienced it . . . don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re in for,\u201d McNoldy said.In this GOES satellite handout photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Tropical Storm Karen churns in the Gulf of Mexico on October 05, 2013. (Photo by NOAA via Getty Images)Klotzbach said the \u201cfear of complacency\u201d grows as the major hurricane gap lengthens. \u201cOne statistic that people should remember is that on average, about 1 in every 3 major hurricanes makes landfall at major hurricane strength (in the U.S.)\u201d he said. Klotzbach noted that since 2005, 22 major hurricanes formed in the Atlantic, yet none of them made landfall in the U.S. as major hurricanes.Even without a major hurricane reaching land, the U.S. has seen its fair share of damaging storms in recent years. Hurricane Ike devastated the Galveston, Texas area in 2008 as a strong Category 2 storm, and Sandy was one of the strongest and most destructive storms to ever strike the Jersey Shore.\u201cI think anybody living along the Jersey coast or Long Island or in New York City would attest that they had a major event even though it wasn\u2019t a major hurricane,\u201d Landsea said."}, {"title": "Cannabidiol Could Help Treat Multiple Sclerosis", "text": "The Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology has published a study showing that marijuana contains chemical compounds that could help treat Multiple Sclerosis-like diseases by preventing inflammation in the spinal cord and brain.For this particular study the researcher's, Drs.

Adelson from the Center for the Biology of Addictive Diseases and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, took immune cells isolated from paralyzed mice that specifically target and harm the brain and spinal cord, and treated them with either CBD or THC.In both instances, the laboratory mice's immune cells created fewer inflammatory molecules, principally one referred to as interleukin 17, or IL-17, which is powerfully related to multiple sclerosis and quite destructive to nerve cells.\"Inflammation is part of the body's natural immune response, but in cases like MS it gets out of hand,\" Dr. Kozela explained. \"Our study looks at how compounds isolated from marijuana can be used to regulate inflammation to protect the nervous system and its functions.\"The study's researchers determined that the manifestation of CBD or THC confines the immune cells from prompting the production of inflammatory molecules and in turn limits the molecules' capacity to reach and damage the spinal cord and/or brain.Although further research is necessary to exhibit the efficacy of cannabinoids in treating multiple sclerosis in humans, the study's researchers claim their latest findings give good reason to be optimistic.\"When used wisely, cannabis has huge potential,\" Dr. Kozela declared. \"We're just beginning to understand how it works.\"Check out the free The 420 Times iPhone and iPad App on the iTunes Store and Android App available on Google Play.

It was first identified as needing federal protection in 1975. Almost 40 years later, the 18 surviving populations are threatened by development, logging, quarrying, camping, invasive species and hydropower dams.What about the more than 750 imperiled plants and animals across the country that the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz., a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 625,000 members dedicated to the protection of endangered species and wild places, and the federal Fish and Wildlife Service are seeking to protect? Should you care about them?Noah Greenwald, the center\u2019s endangered species program director who is based in Portland, Ore., thinks you should care a lot. \u201cThis is not just about one plant in Georgia and Alabama,\u201d he said.An extinction crisis \u201cMany scientists around the globe say we are in an extinction crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey say we are experiencing a greatly accelerated rate of extinction that has become 1,000 to 10,000 times the historical rate of extinction.\u201d In fact, according to the center, the extinction crisis is the world\u2019s sixth mass extinction of plants and animals and the worst loss of species since the dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago. The fear among scientists, Greenwald said, is that by 2050, 30 to 50 percent of all the species on the planet could be headed toward extinction.People should care about extinction of seemingly obscure plants and animals, even if they do not live, work or play in the habitats where the threatened species live, he said, for the same reason that the coal miner should be concerned that the canary is lying motionless on the bottom of the cage. Just as the canary is a sign of trouble with the air in the mine, the loss of species indicates impending problems for the health of the planet.\u201cPlant species make up ecosystems, and ecosystems provide services,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cThey do things for us.\u201d Those things, he said, include:When we lose species out of ecosystems, Greenwald pointed out, we start losing the services those ecosystems provide. \u201cThe functionality of ecosystems goes down,\u201d he said.Look to the bees for an example We are seeing this with the loss of bees, both native bees and the imported honeybees, Greenwald added. Bees are critical pollinators for farmers, and reduced numbers have caused alarm among almond growers in California. There\u2019s also concern over loss of bats in the Eastern United States and the role they play in insect control, Greenwald said.We should also remember, he continued, that species diversity is part of what makes different regions unique and special. The Georgia rockcress, he pointed out, is part of the history and natural heritage of some of the areas along the five rivers \u2014 the Chattahoochee, Coosa, Tombigee, Cahaba and Little Cahaba \u2014 where it grows in Georgia and Alabama. \u201cLosing species makes the world more and more the same, more homogenous,\u201d he said.It also causes scientists and researchers to lose information that form a knowledge base about the chemicals in plants and plant compounds. That\u2019s important, Greenwald said, because plants not only are a source of food but have played important roles as sources for medicines that help cure disease. He cited two examples.Quinine, the first effective treatment for malaria, occurs naturally in the bark of the cinchona tree. Cinchona quinine, a genus of 38 species native to the tropical Andes forests of western South America, was the anti-malarial drug of choice until the 1940s. Aspirin originally came from willow bark. Is it possible an extinct plant held the secret to a cure for cancer? Unfortunately, we\u2019ll never know.Pandas are cuddly, but plants stay put Do animals, like cute and cuddly baby panda bears, have an advantage over plants of achieving endangered status? Yes and no, says Greenwald.Precursors to the Endangered Species Act only allowed for the protection of vertebrate animals. With passage of the act in late 1973, plants and invertebrates were afforded protection. The result is that now many plants are protected. While it\u2019s true that plants aren\u2019t cuddly like a panda, Greenwald said, they also stay put. In that sense, they tend to generate less controversy than animals that move around and can turn up in inconvenient places.\u201cWe\u2019re fond of saying that plants are the foundation of life on Earth because they convert energy from the sun into food, so perhaps they are more important to protect than animals,\u201d he concluded. In either case, the center has been involved in petitioning for protection of species for more than 20 years in an attempt to protect the full suite of species at risk of extinction.The Endangered Species Act allows groups like the center as well as private citizens to petition to have species protected. It assigns response to the petitions and implementation of the act to the Fish and Wildlife Service.Fish and Wildlife's authority to stop projects The act prohibits the removal of species from the habitat. When a plant is protected under the act, the Fish and Wildlife Service immediately begins taking steps to restore the habitat or to propagate and to reintroduce the endangered species. If there is construction, logging or other activity in the area, the Fish and Wildlife Service has the authority to stop the activity in the portion of the project that has been designated as endangered, which may or may not be the entire project area.In 2011 the center and the Fish and Wildlife Service reached a settlement to speed protections for all the species on the endangered candidate waiting list as of 2010, as well as a host of other species previously petitioned for protection. So far, 108 species have been protected under the agreement and 61 more have been proposed for protection, including the Georgia rockcress.The Fish and Wildlife Service, however, depends on funding to buy endangered habitat, fund habitat restoration, pay for propagating new plants and a host of other activities, Greenwald said. Will Congress come through to make sure that plants facing the same endangered status as the Georgia rockcress get the funding they need so they, too, can once again thrive? Time will tell, but many scientists believe that time is running out."}, {"title": "Colorado Launches Official Website For Flood Recovery", "text": "The State of Colorado has launched an official website for those that want to help, as well as for victims of the devastating flooding that inundated the state last month.The website, called Colorado United, has the latest on road closures, tips for flood victims returning home on how to properly clear debris and sanitize their homes, water and food safety, nearby temporary housing, financial assistance and how to prepare for the coming winter as rebuilding continues.There is also information for anyone interested in helping the recovery effort through volunteering or donating.Colorado's historic flooding affected 24 counties across the state, resulted in the deaths of nine people and caused over $2 billion in property damage.Approximately 200 miles of state roads and more than 100 bridges were also damaged in the floods."}, {"title": "8 Historic Buildings That Are Environmentally Friendly", "text": "When it comes to environmental kudos, ultra-modern buildings usually steal the headlines.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Kenya Will Outfit Rhinos With Microchips In Attempt To Curb Poaching", "text": "Kenyan rhinos are about to get a high-tech upgrade.As part of an ongoing effort to curb poaching, authorities in Kenya plan to outfit every rhino in the country with a trackable microchip.

The vegetables filling the 1,500 square-foot plot are now rotting away on the vines and in the boxed beds, thanks to the mandate for \"minimal maintenance\" placed on the skeletal crew of National Park Service gardeners who remain on duty at 1600 Penn.According to the blog, groundskeepers \"have given up on their efforts to catch the elusive\" fox, said to be frequently seen at dawn and dusk.See also, squirrels:At The Atlantic, Garance Franke-Ruta details previous encounters between lawmakers and foxes:This isn't the first time a fox has invaded one of the three branches of the federal government. In 2002 a fox dashed into the U.S. Supreme Court on a Sunday, leading to a full-on fox hunt with \"two American foxhounds and a border terrier,\" as well as traps and animal-control specialists.

But we digress.)Readers: If you've seen the fox yourself, let us know about it. Better yet, send us a photo.Meantime, we've had no word about what will happen to the fox, or the other wild new residents of the White House grounds, once the shutdown ends. We'd imagine that some animal-lovers will petition the White House, asking that the fox be granted clemency -- but, of course, the White House's We The People portal for making such requests is offline at the moment.Now here's a photo of a fox at the Capitol, apparently pre-dating the shutdown:And this is what the fox says/what's going to be stuck in your head all day long:UPDATE, Oct. 17, 8:45 a.m.: The shutdown is over!

The lone vote against the bill came from Councilman Mel Rapozo, who said the measure unfairly targets biotech companies and sets the county up for lawsuits.The law is set to take effect in nine months \u2014 with or without the mayor\u2019s signature, because bills receiving five or more votes are veto-proof.The hearing, which began at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, lasted nearly 19 hours. As the deliberations stretched on, council members grew tired and cranky, and the audience became raucous enough that Council Chair Jay Furfaro threatened to evict members of the audience if they didn't settle down following the testimony of Mayor Bernard Carvalho.But the excitement of Kauai residents was clear well before the hearing even began. Some camped out overnight on the lawn in front of the Kauai County Building to make sure they would have a seat in the small, upstairs hearing room.Supporters of the bill erupted in celebration of the vote, which came at 3:35 a.m., following the culmination of a hearing in which about 100 people argued for one side or the other. Cheers echoed inside the hearing room, while others could be heard on the front lawn where the public had remained around loudspeakers to listen to deliberations.\"To the seed companies, I want to make sure you understand that we have to envision the future for our island,\" said Council Chair Jay Furfaro minutes before the vote. \"Your companies have your policies. But we need to envision Kauai in the future and this is a start for us.\"The bill affects the heaviest users of restricted use pesticides, including the four biotech companies that operate on the island: Syngenta, DuPont-Pioneer, Dow and BASF, as well as Kauai Coffee Co.The law will force those companies to disclose what pesticides they are using, where and in what quantities. It sets up buffer zones between fields sprayed with pesticides and public areas, including schools, waterways, parks and hospitals, and requires companies to notify the public before they spray. The county will also be obliged to conduct health and environmental studies to asses the potential effects of pesticide use. All farmers will have to publicly disclose any genetically engineered crops that they grow.The bill passed over the objections of Mayor Bernard Carvalho after the council rebuffed his suggestion that it delay voting on the measure for one month so that he could finish working out a deal between state officials and the biotech companies that would lessen the county\u2019s financial and logistical burdens in enforcing the bill.At 3:00 a.m., Councilwoman Nadine Nakamura, who was recently appointed managing director for the mayor, appeared as if she was going to make a motion to delay the vote. \"I'm proposing this just because I know in a few weeks I am going to have to be involved in implementing this law,\" she said. Nakamura expressed concerns that the bill would be too hard to implement and be a magnet for lawsuits.But she was sharply rebuked by other councilmembers. Councilman Gary Hooser, who co-introduced the bill with Tim Bynum, said he was \"flabbergasted to put it mildly.\"Bynum choked up with emotion even as the anger of supporters of the legislation erupted into screams of \"Pass the Bill!\"\u201cUntil you resign, your responsibility is to the people of Kauai,\" Bynum said, \"and for you to say that next week that you have to work for the mayor and will have to implement this is highly impartial and unethical.\"Council Chair Furfaro stood up to try to calm the unrest.The motion for a delay was never put up for a vote and Nakamura ultimately voted in favor of the bill.Carvalho, who sat through the entire hearing, expressed concerns that Kauai does not have sufficient personnel or funding to properly implement the bill. The mayor\u2019s office estimates that it will need to come up with $1.3 million by the middle of next year to fund various measures in the bill.While the state has come under fire from county council members for lax oversight of pesticides, Carvalho told council members Tuesday that he had assurances from the state that it would improve.Last month, the governor issued a statement to say that he would work toward the creation of voluntarily pesticide disclosure guidelines and buffer zones that the biotech companies would agree to comply with. Carvalho said at the hearing that he received assurance this week from Russell Kokubun, chair of the state Department of Agriculture, that the state would implement the new guidelines by the end of October.\u201cI believe this is going to be a model for the whole world to see,\u201d Carvalho said in his effort to persuade the county council. \u201cAnd I would hope that this model would be to work it out and bring people together.\u201dBut council members remained skeptical about the state\u2019s commitment to expanding and enforcing pesticide regulation, and they questioned the biotech industry\u2019s willingness to compromise, given its staunch opposition to the bill.\u201cFrankly, everyone else is a little bit late to the dance,\u201d said Hooser. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for months. The governor shows up three weeks ago and Kokubun shows up ten days ago.\u201dCritics accused the governor and state officials of intervening late in an effort to derail the bill.Conversely, biotech companies argue that they are being unfairly targeted and that there is no substantive scientific basis for what they see as the council's legislative attack on their work. They also expressed concerns that if Kauai passed the bill, it could lead other counties, states or nations to follow suit.Attorneys for the biotech companies said during the hearings that aspects of the bill are \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d or amount to an \u201cillegal taking\u201d of property.Council members said that they expect biotech companies to file lawsuits in response to the bill's passage.(Small farmers are exempt from the bill\u2019s pesticide provisions.)Earlier this month, nine local attorneys, including prominent environmental lawyers, released a statement urging council members not to bow to pressure from the biotech companies.\"We believe that Bill 2491 is sound, and the mere threat of a lawsuit by industry interests should not prevent the council from taking action they believe is important to their community,\" the statement read.An attorney for Kauai provided the county council with a 66-page brief outlining his view of the bill\u2019s legality. Council members voted 5-2 on Tuesday to keep that document confidential, noting that it could undermine the county's arguments if Bill 2491 ends up in court."}, {"title": "What An Orangutan Says To This Little Girl Is A Message We All Need To Know About", "text": "However, this particular conversation is way more important than it is cute.Read more on www.upworthy.com"}, {"title": "Finding Urban 'Tethers' in City Places", "text": "In London's Russell Square one recent morning, I saw the human-scale \"tether\" illustrated above.

In the wide-open Place Saint-Nicolas, two boys, seemingly alone, consulted without fear.Unlike the Russell Square example, the physical distance between parent and child in Bastia seemed surprisingly trusting, fully immersed in the surrounding urban environment.In the tradition of the open square, \"eyes on the street\" were everywhere in Bastia. If Russell Square was a path across green, then Place Saint-Nicolas was stage without curtain.The inset in the photo above (as well as the larger photo below) show aerial views of the square, with arrows depicting viewpoints of parents who elected the more permissive, visual \"tether\" on that late summer day.Notably, the flanking caf\u00e9s along Boulevard du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle enhanced this captive, stage effect.

It's pretty apt for what this government paroxysm is doing to science all over the world. Take stalled scientific expeditions to Antarctica, where expensive instruments tuned to the pulses of melting ice caps stand in danger of going unmonitored this year. This doesn't represent just the waste of hundreds of hours of preparation and analysis. If the instruments aren't repaired and tended to this year, they are likely to be lost in the snowy depths and rendered useless. Because the research is federally funded, it's on ice, as it were.In Point Reyes, Calif., researchers from world-renowned Point Blue Conservation Science are caught at an ornithological impasse. Formerly known as the Point Reyes Bird Observatory, this organization has been collecting data on songbirds since 1966. That's 46 years of how many of which species are tweeting when and where, how well they are reproducing and how well they are surviving. In the world of natural science, long data sets are extremely rare. Until relatively recently, even if researchers had the ambition to collect the painstaking records that reveal the life histories of species, they weren't able to easily collect it. Mobile technology, sophisticated statistical programming, and massive computing power have put Big Data at center stage in biodiversity studies.Point Blue has been at the forefront of this revolution and this year is the second they have deployed sophisticated miniature geolocator tabs to track birds that pass through Point Reyes. \"It's pretty much changed our lives,\" says Tom Gardali of Point Blue's Palomarin Field Station. \"Before the geolocators, we didn't really know where the birds went. Now we do.\" Monitoring Swainson's thrushes, Gardali and his team have discovered that after wintering here they go to western Mexico near Puerta Vallarta (of course they do). \"This is incredibly important to conservation,\" he explains. \"Now we know that this landscape is connected to that landscape.\"On the other hand, Golden Crowned sparrows that find Point Reyes to be their idea of a winter vacation go to Alaska to breed. \"The amazing thing is that they spread out rather drastically,\" Gardali says, the wonder of it all evident in his voice. \"They break up and go to different spots along a 1300-km stretch of Alaskan coast. That ties our little West Marin place here with a vast geography.\" Most of the shore line of North America is connected through these birds, conjoined at the special locus of Point Reyes.The birds are following an ancient schedule that operates regardless of the bullies holding fast to their pulpit. Because Point Reyes is a National Seashore, Gardali and his team are forbidden from counting up the Crowned sparrows that are currently migrating here. If they fly through without being noted, the expense in both time and dollars of the fancy geolocators will be wasted. The loss of this year's data degrades the effort and achievement of the 46 years of data that come before it. The utility of long-term monitoring is that it shows change happening at the scale at which it occurs -- at a huge scale over many years and many miles. Take an arbitrary bite out of that and you thwack the big picture.As if the insult to the vital increase of basic knowledge weren't enough, consider the repercussions of the shutdown on volunteers. Not only are the government researchers prevented from doing their work, so are scores of volunteers who help them do it. The Gulf of the Farallones Marine Sanctuary has for 20 years run a Beach Watch monitoring program. Since 1993 more than 100 highly trained citizen scientists have helped notify the Office of Spill Prevention and Response about signs that an oil pollution event is underway. Beach Watch volunteers undergo a rigorous 80-hour training before being assigned one of 41 beach segments in the Bay Area to inventory every two to four weeks, taking meticulous note of both live and dead birds and mammals, and documenting oil tarballs. Beach Watch volunteers are amazingly dedicated and consistent. This January, assuming we have a functioning government, 15 Beach Watch veterans who have been on the job for 20 years each will be honored by the Sanctuary.Although they don't get paid, Beach Watch volunteers are covered by worker's compensation insurance provided by the federal government -- and of course, that is suspended at the moment. Volunteers have been enjoined to not go out to monitor transects. What this means is that 20 years of consistent data on the state and health of our beaches -- which reflect the status of seabirds and marine mammals -- will have a big lacuna in it. This could have a negative impact on future litigation and settlements regarding oil spills and the damage they do to our wildlife, to the health of our ecosystems, to our commercial and recreational experiences on the shore.The shutdown of Beach Watch also comes at the time of year known informally as \"oil spill season.\" Annual current changes bring tarballs from naturally occurring oil seeps along the shores of central and southern California up North. Winter storms jar the sunken ships that liberally populate our sea floor- - many of these went down with fuel aboard. And of course, there's the stormy challenge to the constant shipping traffic through San Francisco Bay. It's not if there will be another oil event here, it's when. But without Beach Watch volunteers monitoring the shores for signs of stressed wildlife and tarballs, knowledge of these events will be delayed, and so will the subsequent response.Timing is everything in nature, and the monitoring of sea life is particularly important now, at the end of the breeding season. A high level of bird mortality this time of year reflects the huge effort it takes older birds to fledge the next generation. Young birds that don't make it through the ultimate hazing of survival, the challenges faced by their species for millennia, also die in higher numbers this time of year. The least we owe these sojourners is to witness and note the termination of their existence, intimately tied with our own. And without full information documented in standardized surveys, we can't know whether the dead birds on the beach are part of the average fall-out in the struggle for existence, or if they indicate a larger pollution or other human-caused event.Citizen scientists in general don't have PhDs. What they do have is the status, the responsibilities, and the rights that define members of our body politic. The government shutdown perversely prevents people from fulfilling their roles as citizens. It voids the heroic commitment of regular people who devote thousands upon thousands of hours each year to helping safeguard our natural capital. It erases critical links in irreplaceable data sets going back into time. Stanley Kubrick was trying to get at a lie of the mind Homo sapiens are all too good at telling. Self-interest occludes what is right, even what is desperately, vitally right. We wring our hands; the birds fly overhead.

Food, for instance, appears on the shelves of our stores, keeping them fully stocked. Runs on Walmart stores due to a computer glitch or interruptions by major storms aside, we expect the food we eat to both be there the next day, the next week, and the next month, and be sustainable as well.But what if it's not sustainable? What if today's food production can't keep up with global population growth?Mechanized farming has carried society into this century regarding food production. Today, GPS spatial-technology and big data analytics are now optimizing farming even further, but with genetically engineered crops and the overuse of fertilizers and chemicals to fight pests and disease there has been a backlash.Yet none of the above tools represent a quantum leap in food production. Outbreaks of disease sprout up periodically, while farming runoff has created oxygen-depleted dead zones around coastal deltas, and over-farming has stripped nutrients out of the soil.A quantum leap in food production, while keeping the soil nutrient-rich, will be critical to our future survival, as the global population will grow to 9 billion by 2050 and perhaps 12 billion by 2100. A 2008 Pew Study estimates the U.S. residential population will explode from 330 million today to 438 million by middle of this century. With more than 50 percent of the world's population living in urban cities -- we crossed that threshold last year -- expected to surge to 75 percent in the next generation, where will the next sea change come from?Can technology development in our space program contribute to the answer?The zero gravity (aka microgravity) environment of the International Space Station now seems to hold some of those answers in low earth orbit.The solution is right out of a sci-fi novel. And yet it's not. Add a sprinkling of Darwin at the speed of light and we take a major step closer understanding this quantum change.Accelerating Gene Evolution in Zero GravityThe concept of Zero Gravity Solutions, Inc., discovered on NASA missions to the space station, is about taking seeds of plants and cultures petri dishes, put them in zero gravity, stress them under the polar opposite environment that they are used to -- a tropical plant on earth in a cold climate in space -- and watch Darwin's theory on evolution take root at blinding speed.Genes that have long been dormant for tens of millions of years, suddenly, when stressed in a zero gravity environment, awaken nature's 'survival of the fittest.'By awakening dozens of dormant genes in fruit, plant, vegetable, and cultured cells, Zero Gravity Solutions' technology accelerates gene expression in evolution at warp speed. In short, they are leveraging Darwin's process of natural selection. Once those latent genes have revealed themselves, they are brought back down to earth, literally, planted in the soil and grow in ways that their earth-bound counterparts could only dream of.[Vitro cultures of Jatroph, Credit: Dr. Wagner Vendrame, University of Florida]Bananas are under the threat of extinction. Can corn yields keep up with population growth that is a mere generation away from testing our capacity to provide?

The co-sponsored conference, with Livingston Securities partnering with Invest in Bavaria, is the brainchild of Scott Livingston, a New York premier financier of cleantech, Nanotech, and biotech startups and emerging companies.After hearing their pitch to investors, I caught up with Godwin and Kaye, and asked them what model they developed.\"We are using a 'Silk Road' model,\" Richard Godwin said. \"We really can't manufacture a car in space and bring it down to earth. So like the Silk Road, which used caravans to transport spices that greatly enhanced foods, we can take a cylinder of seeds or cultures and fly them up to the International Space Station and have nature modify those genes in zero gravity.\"The personable and scientific Godwin paused, and added, \"With private space flight there are now eighteen trips up to the space station and eighteen trips down each year.\"Harvey Kaye, who was retired (short-lived) from years of working in the executive suite at environmental and bio-waste companies, as well as banking and capital markets, flashed a broad smile. But it was the sparkle in his eyes that belied his age. He had the look of a young entrepreneur. But the Silk Road model needed a business model on how to commercialize the technology. That is where Mr. Kaye came into the venture.\"Coming from a background with companies related to the environment, I had a deep understanding of the problems we are going to face this century,\" Kaye said. \"From a banker's perspective we had to create a business out of it with return on investment. I call it a businessman's perspective. It took me five to six months to develop a reoccurring revenue model that would make Zero Gravity profitable, while continue doing additional research as industry multinationals fund product development in return for licensing the patents.\"Then Kaye added, \"The days of ten years of research are over. We needed to build off the business model and execute a revenue plan that will change agriculture, as we know it for the better. When the planet reaches nine billion people, the threats to our food supply and the decline of resources will be that much more pronounced.\"I turned to Richard Godwin, and asked, \"When did the light turn on for you that there was a potentially big commercial value for the Zero Gravity Solutions?\"When I was introduced to John Wayne Kennedy by Gwynne Shotwell, while working on DragonLab,\" Mr. Godwin said.DragonLab is the lab within the International Space Station that hovers in low earth orbit in zero gravity.[DragonLab at International Space Station, Credit: NASA]\"What other potential uses might there be for zero gravity products beyond food?\" I asked.\"Human regenerative developments, protein crystal for the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said, noting Schering Plough developed a new Hepatitis-C vaccine on the Columbia Shuttle. \"Then there are new materials science and new alloys, such as nitrogen-foamed titanium. Or mixing oil and water type alloys, with one that doesn't float to the top. And there are combustion technologies (more efficient) and new vaccines being developed in microgravity by Arizona State University, and using crystallography to learn what osteoporosis is.\"From Harvey Kaye's blog, How do We Feed 9 Billion People, he and Richard Godwin believe their company, which has acquired a half dozen space lab patents derived from six NASA-enabled missions to space stations, is \"seeking answers to humanity's greatest threat to survival.\"That includes depletion of micronutrients in the soil; the impact on the use of chemical fertilizers, creating water pollution and dead zones; the destruction of the microorganisms and microbacteria in the soil; as well as the decline in the nutritional value of crops that are becoming more susceptible to disease.From Kaye's blog:\"Zero Gravity Solutions' Chief Science Officer and Founder, John Wayne Kennedy, has been aware of these issues and has utilized his more than 40 years of experience at the USDA and his work with NASA/ISS Space Programs to develop certain proprietary technologies that hold the potential to create significantly more nutritious food which is expected to be disease-resistant, without the use of chemicals and is non-GMO.\"To this author, their technology is amazing in that I have longed gazed at the stars and other planets for answers, while some nations today are looking at the asteroid and comet belts in our solar systems to mine them of resources, when perhaps the answer to our sustainability problems might reside in low earth orbit.If that's the case, there will be more flights to the International Space Station."}, {"title": "Rob The Baby Palm Squirrel Sleeps All Day...

But the greatest bounty he discovered was actually fish. Smith and his crew stumbled upon vast schools of cod, a valuable commercial fish and a kitchen staple in Europe. Dried or salted, the nourishment from North America's rich seas paved the way for colonization of a vast new continent.Inevitably, these deep-water fish became an economic centerpiece of the New World. Cities like Boston transformed from basic settlements into thriving cities by trading cod for European goods and Caribbean sugar. But in the 1600s the world was a much less crowded place. Today, with the human population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, we have many more hungry mouths to feed. But like Smith, we sit on the edge of a potentially vast resource for fighting hunger: fish.In the late 1980s -- more than 350 years after Smith boasted of endless bounty -- the Atlantic cod fishery collapsed. In a now-familiar story, overfishing, habitat destruction, and bycatch combined to decimate the once-robust cod schools. Tens of thousands of fishermen were out of work, and an affordable culinary staple since the 1600s all but disappeared from kitchens.Unfortunately, we still haven't learned our lesson. We move from one species to another, ruthlessly fishing until all our hooks come up empty. When fisheries collapse, something more is lost besides one species in a sea of others. We lose an opportunity to feed needy people a source of healthy, wild protein.No one wants to see seafood disappear from our dinner plates as fisheries collapse. But others won't survive these losses: 1 billion of the world's poorest people rely on seafood as their main source of animal protein. Until now, we've fed our increasingly crowded world by clearing more forest, planting more crops, and dumping more water and more fertilizer on the fields. But this cycle can't continue.Thankfully, we have a rare opportunity to feed millions of people and restore the abundant oceans that John Smith encountered centuries ago. It's not a radical idea, but one backed by sound science and experience. Fish stocks can and will bounce back -- if we let them.The formula is simple: set science-backed quotas, reduce bycatch, and protect habitats that foster marine life. It won't be as hard as you might think. Just 25 countries control 76 percent of the world's coastal oceans, and a mere 10 countries control 51 percent. We don't need an international treaty to resuscitate our oceans -- we just need to convince these key governments to better manage their fisheries.This year, World Food Day is centered around sustainable food systems and their contribution to food security and nutrition. Healthier oceans are the key to strengthening worldwide food security and providing healthy protein to hungry people. According to a recent study in Science, the oceans could yield up to 40 percent more seafood if the world's fisheries are better managed. That means our oceans could feed 700 million people a healthy, wild seafood meal every day, forever. By saving the oceans we can feed the world."}, {"title": "Breathtaking Tribute To A Fallen Farmer", "text": "Recently, we got the most amazing note, from a photographer named Matt Rubel, with a link to some pictures from an unusual memorial to a young farmer in Illinois.

It offers the opportunity to strengthen national and international solidarity in the fight to end hunger, malnutrition and poverty. With falling water tables, eroding soils and rising temperatures making it difficult to feed growing populations, control of arable land and water resources is moving to center stage in the global struggle for food security. Here are some facts to consider:Ensuring adequate food supplies was once a rather simple matter, the sole responsibility of the ministry of agriculture. When governments wanted to accelerate growth in the grain harvest, they simply raised the support price paid to farmers. Now that is changing. Securing future food supplies has become incredibly complex. It may now depend more on policies in the ministry of health and family planning or of energy than in the ministry of agriculture itself.Today, the growth in world grain consumption is concentrated in China. It is adding over eight million people per year, but the big driver is the rising affluence of its nearly 1.4 billion people. As incomes go up, people tend to eat more meat. China's meat consumption per person is still only half that of the United States, leaving a huge potential for future demand growth.Aquifer depletion now threatens harvests in the big three grain producers -- China, India and the United States -- that together produce half of the world's grain. The question is not whether water shortages will affect future harvests in these countries, but rather when they will do so.The world is in transition from an era dominated by surpluses to one defined by scarcity. Not eating at all on some days is how the world's poorest are coping with the doubling of world grain prices since 2006. But even as we face new constraints on future production, the world population is growing by 80 million people each year.During the last half of the 20th century, the world's irrigated area expanded from some 250 million acres in 1950 to roughly 700 million in 2000. This near tripling of world irrigation within 50 years was historically unique. Since then the growth in irrigation has come to a near standstill, expanding only 10 percent between 2000 and 2010.Future food production is also threatened by soil erosion. The thin layer of topsoil that covers the earth's land surface was formed over long stretches of geological time as new soil formation exceeded the natural rate of erosion. Sometime within the last century, the situation was reversed as soil erosion began to exceed new soil formation. Now, nearly a third of the world's cropland is losing topsoil faster than new soil is forming, reducing the land's inherent fertility. Soil that was formed on a geological time scale is being lost on a human time scale. Peak soil is now history.In addition to wells going dry and soils eroding, both at an unprecedented pace, the generation of farmers now on the land is the first to face manmade climate change. Agriculture as it exists today developed over 11,000 years of rather remarkable climate stability. It has evolved to maximize production within that climate system. Now, suddenly, the climate is changing. With each passing year, the agricultural system is more and more out of sync with the climate system.Mountain glaciers are melting in the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, and elsewhere, but nowhere does melting threaten world food security more than in the glaciers of the Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau that feed the major rivers of India and China. Ice melt helps sustain these rivers during the dry season. In the Indus, Ganges, Yellow, and Yangtze river basins, where irrigated agriculture depends heavily on rivers, the loss of glacial-fed, dry-season flow will shrink harvests and could create potentially unmanageable food shortages.In Japan, the longtime leader in raising cropland productivity, the rise in the yield of rice that began in the 1880s essentially came to a halt in 1996. Having maximized productivity, farmers ran into the inherent limits of photosynthesis and could no longer increase the amount they could harvest from a given plot. In China, rice yields are now just 4 percent below Japan's. Unless China can raise its yields above those in Japan, which seems unlikely, it, too, is facing a plateauing of rice yields. Yields of wheat, the world's other food staple, are also plateauing in the more agriculturally advanced countries. For example, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom --Europe's leading wheat producers--had been raising wheat yields for several decades, but roughly a decade ago, all three hit plateaus. Corn yields in the United States, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world corn harvest, are starting to level off. Yields in some other corn-growing countries such as Argentina, France, and Italy also appear to be stagnating.What makes Lester Brown an expert on the global food situation?

They want pregnant cows and heifers of breeding age, said a group organizing donations on Tuesday.Twenty cattlemen so far have pledged cows to help replenish western South Dakota herds devastated in the Oct. 3-5 storm, said Montana rancher Kerry White, head of Citizens for Balanced Use, which promotes grazing leases on federal lands.More than 6,100 cattle have been reported dead from the storm that may have claimed up to 30,000 head at a time when they had not yet developed protective winter coats, said South Dakota state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven.Some parts of South Dakota were pummeled by up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of snow after freezing rain and wind gusts up to 70 miles per hour (112 km per hour).Cows and calves grazing in vast, open grasslands succumbed to hypothermia, suffocated in massive snowdrifts or died from exhaustion trying to outrun the weather, Oedekoven said.The storm delivered crippling blows to ranchers who have spent decades building bloodlines and selecting for certain behavioral traits in cow-calf pairs, said Silvia Christen, executive director of the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association.\"Families are traumatized. These animals depended on them and they couldn't help,\" Christen said.White said his group is seeking pregnant cows or heifers from Montana, Idaho and Wyoming to jumpstart South Dakota production. The group is seeking 10,000 head to start shipping in December.\"We're not trying to replace the herds. We're trying to rebuild them,\" White said.It will take weeks to determine the livestock death toll from the storm. Some ranches are still without power and snowdrifts and recent rains have made many remote pastures inaccessible.South Dakota in January had 3.85 million head of cattle, the sixth-largest herd in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The planned donations of breeding stock would shorten the time that hard-hit South Dakota cattle producers are without calves. Cows in colder climates are generally bred once a year and their calving is timed for early spring to coincide with moderating weather and available natural forage.Alysa Robbins, outreach manager for the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association, applauded the Montana cattle drive but said some decimated operations may not be ready to receive animals until spring.\"Producers are in shock. They're still trying to find and take care of animals that survived the ordeal. It's hard to plan too far ahead when people are trying to get by hour by hour,\" Robbins said.

The justices let stand the foundational element of the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations -- the scientific finding that these gases \"endanger\" public health -- as well as the agency's ambitious controls on trucks and automobiles.The Supreme Court will review EPA's treatment of a relatively arcane question concerning the permitting requirements for certain new pollution sources. But contrary to some reports, this is not a general review of EPA's climate regulation. In fact, no matter how the Supreme Court decides the issue that it has taken up, it will not compromise the main thrust of the president's climate action plan.As the president announced in that summer speech, EPA is implementing a comprehensive program to control such emissions from stationary sources. In this connection, last month, EPA proposed rules for new power plants -- a major source of greenhouse gases. Early next year, it plans to propose similar rules for existing sources.With today's decision not to review the central tenets of EPA's authority, the agency can now proceed with its rules to decrease the flow of heat-trapping emissions from the smoke stacks of our nation's plants and factories as well as those from our cars, trucks, and airplanes.The Supreme Court's review announced today concerns different legal provisions in the Clean Air Act than the one EPA is focused on for its upcoming rules. Those rules will be issued under section 111, which provides EPA the authority to regulate \"air pollution\" that \"endanger[s] public health or welfare.\" In 2007, in the landmark case of Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court upheld EPA's determination that greenhouse gases are \"air pollutants\" for the purposes of the Clean Air Act.Today, the Supreme Court declined to review EPA's determination that greenhouse gases \"endanger public health.\" So, EPA now as a green light to continue moving forward with its regulatory program. On this central point, the challengers have come to the end of the road and EPA's regulatory program is the law of the land.Rather than allowing further litigation over broad questions concerning EPA's ability to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of stationary and mobile sources, as industry groups asked it to do, the Court agreed to review only one narrow issue involving the question of whether certain facilities that emit greenhouse gases need to get a permit under the Clean Air Act's Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program.Once the rules on stationary sources announced by the president are in place, that issue -- even if the Supreme Court rules against EPA -- will have only a trivial impact on EPA's climate change program. Thus, the question taken by the Supreme Court will have very limited real world consequences on greenhouse gas emissions.Those who interpret the Supreme Court's consideration of this narrow element to mean that the administrations planned greenhouse gas regulations cannot move forward are simply wrong. This decision raises no plausible question about EPA's authority to do so. Quite to the contrary, the agency has now overcome the last remaining hurdle -- the upholding of the endangerment finding -- on its way to robustly regulated greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act."}, {"title": "San Francisco Apartment Complex Includes Butterfly Habitat Because Of Course It Does", "text": "Oh, San Francisco.

When most of us buy a car, we adopt a lifestyle of dependency. We depend on income to pay for the car payments. We depend on insurance companies to likely rip us off as insured members. We depend on foreign oil from far away lands (some unfriendly) to feed the metal beasts we drive. Is that still a pleasure you think?But what if we only need a car every other day, or only on weekends, or only twice a month? Wouldn't it make sense then to rent one? No more parking or storage problems when the car is not in use. No more high insurance premiums and best of all, no more car payments!Some companies rent cars for as little as $18 a day. So let's say you only want a car on Saturdays to do your weekly shopping; then have a car for a day for about $20 and then be done with it. If you are a college student and only need a car one weekend each month to visit your family, rent a car for 2 days for less than $50. If your city is not equipped with enough transportation, a lot of the rental cars companies will pick you up at home when you need to get a car. And drop you off when you're done.And really if you are a college student living on campus, when do you ever need a car? Most campuses offer free shuttles to shopping malls and medical centers, so students won't need to have a car at all. That is a wise decision in my opinion.When I lived in New York, I never drove in the city. Subway, buses and taxis were my modes of transportation. We would rent a car for weekends upstate or to the beach. And we just shopped for food less, much less. We had small daily purchases instead of massive weekend refills of carts and carts of food.If you have loads of kids, dogs, and/or live in the country or a small town, then a car is probably necessary, but half of Americans live in or near a big city, so it would be a green eco-friendly thing to do, probably healthy for some egos as well, to stop wanting your own car. And besides, you can use a different model each time you rent, how cool is that?Another new option to get a car from time to time: a new company called Zipcar claims to be the alternative to owning, or even renting a car. The concept here is to buy a Zipcard which will then unlock a car full of gas and fully insured 24/7 in all the locations where the company has vehicles, for as little as $7.75 an hour; 180 miles are included in the basic deal, but you can add mileage without breaking the bank. The service is available in about two dozen American cities so far, plus 300 campus locations, as well as in Canada, England, Austria, and Spain. This is a similar concept as the bikes rentals docked in big cities such as New York or Paris.If everybody on the planet would behave a little more sensibly, we can fix our cars' problem, lower pollution and traffic jams, save money on insurance, free ourselves of worldly possessions.

Apparently oil spills are also kicking up a bit of a kerfuffle in North Dakota.In August, TheGreenGrok called attention to the fact that oil spills are probably more common than you might think and may be a lot closer to home than you would want. That fact was brought home for Steve Jensen who on September 29 discovered a pipeline leak in the middle of his wheat fields.While the pipeline, which is owned by San Antonio, Texas-based Tesoro Logistics, is only six inches in diameter, the spill covered a whopping 7.3 acres -- an area equivalent to about seven football fields. How did such a small line manage to cover such a large area? Probably because no one was checking. In fact, Jensen reported that he had smelled fumes for days before he discovered it. It took even longer for the spill to be made public, perhaps because the state is not obligated to inform the public of an oil spill. North Dakota's lawmakers are questioning the response time, and the state is looking into its spill-reporting procedures.Who's in ChargeThe safety of the nation's 2.5 million miles of pipeline falls under the aegis of the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration through its Office of Pipeline Safety.In principle, the Office of Pipeline Safety together with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (for intrastate pipelines) handles inspection and enforcement of pipeline safety regulations in the state. But there is concern that there are just not enough inspectors to handle the increased production from the current boom. The Office of Pipeline Safety has about 100 inspectors nationwide for the country's vast network of pipelines and only 1.5 full-time employees to review the 450 emergency response plans for 450 facilities nationwide [pdf]. Add in the partial government shutdown, and you have to wonder -- I bet Jensen is wondering -- who on earth is minding the pipeline store. Course, considering the numbers, even when the government is open for business, these inspectors may be spread just a wee bit too thin. Then again, North Dakota's pipelines carry less than half of the crude (see also here) produced in the state.Minimum Damage? Maybe. But an Uptick in Spillage.Fortunately, the oil does not seem to have reached the water table. Unfortunately for Jensen, the field will be unusable for several years.Still, the spill will significantly boost this year's tally for pipeline spills, which as of mid-September was close to 2.3 million gallons -- an almost 20 percent increase over 2012's total.To keep this crude post short and sweet, let's let some photos of the spill (also here) wrap things up.Keep up with TheGreenGrok | Like us on Facebook"}, {"title": "'Green News Report' - October 15, 2013", "text": "TWITTER: @GreenNewsReport FACEBOOK: Green News Report The 'GNR' is also now available on your cell phone via Stitcher Radio's mobile app!IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: Breaking: U.S. Supreme Court to hear challenge to EPA greenhouse gas emission regulations; India dodges a bullet with Super Cyclone Phailin, while Fukushima prepares for another; 800,000+ gallon oil spill in ND; Government shutdown shuts down US Antarctic research program; PLUS: Glimpse the future with the latest winners in solar cars and solar houses ...

And Then Nothing Happened", "text": "ProPublica's Theodoric Meyer reports:Congress did something unusual last year. It passed a bill that acknowledged that sea levels are rising \u2014 i.e., that climate change is happening.The measure in question, buried near the end of a 584-page transportation funding bill, also required some modest action: That the Federal Emergency Management Agency use \u201cthe best available climate science\u201d to figure out how the flood insurance program it administers should handle rising seas.FEMA\u2019s first step was supposed to be to set up an advisory body, the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, that would make recommendations on how the agency could take the effects of climate change into account in its flood insurance maps.But more than a year later, FEMA hasn\u2019t named a single member to the council. Without any members, it has been unable to meet or make any recommendations. In July, the council missed a deadline set out in the law for submitting written recommendations for how the flood insurance program might deal with future risks related to climate change.FEMA had developed a charter for the council by the end of August and was in the process of finalizing letters to solicit council members, according to the agency. Dan Watson, the FEMA press secretary, said he was unable to provide more up-to-date information because much of the agency\u2019s staff has been furloughed under the government shutdown.Few areas of the federal government are more directly affected by climate change than the flood insurance program and its maps, which determine the premiums that 5.6 million American households pay for flood insurance. The program fell deeply into the red after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy last year. It\u2019s currently $25 billion in debt.Many of the maps are decades out of date and therefore don\u2019t reflect the rise in sea levels since the time they were drawn.FEMA released a report in June estimating that sea levels will rise an average of four feet by 2100, increasing the portion of the country at high risk of flooding by up to 45 percent. The number of Americans who live in those areas could double by the century\u2019s end, according to the report.The law requires the council to outline steps for improving the \u201caccuracy, general quality, ease of use, and distribution and dissemination\u201d of the maps. Josh Saks, legislative director for the National Wildlife Federation, which pushed for the legislation, said that might include figuring out how to better take into account the way new development along a river, say, worsens flooding for those who live downstream.Jimi Grande, the senior vice president for federal and political affairs for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, a lobbying group, said the council would \u201cabsolutely\u201d help make the flood maps more accurate.\u201cWe need to know what the risks are to have an intelligent conversation as a country\u201d about development in areas that are vulnerable to flooding, he said.The measure was part of a broader package of reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program that phased out many of the government subsidies that had kept flood insurance premiums artificially cheap for many homeowners. The full-risk rates phased in for many policyholders on Oct. 1, despite vocal protests against them.An operational mapping advisory council wouldn\u2019t fix everything that\u2019s wrong with the flood insurance program. As ProPublica has reported, some of the maps FEMA has issued in recent years have been based on outdated, inaccurate data, giving homeowners a misleading impression of flood risk and, in some cases, forcing them to buy insurance when they were not at great risk of flooding.Taking climate change into account when setting flood insurance rates is also a complex task.\u201cThat\u2019s why we put the council in charge,\u201d said Saks, from the National Wildlife Federation. \u201cI can read the science and say storms are happening more often, and I can read the numbers and see that sea-level rise is happening. But I\u2019m not an actuary, and I don\u2019t know how you then translate that to\u201d setting insurance rates.The risk-modeling companies that private insurers rely on have struggled to take climate change into account in their models, but they are making progress.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if within the next five years we could credibly start to incorporate climate change into aspects of the modeling,\u201d said David F. Smith, the vice president of the model development group at Eqecat, a risk-modeling firm.Michael B. Gerrard, director of the Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said he wasn\u2019t surprised FEMA had been slow in setting up the council.\u201cIt\u2019s the rule, rather than the exception, that federal agencies miss the rule-making deadlines\u201d set out in laws, he said. \u201cOften they have to be sued to get back on schedule.\u201d"}, {"title": "Stop What You're Doing And Watch This Sloth Sing Whitney Houston", "text": "Drop whatever you're doing and check out this sleepy baby sloth.We know he's just yawning, but in our hearts we truly want to believe he's singing along to Whitney Houston's classic version of \"I Will Always Love You.\"The real credit here belongs to Twitter user @MatthewPaquette, who made the video and shared it on Vine:"}, {"title": "Elephant 'Eats' Bridesmaid On Wedding Day In Hilarious Video", "text": "Even though it wasn't her big day, a bridesmaid got a big surprise from an elephant at a wedding in Thailand.The adorable (and undoubtedly surprising) moment went down at a wedding on the island of Phuket on Sunday, according to News.com.au.

However, the measure, which would have mandated labeling of foods containing genetically engineered ingredients, garnered more than 6 million votes, and was actually a great case of \"losing forward.\" Despite outspending of nearly 5 to 1, the initiative lost by just 2 percentage points and attracted a significant amount of national media attention.Inspired by California's effort, nearly 40 states are now working on mandatory labeling of GMOs (genetically modified organisms). In June, Connecticut and Maine became the first states to pass mandatory GMO labeling -- though in both cases additional states need to pass similar measures in order for the laws to take effect.This November, voters in Washington State will have a chance to pass I-522, a similar but improved version of the Prop 37 legislation. Since January, organizers in California have been sharing lessons learned with their peers in Washington, giving I-522 a solid foundation for success. As a state with an economy focused on exports--a lot of which go to countries with GMO bans--Washington is uniquely concerned about GMO contamination. With the looming threat of genetically engineered apples, salmon, and wheat--all quintessential Washington crops--even conventional farmers in the state are becoming concerned about the economic impact of GMOs.The non-GMO movement is, at its core, about the right to know. Because GMOs are unstable and experimental, they are subject to mandatory labeling in more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan, Russia, China, and all of the European Union. More research is needed to understand the long-term health and environmental implications of genetic engineering, but in the United States that research is essentially being conducted on the public, without consent.Despite biotechnology industry promises, none of the GMO traits currently on the market offers increased yield, drought tolerance, enhanced nutrition, or any consumer benefit. Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence connecting GMOs to health problems and environmental damage has triggered a massive public backlash.At the federal level, the Just Label It campaign has collected more than 1.3 million signatures on a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) petition demanding mandatory GMO labeling. Although the FDA has yet to respond, this is more than twice as many signatures as have ever been received on any food petition in the agency's history.Americans are also voting in record numbers with their wallets. The Non-GMO Project--a nonprofit organization that oversees North America's only third-party non-GMO verification, including ongoing ingredient testing--has quickly seen its label become the fastest growing in the natural products industry. With annual sales of well over $3.5 billion, Non-GMO Project Verified products are now found everywhere from independent food co-ops to big-box retailers.When the Non-GMO Project was founded in 2007, mandatory labeling efforts had almost completely stalled. In that void, the project's strategy was to leverage the power of the marketplace, using supply and demand principles to preserve and build a non-GMO food supply. When it began, skeptics far outweighed supporters; many said it would be impossible to get a critical mass of food companies to voluntarily adopt such rigorous standards. Six years later, the progress is astonishing. More than 1,000 brands are now enrolled in the Non-GMO Project's Product Verification Program, and more than 14,000 products have successfully earned the verification.This market demand and the corresponding rekindling of mandatory labeling efforts clearly show Americans are not willing to remain in the dark when it comes to the food we're eating and feeding to our loved ones. The momentum will continue until we have the same right to know about GMOs in our food as our peers around the world.Megan Westgate is the Executive Director of the Non-GMO Project, which offers North America's only third-party verification for products produced according to rigorous best practices for GMO avoidance. In recent years, this mission-driven organization has begun profoundly impacting the food supply in the US and Canada.

Lead ammunition is one of the leading sources of this poison left in the environment. Lead bullets often shatter into numerous small fragments inside targeted game animals, posing threats to human health when consumed in game meat and also to wildlife scavengers and carrion eaters that consume gut piles of game animals that are left behind on the ground. There are cost-comparable, performance-guaranteed alternatives to lead ammunition in the market today. All of these statements lead to one logical conclusion: It's time to end the use of lead ammunition for sport hunting in this country.Fortunately for Californians, last week Governor Jerry Brown signed first-in-the-nation legislation that would do just that. The Governor's historic decision is supported by thousands of citizens, a myriad of agencies and public health and environmental groups, nearly 20 newspapers from across the state, and the California State Senate and Assembly.This new law builds upon a long-standing federal requirement to use non-lead shot when hunting migratory waterfowl and a recent California law which required the use of non- lead ammunition for hunting within the range of the federally listed condor in California. Condors are among this nation's most endangered wildlife and lead fragments left behind in the carcasses of dead animals that they feed on have been a leading cause of condor deaths. Lead poisoning has become so serious for condors that they are frequently brought in from the wild to have lead removed from their blood, a painful and hugely stressful process for the birds that is not always successful.While the federal waterfowl requirement and the earlier California condor law were important victories in the battle to eliminate an unnecessary source of lead from our environment, they were only the beginning of a long but necessary fight. Condors, bald and golden eagles and other skilled hunting birds have continued to perish from lead poisoning picked up from injecting hunting ammunition.Thankfully, in California, as of last Friday, the state will be leading the nation in an entirely new, lead-free direction.But while the major shift in policy on lead ammunition in California is a huge step forward, the task of ridding lead from the environment is far from over. The toxic effects of lead do not stop at state lines, so the elimination of lead in hunting should not end at California's border. Governor Brown's decision to get lead out of the Golden State has set in motion what we hope will become a wave of actions to eliminate lead ammunition from hunting nationwide. The federal government should follow Governor Brown's example and end the use of lead ammunition for hunting on public lands, particularly on national wildlife refuges. The other 49 states should also pick up the cause and require non-lead ammunition for hunting on state and private lands.With all of the health risks and environmental contaminants we contend with on a daily basis, why would we not do ourselves and wildlife a long overdue favor by removing lead ammunition from hunting? Long ago, we stopped poisoning ourselves and our children with lead paint, lead pipes and leaded gasoline and decades ago, we stopped poisoning the environment with lead shot when hunting waterfowl.Governor Brown has done the courageous thing for the citizens of his state, and now the federal government and other states need to follow his lead and get the lead out of the rest of America."}, {"title": "Lessons From the SXSW Eco Conference -- and From Mother Nature", "text": "In the past two days, central Texas has been hit with a series of heavy rain storms which have caused flooding from overflowing creeks and streams. Ironically, the storms have swamped the central part of a state still suffering a severe, five-year-long drought that has caused widespread economic hardship and damage.The storms hit only a few days after Austin, one of Texas' most vibrant cities, hosted the SXSW Eco conference where more than 350 speakers spent three days talking about \"connecting passion to profession,\" in the words of the conference organizers. Their audience included a variety of environmental activists, engineers, educators, landscape architects, artists, economists, bankers, bicycle advocates, and many others. They met in the Austin Convention Center, mingled in nearby watering holes, or borrowed loaner bikes to explore the city of Austin.One session featured writers from across the country asking whether the media are accurately reporting on climate change, beyond a focus on extreme weather events. Another panel, which featured NYC's Chief Sustainability Officer, Dan Zarrilli, looked at the challenges of \"Futureproofing Cities.\" Zarrilli, like many New York leaders who saw the devastation of Superstorm Sandy, now understands that we need to prepare not just for storms like the last one, but for the next one which may be different than Sandy. To this end, we must look at New York and other coastal cities as interdependent systems where all the elements must work together to keep a livable city in the face of climate change.Austin was a perfect choice as a host city, and not just because this conference was a spinoff of the hugely successful SXSW music festival. Austin has almost 850,000 people and has grown by 40 percent in the last decade, making it one of the nation's fastest-growing cities. With large new office and residential buildings and neighborhoods sprouting all over, it has become a creative hub for start-up high tech companies and it is anchored by the University of Texas, with more than 50,000 students. It has a new light rail line, and next spring it will unveil its own bike share program, similar to those in New York, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Boston and other American and European cities.Austin is also a surprisingly green city. With 19,000 acres of parks, Austin has one of the largest urban park systems in the nation. According to the Trust for Public Land's ParkScore, Austin has a very high median park size, at 10 acres. Fully half of Austin residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park or open space. Among the major parks is the 1,000-acre Barton Creek Greenbelt, a massive series of interconnected open spaces running from the outskirts of the city to Lady Bird Lake, the city's central feature, named for former first ladyLady Bird Johnson, an Austin native and founder of the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center.The Barton Creek  ensemble, which includes a beautiful natural swimming pool beloved by locals, was created with the help of The Trust for Public Land two decades ago, and Austinites can hike, bike, climb and paddle (when the water is running) in its rustic surroundings. The \"lake\" that the creek ends in is in fact part of the Colorado River, which has been dammed in several places; just outside of the center, the outfall from the lake feeds the city's main drinking water reservoir and serves all of Austin.Climbers in the Barton Creek Greenbelt. Photo by Adrian Benepe.Barton Springs Pool. Photo by Adrian Benepe.Not content to rest on their laurels, the Austin Park and Recreation Department (PARD), headed by Sara Hensley, is embarking on several major initiatives to enhance the quality of life in Austin. One is a boardwalk path on the south side of Lady Bird Lake, now under construction, which will allow residents of the rapidly growing (and somewhat park-deprived) east side of the city to gain access to the wonderful waterfront parks and paths of Lady Bird Lake and the Barton Creek Greenbelt.As with other cities, PARD is partnering with several entrepreneurial non-profit organizations, including the Waller Creek Conservancy, to jointly improve access to and conditions of public space. Waller Creek is a 1.5-mile, narrow creek that runs down from the north, along the eastern side of the UT campus, right past the convention center, finally spilling into Lady Bird Lake. In its current somewhat degraded condition, it is still nonetheless an important ecosystem and partial recreational trail. But thanks to the conservancy, it will soon become a linear greenway connecting several parks, as redesigned by landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates (MVVA).Waller Creek as it flows by the Austin Convention Center. Photo by Adrian Benepe.Associated with the revival of the creek is the construction of an adjacent tunnel that will both help with the capture of stormwater from the occasional but intense rain storms, such as those the region saw over the weekend and which can cause flooding and stream bank erosion. The tunnel will also carry water from Lady Bird Lake to the head of the stream to help maintain a consistent water flow and the ecology of the creek. Two large parks and one smaller adjoining park will be improved and better melded with the creek and a continuous path under a plan envisioned by MVVA, which was one of four finalists in an international design competition launched in 2011.On the banks of Lady Bird Lake in Austin.

Photo by Adrian Benepe.While the future of Austin looks green from some angles, water is a determining factor, much as it is in coastal cities facing the challenge of rising sea levels and climate change-induced storms of greater frequency and intensity -- in Austin's case, the problem may be too little water overall, but with even stronger storms when the rains do come.Heather Venhaus, the Austin-based green infrastructure expert (she was an author of the Sustainable Sites Initiative while at the Johnson Wildflower Center, working with the American Society of Landscape Architects) cites the availability of water as the chief challenge facing Austin and many other Texas communities. The reservoir that is fed by the Colorado River is 20 feet lower than normal in the current state-wide drought conditions. As the daughter of a West Texas rancher, Venhaus, who spoke at the SXSW ECO conference, knows from water. As Venhaus sees it, \"The issues of flooding and drought are connected, due to too much impervious surface.\"Venhaus also suggests easing various building regulations to allow property owners to harvest and reuse rain water and air conditioner condensate for irrigation -- something currently difficult under health regulations. \"Every drop of rain that falls needs to be seen as a resource,\" says Venhaus. \"Slow it down, get it into the soil to recharge the aquifer instead of into the creeks.\""}, {"title": "Kayak, Rescued Hedgehog, Is So Cute And Inspiring We Almost Can't Handle It (VIDEO)", "text": "What's cuddly, but also spiky, with a superhero cape and a miniature skateboard?

He pays Hawaiian Electric Co. about $250 a month and he pays $300 monthly installments for the new solar panels on his roof in Ewa.Usually people pay a sizable bill to HECO or they invest in solar. So why is Walker doing both?The answer is that his new rooftop panels aren\u2019t generating any electricity so, while his solar payments were supposed to cancel out his normal electricity bill, he has to pay both. And since solar panels must be active for users to qualify for tax credits, he hasn\u2019t gotten any help from either the state or federal government.Walker isn\u2019t alone \u2014 hundreds of Oahu customers have gotten burned in their transition to solar. They have gotten caught in limbo since September 6 when HECO changed the rules for connecting solar systems.Customers and solar contractors are now being told to submit proposals for the installation of solar systems to HECO for review before they start the installation process.HECO warns that so much solar power is passing through its circuits that the extra energy could cause power disruptions for others and possibly jeopardize the safety of some of its employees. When the utility reviews proposed solar systems, it decides whether the customer may have to pay for studies of its electrical grid, as well as costs associated with upgrades of the grid so that it can handle power that the solar customer generates.Solar executives say the added costs per customer can reach into the thousands of dollars. And it's not clear that all individuals who are proposing solar systems will ultimately be allowed to proceed.Walker signed a contract for solar panels in mid-August. He says that he didn\u2019t find out about HECO\u2019s rule change until early October, a couple of days after the solar system had been installed on his roof.The utility says it can\u2019t give Walker \u2014 or other customers like him \u2014 any assurances about how long it might take before the power company connects his system, what the cost might be, or even whether it can be turned on at all. HECO has to review it.The wait is worrying for Walker, in part because he doesn\u2019t know how long it will last. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to watch our finances closely while we pay HECO and the loan off,\" Walker says.The solar limbo fiasco, which is cutting into the sales of solar companies, was the subject of a hearing on Monday before four committees of the state Legislature. Lawmakers heard testimony from HECO representatives, as well as from the solar industry.Scott Seu, an executive at HECO, told lawmakers that the utility will grandfather in 228 customers who had their solar system installed before the September 6 deadline, but hadn't yet submitted what's called a \u201cnet energy agreement\u201d to the utility.But solar executives estimate that there are hundreds of other customers who remain stuck like Walker.Some spent money to upgrade their roofs and electricity meters in preparation for the installation of panels, prior to the September 6 deadline, and even paid non-refundable city permit fees that can run between $800 and $900, Leslie Cole-Brooks told lawmakers. Cole-Brooks is the executive director of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, the major trade group for the solar industry.After all that, such people may have to wait a long time and then shell out some unknown additional amount of money to HECO to get their systems hooked up.Seu said that power company would work with the solar industry and with customers to try to address such issues. There are currently more than 1,000 solar systems that will require studies or upgrades to HECO's system, he added.The utility plans to conduct studies on four model circuits to give customers a better idea of whether their systems can be hooked up to HECO. The first study is slated for completion by the end of the year, and the last one in the first quarter of 2014.Lawmakers and some solar executives clarify that HECO isn't solely to blame for the predicament that such solar customers are in.Some solar companies are signing contracts with customers and installing solar systems without alerting customers to the potential or even likely limitations, and without discussing the projects with HECO first.In Walker\u2019s case, he signed a contract with Kailua-based solar contractor, Sunetric, in mid-August. He said Sunetric sent his wife an email in early October warning her about the evolving situation, but his wife didn\u2019t grasp what the email meant and discarded it. A few days later, Sunetric showed up and put solar panels on their roof. Walker and his wife found out from a neighbor shortly afterward that they faced a major problem.Should Sunetric have done more than send an email to the Walkers before it installed a $35,000 system on their roof that might not be turned on anytime soon? Walker said it is a point of contention with the solar company.Sunetric didn\u2019t immediately return a call for comment.Ronald and Janet Hayashi also face an uncertain solar future. The couple took money out of their 401k retirement fund to pay for solar panels, which can be a smart investment in a state with electricity prices as high as those in Hawaii. They say they signed a contract with Mercury Solar on September 14 and gave the company a down payment. They didn't find out until several weeks later that they could face a long wait and extra costs.Jason Binns, a vice president at Mercury Solar, didn't respond to a specific question from Civil Beat about why the Hayashi family\u2019s proposed system wasn't run by HECO before the contract was signed and the down payment made.But, in a written statement, Binns insisted that the company was communicating with its customers about HECO's rule changes.\u201cWe have been in close contact with Mr. & Mrs. Hayashi as well as the rest of our clients that are being affected by these changes,\u201d he said by email. \"We are also in close coordination with the appropriate officials at HECO to ensure that we are well within these new guidelines.\"But the Hayashi's said they were frustrated with HECO, and not Mercury Solar, and they hoped to have a solar system soon.Cole-Brooks, of the Hawaii Solar Energy Association, told lawmakers that solar companies should inform their customers about the rule changes.\"Clearly the customer needs to know,\" she said. \"We can't force all our members to act in a certain way. But that should be the industry standard.\"Solar StrugglesCustomers aren\u2019t the only ones suffering from the rule changes. The last few months would normally have been the solar industry\u2019s busiest time with customers rushing to take advantage of federal and state tax credits. But solar contractors say that business has nearly ground to a halt while inventory piles up in warehouses.Mark Duda, a principal at Honolulu-based RevoluSun, told lawmakers that it has submitted 231 system proposals to HECO for review. HECO has only approved six of them, Duda said.\u201cFor the most part, we haven\u2019t heard anything,\u201d said Duda.Some solar companies may face bankruptcy as they continue to shell out money for operating costs without closing sales, he lamented.Chris DeBone, a managing partner at Honolulu-based Hawaii Energy Connection, said that his company had more than 200 installations planned for September, but more than 120 of them are now on hold.He said that he understood the utility\u2019s challenges when it comes to safety and managing the electric grid, but he argued that the rule change was poorly executed.\u201cThe severity and timing of this was bad \u2014 very, very bad,\u201d he told Civil Beat.Seu apologized to lawmakers for HECO\u2019s handling of that change, but he said that it was a step that the utility had to take in order to ensure the safety of its grid and workers.\u201cThis is fundamentally about safety,\u201d he said.Not all lawmakers agreed. Rep. Cynthia Thielen questioned whether the rule change was meant to slow HECO's eroding customer base from embracing solar alternatives.\u201cThe utility seems to be fighting to save a doomed, obsolescent business model \u2014 one that hasn\u2019t changed since Edison invented the light bulb,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "A Healthy Challenge to Fracking Groupthink?", "text": "Two weeks ago, 50 environmental funders, non-profit leaders, and allies came to the Nathan Cummings Foundation offices for the taping of our web video series, Summits on Tenth. I moderated a discussion between Michael Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute and Kate Sinding of the National Resources Defense Council. The topic was fracking.  You can watch highlights from the debate and read reactions from several environmental leaders on Alternet, our partner in this series.New York State sits on Marcellus Shale, which contains large quantities of natural gas. New fracking technology has enabled oil and gas companies to more easily access this gas. Rising prices has made drilling more cost effective. Some states on Marcellus Shale, like Pennsylvania, have rushed to begin drilling. New York has been more cautious.  Kate supports the cautious approach; Michael is the more aggressive one.  We hosted this debate as we approach the 10th anniversary of a paper co-written by Michael and Ted Nordhaus, provocatively titled \"The Death of Environmentalism.\" It was a searing critique of the strategies and tactics of the environmental movement, written by two men who identified as leaders in that movement. The paper was funded by The Nathan Cummings Foundation.  The debate between Michael and Kate reflected this critique.  Michael's and Ted's paper provoked reactions from all corners. Today it is clear that it had an impact, leading many social change leaders -- in the environmental movement and beyond -- to question assumptions, silos and other previously unexamined habits that were hindering our collective success.  Personally, I'm not confident that we know how to manage the methane leakage associated with fracking. I don't know how much cleaner natural gas from fracking is when compared to coal. But I share Michael's concern that we all, at times, allow our passions and habits to obscure our reason, and even our compassion.  For example, those of us concerned about climate change should pay more attention to the urgent energy access needs of the global poor. Two billion people around the world suffer miserably because they are energy poor. Getting these people access to energy is a progressive value, as it was when the Tennessee Valley Authority electrified the South. Our challenge is to make sure that energy is as cheap and clean as possible.  During the debate, Michael and Kate were asked what they would say to a coal miner in Kentucky who is suffering as we replace coal with natural gas. Michael was right not to sugarcoat the consequences of leaving coal behind, but used the question to underscore the importance of a strong safety net. We need to catch workers when they fall during a transition from one line of work to another. And we need to respect the pain felt by communities, like coal miners, for whom their livelihood and culture are closely interwoven.  And yet, iconoclasm can have its limits. How can we critique our own work and the work of our allies in a way that prompts then to reflect and maybe even adjust rather than retrench? How are we tough on the problems but soft on the people? How do we help each other bring our \"A\" game?  To those of us who support innovation and risk taking, these are important challenges. Investment in innovation can become idolatry and the obsessive worship of it is the opposite of innovative. And risk taking can devolve into a posture that involves no risk at all; simply an infallible certainty that forecloses conversation and ultimately, change."}, {"title": "Lighting Strikes Right In Front Of Boat, Barely Missing Fisherman", "text": "Lightning can strike faster than a heartbeat.In this incredible six-second video, a fisherman narrowly avoids a bolt of lightning while boating on Lake Athens in Texas.

As a US-based alliance of food justice, anti-hunger, labor, environmental, faith-based, and food producer groups, the USFSA upholds the right to food as a basic human right and works to connect US struggles to the international movement for food sovereignty.Next week, the USFSA is awarding the 5th Annual Food Sovereignty Prize, which recognizes grassroots initiatives that are building solutions to poverty and hunger, and resisting the corporate control of food and trade systems.

This is both their right as well as a way to keep Port-au-Prince from becoming even more perilously overcrowded;Addressing an ongoing food crisis. Today, even with imports, more than 2.4 million people out of a population of 9 million are estimated to be food-insecure. Acute malnutrition among children under the age 5 is 9%, and chronic under-nutrition for that age group is 24%. Peasant groups are convinced that, with the necessary investment, Haiti could produce at least 80% of its food consumption needs; andPromoting a post-earthquake redevelopment plan that serves the needs of the majority, unlike the one currently promoted by the U.S. and U.N. which is based on the growth of sweatshops. (See \"\".)This year, one of the U.S. Food Sovereignty Alliance prizes goes to Four Focused Eyes (Kat Zye Kontre), a coalition of Haiti's four largest and strongest peasant organizations, who are addressing these needs head-on. The name comes from an expression pertaining to cheating in Haitian card games, \"Four focused eyes, an end to lies,\" and refers to the long-term distrust between some of these organizations.Four Focused Eyes includes the country's two national peasant groups - T\u00e8t Kole Ti Peyizan Ayisyen, or Heads Together Small Producers of Haiti, and the National Peasant Movement of the Papay Congress (MPNKP) - plus the two largest regional organizations - the Peasant Movement of Papay (MPP by its Creole acronym) and the Regional Coordination of the Organizations of the South-East (KROS).The coalition is building unity and strength for the common agenda. Together, they are helping the peasant sector become both more capable of growing food, and shore up might to win policies that promote domestic agriculture. Four Focused Eyes is pushing the state for a pro-peasant agenda, especially around food sovereignty and land reform, through mobilization and advocacy. They are advancing their agenda collectively through negotiations with the Ministry of Agriculture and national pressure. Moreover, they are making common cause with other farmer movements and allies around the globe, such as the U.S. Food Sovereignty Alliance and La Via Campesina, to fight for trade and foreign policies that promote small-farmer food, agriculture, and land systems.Like their counterparts the world over, these farmers are focused principally on building food sovereignty. They are on the frontlines of a clash between two development models: food sovereignty and neoliberalism.Food sovereignty is the right of a people to define their own food and agricultural systems, premised on growing domestically for domestic consumption. It is based on other social and economic rights, too: the right to food, the right of rural peoples to produce, and the right to land.Food sovereignty promotes small-scale agriculture, government management of food imports, protection of native seeds, and large-scale redistribution of land with protections of land tenure for small farmers. It calls for the democratic participation of the population in shaping trade policies and for development programs which protect domestic production, especially by small growers.The opposing model, neoliberalism, is the one governing farming in Haiti and much of the world. An ideology as well as a set of free-market policies and programs, neoliberalism opposes a significant role of government or community in planning, investing in, or intervening into markets in ways which could protect and promote national development. Neoliberalism gives primacy to corporate control over domestic production and the environment. Key players here include the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, governments of industrialized countries, large landholders, and corporations.The model is based on global trade rules which allow rich countries to make profits off Haiti and other low-income countries in two ways. The first is as a source of cheap, raw goods for the so-called First World, which are extracted or produced by intensive exploitation of labor, land, and other resources. Haiti used to fill this role, historically exporting hardwoods and more recently - until the 1908s - foodstuffs, until the agricultural sector no longer had the capacity to do so.Low-income countries' second role is as a market for corporate goods from high-income countries. The trade policies of wealthy nations and the conditions on loans by international financial institutions pressure low-income countries to lower import tariffs, though high-income countries' own production remains protected by subsidies. In Haiti, conditions on two loans from the IMF, in the 1980s and 1990s, forced the government to reduce tariffs on food imports to as low as 3% from former levels of up to 150%. This made it suddenly cheaper to buy food from U.S. agribusiness than from the farmer the next field over, thus effectively putting out of business the farmer in that next field.Until the early 1980s, Haiti was largely self-sufficient in food, but now domestic agriculture meets only 43% of Haitians' food consumption needs. This has led to the further impoverishment of the small farmer sector; those who still try to survive through growing do so in grinding destitution. Another option has been to flee to the cities, and for more than three decades peasants have been arriving in droves for Port-au-Prince, where they have found jobs in the assembly sector or the informal sector if they were lucky, or have remained unemployed if they weren't. This led to another impact of so-called free trade policies: the dense population in Port-au-Prince of rural emigrants and others, virtually all of them living in shoddy housing on terrain often unsuitable for dwellings, contributed greatly to the high death toll (estimated at 250,000 to 300,000) from the January, 2010 earthquake.Attaining food sovereignty in Haiti would necessitate a governmental commitment to invest significantly in agriculture. Farmers need support for tools, seeds, credit, irrigation and water storage systems, and assistance from agronomists. Food sovereignty must involve land reform, since peasants currently don't have the land they need to grow. It would mean staunching the flow of dumped U.S. commodities which, more than ever since the earthquake, has meant that Haitian farmers either have to sell their food for a pittance or cannot sell it at all. Food sovereignty would require raising tariffs on food imports to protect national production.Food sovereignty would also involve turning around Haiti's ecological crisis, since its effects - topsoil erosion, deforestation, destruction of watersheds, floods, and droughts - all impede agricultural production. Some Haitian farmer-activists are promoting a set of programs to address this crisis, with their own programs of reforestation, integrated water management, and creation of non-charcoal energy sources. But the farmers say they cannot reverse the environmental decline on their own, and ask the government to commit to national programs and to enforce ecological protection laws that are already on the books.Food sovereignty in Haiti would require, furthermore, passing a law against genetically modified [GMO] seeds and limiting multinational corporate involvement in Haiti's seeds, which Haitian farmers call \"the patrimony of humanity.\" The need has been underscored this year by new imports of seeds from Pioneer and Monsanto. Some of them, such as Monsanto's calypso tomato seeds, are treated with deadly poisons which the EPA banned for home use in the U.S. While Monsanto, for one, is donating its seeds at the moment, one suspects that that largesse will quickly end and that farmers will be forced to buy them in subsequent years. Meanwhile, agriculture becomes dependent on foreign corporations for the very foundation of agriculture.

To weaken efforts to fight global warming, the \"climate change denial machine,\" in the words of the Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society, has been using that same strategy. For more than 20 years it has sought to cast doubt on the science that demonstrates that the climate is changing and pollution is to blame.Why is anyone still paying attention?The denial lobby is using pseudo-science and cherry-picked data to present the fringe view that global warming is nothing more than what Sen. James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, famously called \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\"Once again it has reprised its tired -- and false -- arguments to debunk the premier scientific assessment of global warming, produced by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On Sept. 27, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization declared with near certainty that human activity is causing the climate to change. The panel's previous assessment, issued in 2007, was only slightly less certain -- 90 percent versus the 95 percent in the new report. An overwhelming majority of climate scientists endorsed it.In short, the global warming deniers are as wrong as the smoke-blowers who said in the 1960s that a pack a day was fine. No one seriously argues today that tobacco isn't bad for you -- and if they did, no one would listen. But the Marlboro Men of global warming still draw attention as they deny the consensus conclusion that burning fossil fuels in power plants, cars and factories is trapping heat in the atmosphere. They deny that this will raise sea levels, bring more violent storms and worsen droughts and heat waves. What are they smoking?Do we have a dog in this fight? Absolutely. We just think the debate should be about fact, not fiction. We are not trying to muzzle those who disagree with us. There will be plenty to disagree about in deciding what actions to take. But it is time to ignore false and misleading statements that mask the source's bias and scam the public.With the new attention that the I.P.C.C. report brings to the science of global warming, in coming weeks more than a few serious news reporters may be tempted in the name of \"balance\" to quote the deniers, who have presented increasingly discredited messages: Global warming is not happening. Or if it is, it is not caused by carbon dioxide emissions or other human activity. Or, well, it won't have an impact -- we'll be fine.Who is saying what?For those who write about global warming, spreading the pronouncements of fringe \"skeptics\" doesn't show balance. For those who read about global warming, it equates serious climate science and evaluation of peer-reviewed reports with the declarations of individuals, most lacking academic degrees in climate research, who are often funded by those standing to profit if the United States fails to curb carbon dioxide emissions.The attention paid to the deniers has real consequences.For one, it puts pressure on the I.P.C.C. to censor its conclusions.Climate \"skeptics\" have vilified the U.N. panel, made up of several hundred of the world's leading climate scientists, subjecting them to \"abusive language on blogs, comparisons to the Unabomber, e-mail hacking and even occasional death threats,\" Justin Gillis wrote in the New York Times.\"Who could blame the panel if it wound up erring on the side of scientific conservatism,\" he wrote shortly before the experts issued their report. The clear implication: The criticism could lead the panel to pull its punches when, he wrote, most would want \"an unvarnished analysis\" of global warming's risks.More broadly, relying on the deniers to provide \"balance\" also helps create political pressure that makes it all the more difficult to act against global warming.It fuels efforts in the House of Representatives to thwart sensible measures to fight climate change. A solid majority of House Republicans denies that global warming is even occurring, pointing to the alleged disagreements among scientists to justify siding with the fossil-fuel industry.At a minimum, good journalism -- and the readers' right to be fully informed -- requires identifying a source's stake. Is the source an environmentalist or coal or oil spokesperson? Their interests are clear.But what about those claiming expertise or academic credentials in climate science who are supported by think tanks and front groups funded by oil, coal and others with a financial stake in the debate? The reader deserves to know their potential for bias. Better yet, it's time to toss the denial machine into the bin of discredited ideas. It can keep Joe Camel company.This commentary originally appeared here.Dan Becker directs the Safe Climate Campaign, which advocates strong measures against global warming.James Gerstenzang, who covered the White House for the Los Angeles Times, is the campaign's editorial director."}, {"title": "Fossil Fuel Euphoria", "text": "Hallelujah, Oil and Gas Forever!Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comFor years, energy analysts had been anticipating an imminent decline in global oil supplies. Suddenly, they\u2019re singing a new song: Fossil fuels growing scarce? Don\u2019t even think about it! The news couldn\u2019t be better: fossil fuels will become ever more abundant. And all that talk about climate change? Don\u2019t worry about it, they chant. Go out and enjoy the benefits of cheap and plentiful energy forever.This movement from gloom about our energy future to what can only be called fossil-fuel euphoria may prove to be the hallmark of our peculiar moment. In a speech this September, for instance, Barry Smitherman, chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission (that state\u2019s energy regulatory agency), claimed that the Earth possesses a \u201crelatively boundless supply\u201d of oil and natural gas. Not only that -- and you can practically hear the chorus of cheering in Houston and other oil centers -- but many of the most exploitable new deposits are located in the U.S. and Canada. As a result -- add a roll of drums and a blaring of trumpets -- the expected boost in energy is predicted to provide the United States with a cornucopia of economic and political rewards, including industrial expansion at home and enhanced geopolitical clout abroad. The country, exulted Karen Moreau of the New York State Petroleum Council, another industry cheerleader, is now in a position \u201cto become a global superpower on energy.\u201dThere are good reasons to be deeply skeptical of such claims, but that hardly matters when they are gaining traction in Washington and on Wall Street. What we're seeing is a sea change in elite thinking on the future availability and attractiveness of fossil fuels. Senior government officials, including President Obama, have already become infected with this euphoria, as have top Wall Street investors -- which means it will have a powerful and longlasting, though largely pernicious, effect on the country\u2019s energy policy, industrial development, and foreign relations.The speed and magnitude of this shift in thinking has been little short of astonishing. Just a few years ago, we were girding for the imminent prospect of \u201cpeak oil,\u201d the point at which daily worldwide output would reach its maximum and begin an irreversible decline. This, experts assumed, would result in a global energy crisis, sky-high oil prices, and severe disruptions to the world economy.Today, peak oil seems a distant will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Experts at the U.S. government\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA) confidently project that global oil output will reach 115 million barrels per day by 2040 -- a stunning 34% increase above the current level of 86 million barrels. Natural gas production is expected to soar as well, leaping from 113 trillion cubic feet in 2010 to a projected 185 trillion in 2040.These rosy assessments rest to a surprising extent on a single key assumption: that the United States, until recently a declining energy producer, will experience a sharp increase in output through the exploitation of shale oil and natural gas reserves through hydro-fracking and other technological innovations. \u201cIn a matter of a few years, the trends have reversed,\u201d Moreau declared last February. \u201cThere is a new energy reality of vast domestic resources of oil and natural gas brought about by advancing technology... For the first time in generations, we are able to see that our energy supply is no longer limited, foreign, and finite; it is American and abundant.\u201dThe boost in domestic oil and gas output, it is further claimed, will fuel an industrial renaissance in the United States -- with new plants and factories being built to take advantage of abundant local low-cost energy supplies. \u201cThe economic consequences of this supply-and-demand revolution are potentially extraordinary,\u201d asserted Ed Morse, the head of global commodities research at Citigroup in New York. America\u2019s gross domestic product, he claimed, will grow by 2% to 3% over the next seven years as a result of the energy revolution alone, adding as much as $624 billion to the national economy. Even greater gains can be made, Morse and others claim, if the U.S. becomes a significant exporter of fossil fuels, particularly in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG).Not only will these developments result in added jobs -- as many as three million, claims energy analyst Daniel Yergin -- but they will also enhance America\u2019s economic status vis-\u00e0-vis its competitors. \u201cU.S. natural gas is abundant and prices are low -- a third of their level in Europe and a quarter of that in Japan,\u201d Yergin wrote recently. \u201cThis is boosting energy-intensive manufacturing in the U.S., much to the dismay of competitors in both Europe and Asia.\u201dThis fossil fuel euphoria has even surfaced in statements by President Obama. For all his talk of climate change perils and the need to invest in renewables, he has also gloated over the jump in domestic energy production and promised to facilitate further increases. \u201cLast year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003,\u201d he affirmed in March 2011. \u201cAnd for the first time in more than a decade, oil we imported accounted for less than half of the liquid fuel we consumed. So that was a good trend. To keep reducing that reliance on imports, my administration is encouraging offshore oil exploration and production.\u201dMoney Pouring into Fossil FuelsThis burst of euphoria about fossil fuels and America\u2019s energy future is guaranteed to have a disastrous impact on the planet. In the long term, it will make Earth a hotter, far more extreme place to live by vastly increasing carbon emissions and diverting investment funds from renewables and green energy to new fossil fuel projects. For all the excitement these endeavors may be generating, it hardly takes a genius to see that they mean ever more carbon dioxide heading into the atmosphere and an ever less hospitable planet.The preference for fossil fuel investments is easy to spot in the industry\u2019s trade journals, as well as in recent statistical data and anecdotal reports of all sorts. According to the reliable International Energy Agency (IEA), private and public investment in fossil fuel projects over the next quarter century will outpace investment in renewable energy by a ratio of three to one. In other words, for every dollar spent on new wind farms, solar arrays, and tidal power research, three dollars will go into the development of new oil fields, shale gas operations, and coal mines.From industry sources it\u2019s clear that big-money investors are rushing to take advantage of the current boom in unconventional energy output in the U.S. -- the climate be damned. \u201cThe dollars needed [to develop such projects] have never been larger,\u201d commented Maynard Holt, co-president of Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. \u201cBut the money is truly out there. The global energy capital river is flowing our way.\u201dIn the either/or equation that seems to be our energy future, the capital river is rushing into the exploitation of unconventional fossil fuels, while it\u2019s slowing to a trickle in the world of the true unconventionals -- the energy sources that don\u2019t add carbon to the atmosphere. This, indeed, was the conclusion reached by the IEA, which in 2012 warned that the seemingly inexorable growth in greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide is likely to eliminate all prospect of averting the worst effects of climate change.Petro MachismoThe new energy euphoria is also fueling a growing sense that the American superpower, whose influence has recently seemed to be on the wane, may soon acquire fresh geopolitical clout through its mastery of the latest energy technologies. \u201cAmerica\u2019s new energy posture allows us to engage from a position of greater strength,\u201d crowed National Security Adviser Tom Donilon in an April address at Columbia University. Increased domestic energy output, he explained, will help reduce U.S. vulnerability to global supply disruptions and price hikes. \u201cIt also affords us a stronger hand in pursuing and implementing our international security goals.\u201dA new elite consensus is forming around the strategic advantages of expanded oil and gas production. In particular, this outlook holds that the U.S. is benefiting from substantially reduced oil imports from the Middle East by eliminating a dependency that has led to several disastrous interventions in that region and exposed the country to periodic disruptions in oil deliveries, starting with the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74. \u201cThe shift in oil sources means the global supply system will become more resilient, our energy supplies will become more secure, and the nation will have more flexibility in dealing with crises,\u201d Yergin wrote in the Wall Street Journal.This turnaround, he and other experts claim, is what allowed Washington to adopt a tougher stance with Tehran in negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program. With the U.S. less dependent on Middle Eastern oil, so goes the argument, American leaders need not fear Iranian threats to disrupt the flow of oil through the Persian Gulf to international markets. \u201cThe substantial increase in oil production in the United States,\u201d Donilon declared in April, is what allowed Washington to impose tough sanctions on Iranian oil \u201cwhile minimizing the burdens on the rest of the world.\u201dA stance of what could be called petro machismo is growing in Washington, underlying such initiatives as the president\u2019s widely ballyhooed policy announcement of a \u201cpivot\u201d from the Middle East to Asia (still largely words backed by only the most modest of actions) and efforts to constrain Russia\u2019s international influence.Ever since Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency of that country, Moscow has sought to sway the behavior of its former Warsaw Pact allies and the former republics of the Soviet Union by exploiting its dominant energy role in the region. It offered cheap natural gas to governments willing to follow its policy dictates, while threatening to cut off supplies to those that weren\u2019t. Now, some American strategists hope to reduce Russia\u2019s clout by helping friendly nations like Poland and the Baltic states develop their own shale gas reserves and build LNG terminals. These would allow them to import gas from \u201cfriendly\u201d states, including the U.S. (once its LNG export capacities are expanded). \u201cIf we can export some natural gas to Europe and to Japan and other Asian nations,\u201d Karen Moreau suggested in February, \u201cwe strengthen our relationships and influence in those places -- and perhaps reduce the influence of other producers such as Russia.\u201dThe crucial issue is this: if American elites continue to believe that increased oil and gas production will provide the U.S. with a strategic advantage, Washington will be tempted to exercise a \u201cstronger hand\u201d when pursuing its \u201cinternational security goals.\u201d The result will undoubtedly be heightened international friction and discord.Is the Euphoria Justified?There is no doubt that the present fossil fuel euphoria will lead in troubling directions, even if the rosy predictions of rising energy output are, in the long run, likely to prove both unreliable and unrealistic. The petro machismo types make several interconnected claims:* The world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves are vast, especially when \u201cunconventional\u201d sources of fuel -- Canadian tar sands, shale gas, and the like -- are included.* The utilization of advanced technologies, especially fracking, will permit the effective exploitation of a significant share of these untapped reserves (assuming that governments don\u2019t restrict fracking and other controversial drilling activities).* Fossil fuels will continue to supply an enormous share of global energy requirements for the foreseeable future, even given rising world temperatures, growing public opposition, and other challenges.Each of these assertions is packed with unacknowledged questions and improbabilities that are impossible to explore thoroughly in an article of this length. But here are some major areas of doubt.To begin with, those virtually \u201cboundless\u201d untapped oil reserves have yet to be systematically explored, meaning that it\u2019s impossible to know if they do, in fact, contain commercially significant reserves of oil and gas. To offer an apt example, the U.S. Geological Survey, in one of the most widely cited estimates of untapped energy reserves, has reported that approximately 13% of the world\u2019s undiscovered oil reserves and 30% percent of its natural gas lie above the Arctic Circle. But this assessment is based on geological analyses of rock samples, not exploratory drilling. Whether the area actually holds such large reserves will not be known until widespread drilling has occurred. So far, initial Arctic drilling operations, like those off Greenland, have generally proved disappointing.Similarly, the Energy Information Administration has reported that China possesses vast shale formations that could harbor substantial reserves of oil and gas. According to a 2013 EIA survey, that country\u2019s technically recoverable shale gas reserves are estimated at 1,275 trillion cubic feet, more than twice the figure for the United States. Once again, however, the real extent of those reserves won\u2019t be known without extensive drilling, which is only in its beginning stages.To say, then, that global reserves are \u201cboundless\u201d is to disguise all the hypotheticals lurking within that description. Reality may fall far short of industry claims.The effectiveness of new technologies in exploiting such problematic reserves is also open to question. True, fracking and other unconventional technologies have already substantially increased the production of hard-to-exploit fuels, including tar sands, shale gas, and deep-sea reserves. Many experts predict that such gains are likely to be repeated in the future. The EIA, for example, suggests that U.S. output of shale oil via fracking will jump by 221% over the next 15 years, and natural gas by 164%. The big question, however, is whether these projected increases will actually come to fruition. While early gains are likely, the odds are that future growth will come at a far slower pace.As a start, the most lucrative U.S. shale formations in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Texas have already experienced substantial exploration and many of the most attractive drilling sites (or \u201cplays\u201d) are now fully developed. More fracking, no doubt, will release additional oil and gas, but the record shows that fossil-fuel output tends to decline once the earliest, most promising reservoirs are exploited. In fact, notes energy analyst Art Berman, \u201cseveral of the more mature shale gas plays are either in decline or appear to be approaching peak production.\u201dDoubts are also multiplying over the potential for exploiting shale reserves in other parts of the world. Preliminary drilling suggests that many of the shale formations in Europe and China possess fewer hydrocarbons and will be harder to develop than those now being exploited in this country. In Poland, for example, efforts to extract domestic shale reserves have been stymied by disappointing drilling efforts and the subsequent departure of major foreign firms, including Exxon Mobil and Marathon Oil.Finally, there is a crucial but difficult to assess factor in the future energy equation: the degree to which energy companies and energy states will run into resistance when exploiting ever more remote (and environmentally sensitive) resource zones. No one yet knows how much energy industry efforts may be constrained by the growing opposition of local residents, scientists, environmentalists, and others who worry about the environmental degradation caused by unconventional energy extraction and the climate consequences of rising fossil fuel combustion. Despite industry claims that fracking, tar sands production, and Arctic drilling can be performed without endangering local residents, harming the environment, or wrecking the planet, ever more people are coming to the opposite conclusion -- and beginning to take steps to protect their perceived interests.In New York State, for example, a fervent anti-fracking oppositional movement has prevented government officials from allowing such activities to begin in the rich Marcellus shale formation, one of the largest in the world. Although Albany may, in time, allow limited fracking operations there, it is unlikely to permit large-scale drilling throughout the state. Similarly, an impressive opposition in British Columbia to the proposed Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline, especially by the native peoples of the region, has put that project on indefinite hold. And growing popular opposition to fracking in Europe is making itself felt across the region. The European Parliament, for example, recently imposed tough environmental constraints on the practice.As heat waves and extreme storm activity increase, so will concern over climate change and opposition to wholesale fossil fuel extraction. The IEA warned of this possibility in the 2012 edition of its World Energy Outlook. Shale gas and other unconventional forms of natural gas are predicted to provide nearly half the net gain in world gas output over the next 25 years, the report noted. \u201cThere are,\u201d it added, \u201calso concerns about the environmental impact of producing unconventional gas that, if not properly addressed, could halt the unconventional gas revolution in its tracks.\u201dReaction to that IEA report last November was revealing. Its release prompted a mini-wave of ecstatic commentary in the American media about its prediction that, thanks to the explosion in unconventional energy output, this country would soon overtake Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s leading oil producer. In fact, the fossil fuel craze can be said to have started with this claim. None of the hundreds of articles and editorials written on the subject, however, bothered to discuss the caveats the report offered or its warnings of planetary catastrophe.As is so often the case with mass delusions, those caught up in fossil fuel mania have not bothered to think through the grim realities involved. While industry bigwigs may continue to remain on an energy high, the rest of us will not be so lucky. The accelerated production and combustion of fossil fuels can have only one outcome: a severely imperiled planet.Michael T.

The beach had previously been accessible to the public via a small fee for years before it was taken under new ownership, and suddenly access was no longer permitted. A series of closed gates and trespassing signs made that apparent as Vinod Khosla, co-Founder of Sun Microsystems and the alleged new owner of the land, had decided on new rules.Shortly after paddling out, Sheriff vehicles arrived at the beach, and the surfers were told they were under arrest for trespassing.But were they trespassing?The Surfrider Foundation and The California Coastal Act of 1976, a piece of legislation that ensures under California State Law that navigable waters remain open to the public, say otherwise. The city of San Mateo agreed, and this February, charges against the surfers were dropped, citing \"insufficient evidence.\"Intrigued by the case, The Inertia, Surfing's Definitive Online Community, and Surfrider Foundation created a short film exploring its implications - not only on the on beach access issues at Martin's Beach, but also across America.Today, the surfers are free, but the gates remain closed and lawsuits continue as Surfrider Foundation has sued Khosla for infringement of the California Coastal Act.Similar access issues have bubbled to the surface in Chicago, Texas, and New Jersey, and these legal battles will have a meaningful impact on how American citizens access them.It may be true that nobody owns the beach. But how we get there is another story altogether. Please take a minute and watch the story of five surfers using their constitutional rights to battle a billionaire and ensure America's beaches are free for all to enjoy."}, {"title": "5 Types of People Who Should Care About Civil Eats, and Why", "text": "If you haven\u2019t yet given to Civil Eats, you should. Their Kickstarter campaign ends Friday at 4:51 Pacific. If they don\u2019t raise the $100,000 that editors Naomi Starkman and Paula Crossfield \u2013 neither of whom has ever been paid for their work on Civil Eats \u2013 are seeking to be able to pay their writers, the site may shut down in 2014. They\u2019ve already raised more than half that amount, but have just a few days left to raise the rest.Here are some of the kinds of people who have an interest in Civil Eats\u2019 future, whether they realize it or not:The past few decades have made Swiss cheese of the media industry, leaving holes where once there were trusted sources, even on topics as vital as food. Social media and citizen journalism has filled some of those gaps, but reporting in this area is more important than ever \u2013 even as the good food movement has gained traction (evidenced by the rise in farmers\u2019 markets and community garden projects as well as a surge of interest in cooking, farming and food politics, too) a handful of the largest players in the food industry continue to dwarf the growth of small producers. And they dominate information about food, too \u2013 in the midst of the rapidly changing media landscape, food marketers are spending more than ever to reach us and our kids on every electronic device we own to convince us that everything is cool, that their products are healthy for us as well as the planet.Civil Eats hosts the storytellers who\u2019ve stepped in to fill the media gap \u2013 the nonprofit experts, the hungry new food journalists, the clear-eyed social entrepreneurs \u2013 who are in most cases the same people who are also trying to improve our food system.Five years ago, Naomi Starkman and Paula Crossfield \u2013 witnessing a dearth of quality food and agriculture reporting in the mainstream media and a stream of quality content coming out of advocacy groups and independent writers, founded Civil Eats. Since then, hundreds of good food advocates (including this author and her colleagues) have worked with Starkman and Crossfield to craft their stories, learn valuable writing and editing skills, find their voices and post or cross-post their work there, collectively earning millions of page views on the site. Today, around 100k visitors visit Civil Eats each month to read quality information about the food they eat and its social and environmental impacts.\u201dCivil Eats has become the hub for the good food movement,\u201d says Starkman. \u201cWe like to think of it as a \u2018Community Supported Blog,\u2019 because we offer a platform to myriad voices who care about the intersection of food and politics. Today, we continue to identify writers and ideas and stay ahead of the news, to bring important information to a growing public who are hungry for these issues.\u201dCivil Eats wasn't an entirely new idea \u2013 Bay Area-based Bonnie Powell\u2019s Ethicurean ruled the scene when I started blogging, along with its East Coast counterpart, Kerry Trueman\u2019s Eating Liberally. Both food politics blogs ran guest posts from other writers and the Ethicurean in particular had several regular contributors, but even at that, over time Bonnie and Kerry and their cohorts couldn\u2019t keep pouring in the hours (running a blog is time consuming, people!) without getting paid for it. The question of how to do quality journalism and make a living is one of the biggest of our time, and nobody has a clear sense of how to make it work, but Civil Eats has proven itself to be a winning new media model. $100,000 would buy them not only a fulltime paid editor and a D.C. correspondent, it would buy them a year to figure out how to make this model sustainable.The campaign is a do-or-die moment for Civil Eats. With the $100,000 from the Kickstarter endeavor, Starkman and Crossfield hope to attract further funding from foundations and a membership program they're developing. So either they make the money now and take the site to the next level now or they shut it down next year, because they simply cannot continue to support it as a labor of love, or expect their contributors to do so, either.I sincerely hope Civil Eats gets the funding it needs and deserves, because I think its founders are onto something, because it\u2019s a simple but grand experiment in new media, and because it\u2019s such a solid source for good quality information about one of the most important things to human existence \u2013 the food we eat and the systems by which it is produced. Everyone has an interest in this one.If you can\u2019t afford to give to Civil Eats, please consider sharing their Kickstarter appeal via email, Facebook, Twitter or by any other means you can.Originally published at Ecocentric."}, {"title": "Europe's Air Pollution Spurred By Growing Use Of Wood Fires And Diesel Cars, Watchdog Group Says", "text": "* Report says EU pollution causes early deaths, crop damage* Levels of some pollutants falling more slowly than others* EU expected to propose tighter pollution limits (Adds Environment Commissioner on legislative proposals)By Charlie DunmoreBRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Air pollution is dangerously high across many parts of Europe, resulting in premature deaths, ill health and huge economic losses linked to reduced crop yields, Europe's environmental watchdog said on Tuesday.While emissions of some pollutants have declined sharply in Europe in recent decades, more diesel cars and a rise in wood burning by households as a cheap alternative to gas mean other types of harmful pollution are receding more slowly.European regulators are expected to propose a tightening of EU limits on microscopic particles known as particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants, with legislative proposals expected before the end of the year.A total of 22 European countries including France, Italy and Poland exceeded the daily EU limit value for PM in 2011, while stricter, non-binding guideline limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO) were exceeded at most monitoring stations across continental Europe, according to a report by the European Environment Agency (EEA).EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said it should be realistic for the European Union to achieve WHO guidelines by 2050 at the latest and debate was ongoing on what kind of interim targets the Commission would propose.\"My main objective is to put the EU on a clear pathway towards achieving WHO guidelines,\" he said at a presentation of the EEA report. \"It's a roadmap for how we can live longer, live healthier and protect our fragile ecosystems better.\"PROGRESS SO FARIn the last decade, tighter European regulations on power stations and other sources of pollution have seen a 50 percent cut in emissions of sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain, while carbon monoxide emissions have fallen by a third.By contrast, the amount of harmful particles and ozone in the air has fallen only slightly. Combined with WHO findings that lower concentrations of air pollution can be more harmful than previously thought, pressure is building on the European Union to do more.\"Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, Executive Director of the Copenhagen-based EEA.The tighter proposed limits on PM could pose problems for EU governments, many of which have struggled to meet the existing limits in force since 2010, resulting in up to a third of Europeans being exposed to dangerous levels of PM pollution.In its report, the EEA said PM pollution - particularly in urban areas - posed the greatest risk to human health because it can pass directly from the lungs into the bloodstream.Although struggling to meet the limits, cities in Europe - along with the Americas - enjoy relatively low average PM pollution levels compared with those in southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, WHO data showed.Ground-level ozone pollution - formed indirectly by a combination of sunlight and mixtures of other pollutants in the atmosphere - inflicts huge damage on EU crop production, particularly in Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Spain.It has been estimated that ozone pollution resulted in production losses of 27 million tonnes of grain in Europe in 2000.The increasing number of diesel vehicles on Europe's roads, particularly newer models, are a major source of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main precursor pollutants that form ozone, the report says.That is because while modern diesel exhaust after-treatment systems reduce fine particle and other emissions, they increase direct nitrogen dioxide emissions.

They are the second-most endangered marine mammal in the United States, and their numbers continue to decline.Here\u2019s, in eight adorable photos, is a look at Kamilo the monk seal\u2019s life, which in just six short months illustrates the extraordinary challenges facing Hawaiian monk seal conservation.1. Hawaiian monk seals are only found among the Hawaiian Islands. They are thought to have existed for millions of years and at one point to have had a population in the tens of thousands. Today, only about 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals are alive, roughly 900 in the remote northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and only 200 in the populated islands. On the remote islands, monk seals are starving from lack of fish and are being eaten by sharks. On the main islands, the dangers are man-made: ingesting fish hooks, getting caught in nets, and being run over by motor boats. A slew of \u201cassassinations\u201d even prompted a New York Times Magazine piece on why monk seals were being mysteriously murdered across the islands.2. After birthing all her other pups on Molokai island, Kamilo's mother swam all the way to the Big Island to give birth to Kamilo on April 10, 2013 in Kaiole Bay. As is Hawaiian custom, Kamilo was given his name by the kupuna (elders) of the region in which he was born. After about 6 weeks, his mother left him, and Kamilo set out alone, swimming along the Big Island shore.3. The NOAA uses bleach marks to identify monk seals. Using Clairol hair dye, NOAA snuck up on Kamilo while he was sleeping and painted his tag -- H-05 -- in his fur. In addition to the NOAA, Kamilo is looked after by volunteers from the Monk Seal Foundation and the Marine Mammal Center.4. But volunteers can\u2019t watch Kamilo\u2019s every move. The first year of his life is the most crucial \u2013 newborn monk seals have only a 20% chance of survival. When the pups' mothers leave them, they crave affection. They will try to hug sea turtles, branches, even humans if they have the chance. Seal pups must socialize with other pups in order to learn important survival skills. Proper interaction with each other also ensures their ability to breed later on. But Hawaiian monk seals often come into contact with humans -- who either don\u2019t know better or don\u2019t care -- and who play with, feed or harass the seals. Feeding seals is the worst thing one can do for them, as they must learn to fend for themselves.5. Protected under the Endangered Species Act, harming a monk seal can result in a $50,000 fine and a one-year imprisonment. Admittedly, it\u2019s hard to leave the seal pups alone (they\u2019re adorable), but if monk seals don\u2019t learn to fear humans, they won\u2019t adjust properly to their wild existence. Which is what happened to Kamilo. Last week, he was seen following paddle boarders and swimming up to humans, who engaged with him. As Kamilo grew braver and more desensitized to humans, he began to follow two triathletes preparing for the Ironman World Championships. Attempting to engage in play, Kamilo circled and nipped both of them as they were swimming.6. According to NOAA scientist Charles Littnan, nipping, wrestling, scratching or biting are all \u201cplay behaviors.\u201d But Kamilo will grow to be 400 pounds, at which point his play won\u2019t be safe for humans or for him. After hearing of the bites, the Marine Mammal Center dispatched two biologists and a veterinarian to find Kamilo. He posed a danger to himself and others, and with 2,000 triathletes descending on his home waters for the weekend Ironman competition, time was of the essence.7. They kept Kamilo in a pen until it could be determined what would be best for him and for the monk seal population at large. The decision-making process was significantly hampered by the fact that the government shutdown meant NOAA workers were furloughed -- not even an official press release was written. The decision was complicated: too many humans were interacting with Kamilo on the Big Island. On the other hand, it was the only home he knew, and monk seals that had been relocated to far away islands had disappeared after their re-release. One seal got lost and swam hundreds of miles into the open ocean after being dropped off near a northwestern Hawaiian Island. So while scientists debated what to do, Kamilo waited.8. On the evening of Friday, Oct. 11, Kamilo was transported by plane and helicopter to his new home, the tiny island of Niihau near Kauai. Privately owned since 1864 and only 72 square miles in area, Niihau is sparsely populated by a native Hawaiian population and is not open to outside visitors. Kamilo\u2019s new home has between 50-100 monk seals, 16 of which are pups, which means his chances for socialization could be better than they were on Big Island. The hope is that Kamilo will be able to interact with other seal pups here, and to perhaps rest, away from the distractions of humans.Conservation efforts for Hawaiian monk seals continue through the NOAA, the California-based Marine Mammal Center, and the Hawaii-based Monk Seal Foundation. The Marine Mammal Center is attempting to finish a $3.2 million dollar project to build a hospital and rehabilitation center for Hawaiian monk seals on the Big Island. The Monk Seal Foundation continues its efforts toward seal conservation, promoting public education about monk seals and dispatching response teams to protect the seals whenever they come onto shore. To learn more about their efforts and find out how you can help, visit the Marine Mammal Center and Monk Seal Foundation websites.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Kamilo's removal from Big Island raised concerns about the genetic diversity of monk seals on the island. Though monk seals have the lowest genetic diversity of any large mammal studied to date, Kamilo's removal does not jeopardize the diversity of the monk seal population on Big Island."}, {"title": "'The Tipping Points,' New Weather Channel Series, Showcases Regions Altered By Warming Climate", "text": "From Mother Nature Network's Gerri Miller:There's a lot of scary Halloween programming this month, but a new Weather Channel series might be the most frightening of all. \u201cThe Tipping Points: 6 Places on Earth Where Climate\u2019s Changed\u201d is scary because it\u2019s real, showing what global warming will do to the planet if it proceeds at the current rate \u2014 starting with the Amazon rain forest, where drought, fires, changes in carbon dioxide, and loss of biodiversity due to climate change are converging with disastrous consequences.Premiering Oct. 19, the series is hosted by polar explorer, former rafting instructor, and climate journalist and lecturer Bernice Notenboom, who holds an MBA and a master's degree in geography and communications science and who hopes to reach a wider audience via television. \u201cOver the years I became more interested in reporting about climate change,\u201d she tells MNN. With 'Tipping Points,' \"My quest is to educate big audiences including children, businesses and general public.\"MNN: How did you become involved in the series? Bernice Notenboom: I met Liz Courtney of Unboxed Media in Toronto at the Planet in Focus film festival. A year later she called me and shared her idea about tipping points and asked me if I wanted to be involved. I had made films about climate change on the South Pole, Everest and in the desert of Mali before where we take extreme adventure, beautiful scenery and climate change in one package. Liz wanted to do a similar approach for \u201cTipping Points.\u201d The difference with this series is that we travel with scientists who are in the field doing their research; the scientists are the focus and there\u2019s less emphasis on the adventure part.Why and how were these six places chosen? We chose the locations based on Tim Lenton's theory of tipping points. He identified 12 tipping points, but phenomena's such as El Nino or the West African monsoon are difficult to visualize and to film. So we needed to focus on places where we can see the change and/or have scientists demonstrate what the change means if temperature continues to rise. Additionally, you need to be concerned about safety, ease of travel and the kind of adventure we can do with scientists to tell the story. The most important factor is to select locations where scientists are actively doing research relating to tipping points so we can travel with them and explain the causes that lead to changes in ecosystems due to climate change.The first episode is about the Amazon rain forest. How close to the tipping point is it there, and do you think it can recover? The Amazon has multiple threats which makes it complex to understand. Unlike ice \u2014 when temperatures increase it melts \u2014 the Amazon responds much slower to change. If drought hits the Amazon, it takes three years before you see trees responding. Deforestation is likely the biggest threat to the forests because it decreases rainfall and increases temperature. Big areas that have been cleared for agriculture and cattle are suffering from less precipitation and drought and are subject to fires. The Amazon is also sensitive to El Nino and La Nina and overall increase of temperature of the oceans. With each of them, there is simply more energy in the atmosphere due to evaporation but the rain ends up falling in the ocean and not on land, increasing drought cycles. The Amazon is also massive and straddles many countries. Brazil is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, whereas Peru and Ecuador are more influenced by the Pacific Ocean. This means that some parts of the Amazon suffer drought while other areas are flooding. Planting trees and saving the rain forest is the best we can do to prevent a tipping point of the forest despite the increasing economic interests.What other imperiled places are covered in the show? Where are they, and what are the specific global warming-created problems in each? The Greenland icecap: Here we see the icecap is suffering from surface melt with increasing air temperature. This melt creates lakes that fill up and drain when they become too full. This melt water runs through old crevasses to the bottom of the icecap where it hits the bedrock surface and drains to the ocean dumping cold fresh water into the ocean. Lack of sea ice in Greenland also let the glaciers flow more freely since it is missing its protection. Glaciers are accelerating and calve more rapidly. Soot is another issue in Greenland. This black substance, coming from industries far away, rains on the glaciers and speeds up the melt because it traps the heat.Permafrost above the Arctic Circle in Siberia, Canada and the United States is starting to thaw more rapidly. Warm polar air and cloudy nights trap heat in the atmosphere causing the permafrost to respond. When it thaws it can either release methane or carbon dioxide. Methane has 23 times more greenhouse gas than CO2, so if this thaws, we are creating a huge problem for ourselves and keeping global temperatures in check of 2 degrees becomes very unlikely.The big Southern Ocean is getting less salty and losing its capacity to absorb more CO2. Since oceans take in as much as 42 percent of CO2, we need the oceans to be cold, dense and salty. Oceans are also getting more acidic, which affects the health of marine wildlife and coral reefs. Inhabitants of Tuvalu are suffering from salty groundwater and crops become difficult to grow. Those people may be the first ones to qualify as climate refugees.In the Himalayas, the atmospheric brown cloud \u2014 pollution from coal fire power plants, diesel engines and burning wood \u2014 has created a cloud of three kilometers thick and is the size of the USA. This cloud spits soot on the glaciers (like Greenland) and hastens its melt. In the short term, there will be floods from melting glaciers, but then drought and lack of water will be the bigger issue. It will affect 3 billion people on Earth. This trapped heat of the cloud also has an impact on the Asian monsoon, which weakens its strength and brings less rains to the mountains and higher regions.Africa has multiple potential tipping points at once. Increasing temperatures in the Sahara and lack of rain stimulate sand storms and dust events shielding the atmosphere. The African monsoon becomes unpredictable, bringing too much rain or too little to the poor people, depending on rain in the Sahel countries.How severe are these problems and what is being done to counter them? What are some practical solutions? Thawing permafrost is the biggest threat to all of us globally. This may mean a temperature spike of 4 degrees if all the permafrost thaws. We now also discover that lack of sea ice in the polar region may alter and slow down our jet stream, which can get stuck and creates extreme weather events especially in the winter.The best thing we can do for our planet is to lower consumption and phase out of fossil fuels. This needs to happen on all levels: consumer, industries and in politics. Even the United Nations needs to get involved. Reducing our carbon footprint is such a humongous task and affects everyone; it is hard to say to someone in China or India he can't have the latest BMW model or vacation to a far away resort if this is their dream and they worked hard their entire lives to fulfill it. On the other hand, we have the technology and means to live more sustainably, but all we are lacking is the will power. Perhaps after a series of disasters, we will be forced to think differently. No matter what, it will be a huge price to pay and unfair to the people who had nothing to do with this.What things did you learn from your participation that you didn't know before? Did it reassure you or scare you? I didn't know the oceans play such a big role in the story of the tipping points. I knew that they are major engines for storing CO2 but subtle changes mean huge effects. It scares me to learn that the Great Southern Ocean is getting less salty and warmer, and that we know little about when this CO2 may get released back into the atmosphere when the oceans are becoming too saturated. I also feel confident we can fix the atmospheric brown cloud if we can get the pollution of diesel engines and cooking fires under control. Scientists say this may only take a year or less. The big question will be if it really helps the glaciers from melting too fast or if this will be too late once we get our act together.Do you hope it scares viewers and prompt action? How so? There is no doubt it will scare viewers; perhaps it scares them too much and they feel overwhelmed to do something. When I lecture I get the same response from the audience. We call this the prisoner\u2019s dilemma: We are in the same boat and there is nothing we can do individually that makes a difference therefore we do nothing. Our purpose is to tell the story of climate change with tipping points, not to lecture or provide a gloom and doom scenario but simply from the perspective of being informed. I think people will learn in this series and being informed motivates you to take action. A common response is that \"we know what climate change is, heard it all before,\" but to me this is where we can really make a difference because our series shows that scientists are frantically trying to find answers to new climate issues and the science of tipping points makes it so interesting.What is the overall takeaway from this series? I hope that people understand more about the science and what the scientists are actually doing in the field to understand the changes. Unfortunately, we are just at the base of understanding what some of these tipping elements mean and how they relate to each other. Research is expensive, and the locations remote and lots more research needs to happen. Climate change in the USA seems to be still a matter of belief, not with facts. What we hope to prove with this series is that this is happening to our planet and the scientists are proving it. Living for so long in a wilderness setting makes me appreciate nature even more, and I believe this is my personal premise to set out and educate people to protect this incredible planet we live on."}, {"title": "Wien Wins It!

Somewhere in the midst of this guilty pleasure, Carrie or one of the other girls (I can't be sure -- it was 3 a.m.) opined that we might all be better off if we didn't bring so many expectations into our relationships. Naturally, this made me think of dogs.In some cases, strict requirements are understandable. Nancy, a trainer, got a dog specifically to do agility. An experienced competitor, she has a high skill level and knows what types of dogs excel at the sport. Not only did the dog have to be nimble and built for speed, but he also had to have certain traits including the ability to focus and the strong motivation that's often referred to as drive. On the other hand, Sue, a retired woman in her late sixties, spends most of her time at home and wanted a dog for company. She didn't care much what the dog looked like, or even the breed or age. She just wanted a smallish dog who would cuddle with her at night and not need too much exercise during the day. Nancy's final choice of a young, intense border collie would not have made Sue any happier than Sue's eventual adoptee, a sweet, calm, mixed breed senior, would have made Nancy.For Nancy and Sue, the dogs really did need to meet specific expectations. But most adopters, whether an individual or a family, are simply looking for a dog to fit into their homes and lives without too much trouble. They typically envision an affectionate dog who's fairly easy to train, won't make major demands on their lifestyle, and is friendly with the family and visitors. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, really, who goes looking for a dog with baggage? Who wants a long-term project? Regardless, sometimes that's exactly what happens.My own dogs are both shelter rescues we adopted a few months apart. You might think I wouldn't care much whether a dog has major issues, since as a trainer and behavior specialist, I know how to fix them. Wrong! Even professionals need a break now and then. My last two dogs were much loved but had their own issues -- one with fear and the other, aggression -- and I longed for an easier dog. As it turned out, Sierra, who came to us at around age two, had a wicked case of separation anxiety. Bodhi, who was allegedly two but turned out to be closer to one, was steeped in the hormones and outrageous behavior of adolescence. He was a handful and a half; rowdy, destructive, reactive toward other dogs, no manners... I could go on. Suffice it to say that despite careful screening (I still believe that he walked quietly past other dogs during his in-shelter temperament test chanting, I will hold it together until I get adopted, I will...) neither dog turned out to be quite what I was expecting. Working through their issues was challenging at times, but eventually, things resolved. Are they absolutely perfect now? Nope. Who is? Still, I wouldn't trade either of them for the world.So what can you do if your dog turns out to be very different than what you were hoping? First, unless you're an experienced trainer yourself, hire one. (The Association of Professional Dog Trainers' website is a great place to start your search.) Unless there's an issue such as major aggression toward a child or some other deal-breaker, be patient and work at it. In the end, sometimes the best course is to change what you can, and then accept and appreciate the being for who he is. I'm sure Carrie Bradshaw would agree.Follow Nicole Wilde on Facebook: www.facebook.com/NicoleWildeAuthor"}, {"title": "Chaos in the Oceans", "text": "I was born into a family that owned a few acres of land. Indeed, I believe the ownership of tiny to small property is beneficial to individual and public well-being.But I still don't understand how American farmers can own, sometimes, hundreds of thousands of acres of land. I was astonished when I \"discovered\" that one could even own mountains in the United States.It's this misuse of the idea of personal power and its imposition on things that humans never made or can make -- air, land, water and the natural world -- which is partly responsible for our existential crisis.The orgy of the \"private\" has all but crushed the public good: that working together and sharing provide the cornerstones of democracy and civilization.Capitalists see the natural world as a mine for plunder. This is particularly true in the vast oceans where armies of pirates (companies, individuals, and governments) invade them daily and grab \"resources.\"Petroleum companies drill the ocean floor for oil and natural gas, leaving behind them deleterious pollution; commercial fishing factories scoop fish like they are endless, spreading death and destruction; countless \"pleasure\" yachts leave a trail of toxic chemicals in the water; governments even use the oceans for dumping hazardous wastes; and rivers disgorge fertilizers, pesticides and other poisonous wastes into the seas and oceans.The result of this criminal behavior is fueling large dead zones in the water and risking life in the seas and oceans. Indeed, the human cannibalism of the oceans is setting a deleterious chain reaction with no end in sight.Anthropogenic global warming is one of the drivers of this process, making it more deadly.First, the human poisoning and exploitation of our water world is consuming myriads of species of fish and other wildlife, altering the chemistry and biology of what makes life possible not merely within the oceans but on the rest of the Earth.A symptom of this tragic human impact on the life of the oceans is the reemergence from obscurity of the jellyfish as a dominant species, a position it occupied half a billion years ago before the existence of fish, mammals and turtles.The Australian jellyfish expert, Lisa-ann Gershwin, tells the story of jellyfish and human plunder of the oceans in Stung! (University of Chicago Press, 2013). Stung! evokes the danger of jellyfish blooms but, even more fundamentally, it is about the real stung effect of the collapsing oceans. \"Stung!\" is extremely important, well written and well documented.Gershwin gives voice to the best scientists speaking about their life-long concerns on the fate of the oceans, quoting them on the dreadful effects of industrialized fishing, mining of the seas, global warming, and pollution: how \"economic\" activities since 1960 have reduced the fish by 90 percent, disrupt ecosystems, making the future of coral reefs bleak, and raising the temperature of the seas to the point that phytoplankton, the basic stuff of like in the oceans, favors the jellyfish over the fish.The health of the oceans is fundamental to the health of all living beings on the planet. The oceans produce most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, absorb huge amounts of the Earth-warming gases, moderate the whether, climate and temperature, and fix planetary chemistry. They are also home to a tremendous variety of animals and plants.\"If the ocean is in trouble - and it is - we are in trouble.,\" wrote the distinguished planetary scientist, Sylvia Earle, in the foreword of Stung!Stung! shows the oceans are in deep trouble. In addition to polluters, the other beneficiaries of the human poisoning of the oceans are the jellyfish. They \"decimate fisheries and alter ecosystems,\" Gershwin wrote. She documents why the jellyfish are the harbingers of marine chaos: thriving in warmer waters, slowly taking over the oceans.\"As seas become stressed, the jellyfish are there, like an eagle to an injured lamb... We are increasingly fishing out their predators and competitors, and we are altering the physical properties of the seabed and chemical properties of the oceans to favor the jellyfish,\" wrote Gershwin.In contrast to Earle who says humans can \"restore and protect the ocean systems vital to our survival and well-being,\" Gershwin says \"its too late.\" The oceans, she writes, are like people with terminal cancer.Gershwin's conclusion is wrong. It is not based on the science she used in writing her book. The oceans are too large and too complex to declare them dead. The oceans don't have cancer. Humans degrade the oceans and humans can let them heal themselves.Saying \"it's too late\" sends the polluters an unspoken message to continue with their deadly work. That is unacceptable.A telling message should be to stop trashing the oceans. Bring to an end the violence, enormous take, and waste of industrialized fishing. Gershwin cites the Canadian scientist Daniel Pauly who equates industrialized fishing to a war of extermination. Such behavior ought to be outlawed.Second, control pollution. Given time without the violence of human intrusion, the oceans will recover.Let the public good and nature triumph over private greed."}, {"title": "Kale Chips for 8,000 and Other Farm-to-school Successes by the Numbers", "text": "October is Farm to School Month, October 14-18 is National School Lunch Week, and Oct. 24 is Food Day. This trifecta of real food deliciousness benefits everyone: The farmers and ranchers who grow food for local districts, school nutrition directors who know exactly where their food comes from, and -- most of all -- millions of students who enjoy fresh food right on their school trays.The three pillars of a sustainable farm to school program are generally seen as Cafeteria, Classroom and Community. But there is fourth, equally important C -- Champions! Successful farm to school programs are started, nurtured and harvested by champions at every step from the field to table. Here's how three directors -- three very cool school lunch dudes -- from Maine to Montana are growing impressive farm to school numbers.Thanks to Nutrition Services director Tyler Goodwin, students in the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District on the coast of southern Maine have a personal relationship produce on their lunch trays. It comes from the Spiller Farm, just two miles down the road and students help to pick it, clean it and prepare it. During September trips to the farm, hundreds of school kids picked 15 bushels (450 pounds) of green beans, 18 bushels (900 pounds) of red potatoes and 15 bushels (720 pounds) of apples (enough to supply the entire District for the next several months).Last week, Chef Tyler froze 10 bushels of carrots, also picked by student helpers. The final yield was 450 pounds of freshly picked, lightly steamed, very local frozen carrots for winter meals like veggie stir-fry, peas-n-carrots and candied carrots. Total time from field to freezer was less than four days, with a substantial decrease in overall carbon footprint. The environmental impact is important to the district's Green Team, headed by 7th grade science teacher Saul Lindauer. The team is learning about and working to support centuries of farming heritage in Wells. According to Goodwin, fresh local produce makes a real difference in cafeterias too. \"What I have noticed in all schools is healthier choices being made, kids are automatically selecting the required fruit or vegetable with lunch, and less waste than last year,\" he reports.Deep in the apple orchards of Central Michigan, Dan Gorman, Food Service Director in Montague/Whitehall Schools is focused on some big farm to school numbers too -- world record numbers in this case! On Oct. 24, he and the districts' 4,000 students -- plus at least 14,000 more in Muskegon County -- will try to regain the Guinness World Record for the \"most people simultaneously eating an apple at one time.\" Muskegon County held the world record (9,329) until last May when children in New Zealand schools upped it to 17,064 with the help of an apple company.Promoting healthy snacking, supporting local agriculture and generating record-breaking excitement are just some of Dan's everyday efforts to bring fresh, local food to kids. When he switched the district's milk contract to a local dairy that raises its own cows and crops, the farm was able to hire four new workers. In the elementary cafeterias, monthly Harvest Days highlight Michigan fruits, vegetables and herbs. Students get to touch, smell and taste fresh items with their lunch, guided by an adult community member or high school mentor. As chair of the 1 in 21 Education Committee, Gorman is -- as always -- focused on a much bigger goal. \"Going for a world record is as American as apple pie, but the more important goal is making Muskegon county the healthiest county in Michigan by 2021,\" he says.Now, about the kale chips for 8,000: It happened for the second time on Oct. 2, 2013, to celebrate National Kale Day in Missoula County Public Schools, Montana. Last year, on a 'dare' from Jason Mandela of the PEAS (Program in Ecological Agriculture and Society) Farm, Food and Nutrition Supervisor Ed Christensen offered baked kale chips to every student in the district. While not shy about saying his kale chips are \"the best,\" Ed was impressed by how much the kids liked them. \"It's really pretty simple,\" he says. \"We use freshly picked kale, toss it with oil, sprinkle with a little salt, and bake slowly.\" While olive oil adds nutty flavor and USDA commodity oil works fine, Christensen also likes to use Montana-grown safflower on his kale chips.Kale is big on Christensen's local veggie list because it's so hardy, often the last thing harvested from the PEAS Farm. Chips are a great way to serve kale because they are like potato chips to kids. On a recent 'smack down' with a tasty raw kale salad, the crunchy chips won hands down. During this year's Kale-abration, Ed saw savvy 3rd graders crushing the chips onto their pizza. About that pizza, the crust is 100 percent scratch, whole grain made with local Wheat Montana Prairie Gold flour and turkey pepperoni. Missoula schools are currently developing a scratch sauce to incorporate house-grown onions and herbs. Clearly Ed wants to do farm to school as many ways as possible -- in a place with a growing season of about four months!!Being a school nutrition director is a tough enough job without adding all the extra details of a farm to school program. Despite the demands, thousands of directors across the U.S. have stepped up to the plate -- or lunch tray -- to do what Tyler, Dan and Ed do in their districts. Why? So students can have the freshest, best tasting, most nutritious meals possible and be fit, well-nourished and ready to succeed."}, {"title": "Angry Elk Chases Motorcyclists (VIDEO)", "text": "When Heather Leigh and her boyfriend Glen decided to take a motorcycle ride through Montana, they were not expecting to be chased by an elk.According to the video description, Heather says that the elk appeared to be aggravated, and she was surprised when it began to follow them. \"I told Glen to lose it.

Ikea may be a leader in renewable energy for its own operations, with more than half a million solar panels installed on its store and factory roofs and a fleet of its own wind turbines. But solar power for its customers?  From a business perspective, it makes little sense. Margins on solar panels are very thin, especially at Ikea's prices. And this year, with China suppliers awash in panel inventory, wholesale panel prices have been extraordinarily low.  Ikea's one-year pilot project at its Lakeside UK store near London sold \"one photovoltaic (PV) system almost every day.\" They're not running out the door, despite generous government incentives in the UK.  PV systems require a new business model for Ikea entailing home installation and maintenance services. Ikea's panel supplier is Hanergy Holding Group Ltd, a privately-held Chinese company whose panels may be subject to \"quality, environmental, after-sale service and product warranty concerns.\"   If Ikea decides to roll out its solar panel program in the U.S., it will face competition from stores experienced in home installations such as Lowes and Home Depot, which has been advertising and installing solar panels since 2005 through its partnership with BP.One wonders how quickly Ikea franchise owners outside the UK will take on the reputational risk of the solar panel business.  There are plenty of potential problems with Ikea's solar panel business. But from a branding perspective, it makes total sense. As early as 2003, culture watchers, environmentalists and even designers have found fault with the underlying ethic of Ikea's approach. In a short piece on ethics in graphic design, Ikea is charged with designing its products with planned obsolescence in mind. In 2009, Salon reviewed Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture, Ellen Ruppel Shell's criticism of our cycle of consumption that is destroying the environment and harming labor as well. Focused on discount chains like Wal-Mart and Target, Shell \"gently damns\" Ikea for its cheap, disposable products that are as bad for the environment as Wal-Mart's. The environmental blog along the trail aptly called Ikea \"consumerism on steroids.\"A recent glance at Ikea's U.S. consumer web site reinforces this idea: most of the site's new offerings are doo-dads and children's toys.  Now, with its solar offerings, negative impressions associated with Ikea's disposable \"stuff\" could be tempered by solar panels in the stores. The company's 2012 Yearly Summary launched its campaign of \"People & Planet Positive.\" But the greenwashing of the last two decades has put consumers on alert to eco claims that are mere promotion. Ikea's success with solar panels to generate energy for its own use has been much ballyhooed. Solar for consumers is its next big chance to reinforce its good guy mantle.  Not a moment too soon. A just-released study by BBMG, GlobeScan and SustainAbility found that\"...the sustainability proposition has changed from being the 'right thing to do' to being the 'cool thing to do'. ...For decades, green marketers have been speaking to the wrong consumers, assuming that by engaging the most committed 'advocates' we would create significant business growth, cultural relevance and change at scale. What makes Aspirationals so compelling is that they combine an authentic commitment to sustainability with a love of shopping, design and social status, aligning economic, cultural and social forces to shift the way we shop.\"For consumers, Ikea's long-admired design sensibility is intertwined with its sustainability. The chain's commitment to affordability doesn't have to fight with perceptions of sustainability. But Ikea must tread very carefully to preserve all three. A potential money-loser like solar panels could boost its environmental reputation and enhance its brand's coolness. After all, the announcement about its UK stores carrying solar panels was carried widely across U.S. consumer, environmental and business media. So far, it looks like a branding home run."}, {"title": "Thousands Of Cattle Dead After Freak Winter Storm In South Dakota", "text": "By Carey GillamOct 14 (Reuters) - The storm was just so sudden, South Dakota cattle rancher Kathy Jobgen remembers.A freezing rain, followed by an avalanche of four feet of snow and winds of 70 miles an hour, hit thousands of cattle still grazing on \"summer pastures\" at a time when the animals had not yet grown their protective winter coats and were ill prepared for the harsh conditions.Swirling snow lodged in some of the animals' lungs, suffocating them. Hypothermia killed more. And others were caught in gullies, or plunged off slickened rock ledges, livestock experts said.\"I've been in this business 50 years and I've never seen anything like this,\" said Jobgen, who estimated her family lost nearly half of its herd of 350 when the storm swept through Oct. 3-5. \"The vision of seeing all these cattle dead is something you can't wipe out of our eyes.\"South Dakota had the sixth-largest cattle herd in the United States with some 3.85 million head in January 2013, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Most of those are in the western part of the state, where the storm struck, leaving carcasses strewn on the Plains and hitting ranchers with tens of millions of dollars in losses.Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota state veterinarian, said reports to his office so far total about 3,300 head of cattle dead. But he estimates the number will eventually reach 20,000.\"It really is going to take a hit on the industry here,\" Oedekoven said.South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard on Friday issued an executive order allowing truckers carrying cattle carcasses in the state to exceed normal weight limits to help expedite removal of the dead animals.\"The weekend blizzard already has caused untold devastation,\" the governor said in a statement. \"The number of livestock actually lost in the storm isn't certain, but it will range in the thousands of head.\"Ranchers are both trying to bury animals and haul them to roadways where renderers will remove the bodies. But while the snow melt has allowed for roadways to be cleared, the pastures in many areas are flooded or too muddy to access, making it hard to collect carcasses and to care for surviving animals.Silvia Christen, executive director of the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, said most cattle ranchers do not carry private insurance policies because they are cost prohibitive and have exclusions that would have ruled out coverage in this situation anyway.She said the ranchers' only financial assistance would be found in a disaster program that is part of a proposed U.S. farm bill. But the U.S. government shutdown and delays in passing a new farm bill have left ranchers with no assistance.Ranchers are not able to even consult with their U.S. Farm Service Agency representatives on how to document their cattle losses, since the FSA workers are on furlough because of the shutdown, she said.Christen said each calf lost has a market value of roughly $800-$900 and each cow is valued at about $1,800, so the total losses could easily be in the tens of millions of dollars.\"This is a major financial loss for these ranchers,\" she said. As well, she said, the emotional loss has been wrenching.\"The ranchers care deeply for these animals. To find so many of them have perished in this storm is really emotionally devastating,\" she said.The South Dakota disaster could compound an already tight U.S. cattle supply situation in the spring, which could keep beef prices at or near record levels, Chicago Mercantile Exchange livestock traders said on Monday.The spring is when a lot of the calves that were lost would have come to market. That is likely to help put a floor beneath prices for April 2014 delivery of feeder cattle. The April contract settled on Monday at 135.650 cents per pound, up 0.375 cent.U.S. Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, has been urging Congress to reopen the government so livestock disaster aid programs can move forward. Johnson's spokesman, Perry Plumart, said Monday that the senator's office has been in touch with ranchers from around the state and heard losses as high as 80,000 animals.Gary Cammack, a rancher from Union Center, South Dakota, who runs about 500 cows on 10,000 acres, said the suddenness and severity of the storm caught everyone off guard. So far, Cammack and his family have counted about 120 animals dead.\"Within 24 hours after the storm broke, we knew it was going to be bad. When we went out looking for them, there were cattle stacked up in every fence corner. They just gave up and died there,\" said Cammack.

But it gets even harder when fields flood with salt water.Stretching east of New Haven, the Connecticut shoreline follows the Long Island Sound in a bucolic tract of almost continuous salt marsh. Land and sea wend their way among inlets and islands, necks and coves that stretch all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.For centuries this meeting of earth and water has been fertile farmland for the local inhabitants, yielding harvests from shellfish to salt hay. But like most ecosystems, it requires balance. Today, the farms and marsh are threatened, in danger of drowning under the siege of uncontrolled tides and inept government.European settlers farming in the 17th century built dykes, jetties and berms to control the flow of water during high tides and storms. These systems protected houses and farms from hurricanes and high perigee tides (when the moon is closest to the earth) that periodically inundate the land. Floodgates and flapper valves let the waters in and out as needed. Salt hay was mowed when the fields were dry.Later, the greater marshland came under the control of governmental agencies like the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) who, together with the locals, managed floodwaters. Their involvement also included environmental controls such as releasing killifish into the marshes, which eat mosquito larvae.Of the many indigenous gifts of salt marshes, salt hay is one of the finest. Due to its saline coating, it is free of weed seed, unlike other hays. This makes it a highly valued crop; it has been shipped from the shoreline as far as Canada. Along with being a good insulator for ice, it is prized for mulching, especially for delicate crops like strawberries. Up until twenty years ago the Leete family, whose first Branford farm dates to 1639, produced 1100 bales of salt hay a season, which sells for $12 a bale.But like much of the natural environment, salt hay is finicky and only thrives under certain conditions. It likes a tidal habitat where the water recedes every twelve hours, letting the grasses dry out. These days the Leete salt marsh is flooded all the time, even at low tide. The constant high water is killing the plant, rotting the roots, and on a warm day it stinks of decaying vegetable matter.What causes rising waters is disputed- the melting of the polar ice caps, ocean surges due to climate change, or the shift in the Gulf Stream towards the eastern seaboard. But what's not in question is that the waters are rising: ask anyone who has lived a life close to the Connecticut shoreline and they will tell you tides are higher than before. Bill Leete, born in 1940, showed me a stone pier that was always at least a foot out of the water when he was a kid. Now the waves break over it at high tide. Out on the Thimble Islands that sit offshore, many docks have required raising to keep them out of the water.Farming with these slowly rising waters was manageable with the old dykes- their simple systems were effective. That is, while they were maintained. But in an unfortunate dovetailed timing, the higher waters have arrived at the same time that governmental regulators have abandoned tide controls. Maintenance has eroded, taking the salt marsh with it.Ironically, the very agencies that are avowedly dedicated to environmental protection, like the DEEP and the land trusts, have contributed to destabilizing the salt marsh. Dykes have not been repaired, and in some cases, floodgates and berms have been deliberately removed, causing an abrupt change to the water levels at such a fast rate, the marsh is not able to adjust.With the incoming tide, water rushes through the unchecked dykes in a torrent. Pressure from the sea forces the water into the marshes, but there is no corresponding pressure to carry it out. The excessively high waters have affected not just the salt marsh, but the entire surrounding community- the tidal fields, the farms, the houses, the roads.Down Route 146 from the Leete's, Jay Medlyn grows organic vegetables on his small family farm begun in 1880. People drive for miles to buy his tasty tomatoes. Since the berm that restrained the tides was removed, Medlyn has lost a foot of topsoil and acres of pumpkin and corn to salt water. After the erosion from storms Sandy and Irene, the higher salt water has seeped into his reservoir, leaving him no fresh water for crops or livestock.Trees around the marshes are dying, unable to cope with the salt water. People who live near the marsh have lost their septic drainage and their fresh water wells. Sections of Route 146, a state road that carries local shoreline traffic, are flooded at high tide. Branford First Selectman Unk DaRoss points out that the state road was not built at the high water mark.Local residents, dependent on a stable environment to protect their land and livelihood, repeatedly appeal to the state agencies for help in maintaining the controls that worked for hundreds of years. The agencies send groups of bureaucrats to look at the problem. Scuba divers investigate. Engineers evaluate. Notes are taken. At one point they came up with a plan and asked the farmers for approval, but by the time all the forms were filled out and licenses granted, the state money had been spent elsewhere.Whatever the multiple causes, the challenge of maintaining balance under changing conditions has not been met. Governmental agencies with a mandate to preserve and promote marsh restoration have been negligent in ignoring the repercussions of uncontrolled waters. Before more homes are lost and more farming curtailed, surely they should consult with the people who live and work on this fragile land; they are part of the environment, too.Jay Medlyn observing incoming tidal waters at broken Jervis Creek dam.

The more these words get used, the larger or more diffuse their inclusive meanings. At a recent maritime heritage meeting, a Swedish historian was discussing his definition of globalization, and asked the audience if we felt that this was only a modern phenomenon, not a function of history. A Dutch respondent stated emphatically no, it was not historical, it was instead a modern invention of technology and political circumstance. He was so certain.But is he correct? It seems to me that globalization began the first time any intrepid sailor left the security of land for an unknown ocean destination, Phoenician, Viking, Polynesian, Asian, no matter where or when the reality of departure defined the expectation of arrival, even if there were only stars to guide the way. If the Phoenicians initiated what became ship borne trade routes, if the Vikings came ashore at L'Anse aux Meadows in the Americas, they and their global counterparts began the system of connection that now binds the continents and nations in a net of exchange and financial transaction that we call \"globalization.\"Are there other maritime tipping points that we can cite to counter our assertive Dutchman? Well, let's start with the very familiar steam engine, with its early application on the water and its ensuing revolution of ship technology and construction that exploited existing connection radically and transformed global capacity for types of products and volumes transported, underlies the dramatic expansion of immigration the world over, and transformed exploration and naval warfare into a resultant phenomenon called \"empire.\"A second maritime example is the undersea cable. Many people understand the facility of global communications to be a function of satellites, but in fact it is primarily sustained by yet another network, albeit invisible on the ocean floor, that connects the continents and has developed from early telephone connection to vast data transfer capacity that underlies up-to-the-minute information exchange, market trading, and internet-based communications such as email and social media.A third example is global positioning technology, this time satellite based, but essential to modern marine navigation, location services for trade goods and shipping containers, and real-time recording of ocean data collection, sampling, research experiment, weather prediction, underwater exploration and mapping, and navigation of underwater vehicles be they submarines, research submersibles (manned or remotely operated), or free swimming drones or robots.All these ocean-based functions are definite contributing factors over time to our globalized world. There are certainly other historical examples, just as there are new manifestations to come. What might we imagine for the future?Here's a surprising thought to consider: unlike any other place on earth, a vast portion of the ocean remains outside the limits of national jurisdiction, the 15 to 200 mile territorial extension of proprietary rights that frequently overlap. The Mediterranean for example, is an impossible scribble of claims on maps and conflicting national policies that cry out for new forms of social communication, consensus agreement, jurisdictional negotiation, and successful tools for governance. The open ocean is less complicated, but as an enormous area, inclusive of a magnitude of political aspirations, natural resource values, and sources of conflict, remains nonetheless a unique and unresolved component of the globalizing world. Successful adjudication of this situation stands as an essential challenge to equitable resolution of the circumstances, demanding for success significant review and reconsideration of values and strategies different from the conventional approaches which have not even served the alongshore reality well.We return to terminology, to globalization and sustainability. It does not necessarily follow that globalization is a counter-force to sustainability even if many might claim that the demanding integration of worldwide need for goods and services lies at the root of the apparently insatiable consumption-based attack on environmental conservation and sustainability on land and sea. But if, as we face the pressure of some final approach for governance of the ocean outside national jurisdiction, if we face this as an opportunity to rectify and define our response the value of the commons, then we may achieve yet another tipping point whereby maritime enterprise and ocean resources show us the way forward to a viable future."}, {"title": "The Arab Oil Embargo, Sandy, and Adapting to New Realities", "text": "This month marks the anniversaries of two notable events, decades apart yet related in terms of historical impact, awareness of vulnerability, and challenge to business as usual: the Arab oil embargo 40 years ago (Oct. 16, 1973) and Superstorm Sandy, which hit the Northeast on Oct. 29 last year. Both events sparked a national and global focus on two concepts I've been hearing quite a bit about in recent months: adaptation and resilience.Much is being written and said about the oil embargo anniversary - one event on Oct. 16 features two former Secretaries of State, two ex-Secretaries of Defense, and the CEOs of GE, GM, FedEx, and Waste Management. The United States, of course, still depends on imported oil, but we have made notable recent progress (after decades of very little) on vehicle fuel efficiency. The administration's aggressive CAFE standards, with a mandated fleet average of 54.5 mpg by 2025, are arguably President Obama's signature achievement on climate action to date, and both hybrid and electric cars have good market momentum. It would make for an interesting debate, but I would argue that the U.S. auto industry and its regulators have done more to adapt to new market realities than most U.S. electric utilities.As the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) annual meeting convened in New York City in late September, it seemed a fitting symbol when the failure of a Con Edison feeder cable shut down service on one of the nation's busiest commuter rail lines, Metro-North's New Haven Line between New Haven, Connecticut and Grand Central Station. This occurred as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others were discussing the need for resilient cities with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at CGI.Full train service wasn't restored for 12 days, costing the Connecticut economy an estimated $62 million. The Metro-North debacle was obviously not climate-related - and was not a failure of the overall grid per se - but that didn't matter to tens of thousands of frustrated commuters. And it symbolizes the challenge of how best to generate and distribute electric power in the 21st century - whether to a rail line, a manufacturing plant, or an urban neighborhood.Connecticut officials, according to the Hartford Courant, are taking another look at a fuel cell-powered microgrid as an alternative to grid power from Con Ed, an option first studied in 2007. If that happens, Metro-North will actually be returning to its historical roots. Then known as the New Haven Railroad, the line was the first in the U.S. to be powered by a dedicated generation plant, the Cos Cob Power Station, built by the railroad and Westinghouse Electric to replace steam locomotives. That happened in 1908.The Metro-North power outage is merely one recent example of the unprecedented challenges being faced by traditional, centralized utilities. Microgrids, distributed solar, data-empowered customers, grid storage mandates in places like California, and many other factors are challenging business as usual as never before, for utilities, regulators, and policymakers. They also have to deal with RPS mandates for renewable power in many states, but those are generally met with large-scale wind, geothermal, and biomass plants (and occasional utility-scale solar) that may shift power sources but don't have to challenge centralized business models.The distributed energy revolution is arguably clean tech's front-and-center issue of 2013. From SolarCity's rapid growth (the firm now expects its distributed PV installations to nearly double next year) to the smart thermostats from Global Cleantech 100 North America \"Company of the Year\" Nest Labs, all trends point to more and more electricity that is generated and/or managed at or very near the point of its use. In the face of all this, many (though certainly not all) utilities cling to the centralized, command-and-control paradigm that they've perfected over more than a century.\"If Thomas Edison came back today, he'd know exactly how everything works,\" said Robyn Beavers, senior VP of NRG Energy and founder of NRG's San Francisco-based \"Station A\" innovation unit, at the recent SXSW Eco conference in Austin, Texas. \"We're looking at the disruption of longtime models of generation, distribution and usage. It's overwhelming and it's daunting - but it's time.\"For utilities, adapting to the new realities of distributed energy will also help bring adaptation and resilience in the face of climate-related power disruptions. To date, many utilities, including some large investor-owned entities like Edison International and Xcel, are doing a pretty good job of this. But many others are not, digging in their heels against net metering and other distributed generation-friendly policies. Another speaker at SXSW Eco, Kate Gordon of Tom Steyer's clean-energy advocacy group Next Generation, suggests they take a lesson from another well-established, entrenched but challenged U.S. industry based in Detroit.\"I'm from the Midwest,\" Gordon said, \"and I spent years watching the auto companies saying how they owned the market and didn't need to change. Now, they're seeing how strong fuel-economy standards might be a good thing and building cars accordingly. Utilities are getting there, but they need to see that their backs are up against the wall; they can't maintain their market share. Innovative utilities will move ahead - non-innovative utilities will be in trouble.\" In industry after industry, that history lesson is always worth learning."}, {"title": "Chevron Ecuador Case Shows Limits of Legal System", "text": "Nothing better demonstrates how ineffective the judiciary can be at righting wrongs than the $19 billion legal battle over Texaco's massive oil contamination of the Ecuadorian rainforest from 1964 to 1990.Since 1993, at least two dozen courts in five countries have heard evidence about the case. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, has hired more than 2,000 lawyers to defend itself and doesn't dispute an estimated $1 billion legal tab between the two companies.With yet another trial starting this week in a New York federal court, it appears that no court is capable of delivering justice to the people who deserve it -- the 30,000 indigenous people and poor farmers who live in the communities devastated by Texaco's deliberate contamination of their water and soil.As the former U.S. spokesperson for the Ecuadorians who sued Texaco, I held out hope for the five years that I worked for them that a judicial ruling would result in an environmental remediation, clean water and medical facilities for the Ecuadorians who have suffered from illnesses, lost family and friends to cancer and continue to live with the environmental impacts of ongoing pollution.The blame, though, doesn't just rest at Chevron's feet. There's plenty to go around.The lawsuit has become a conglomerate of lawyers looking for courtroom advantage instead of justice and a magnification of everything that is wrong with the law and that which often revolves around it, including a deployment of lobbyists and media consultants for the spillover fight outside the courtroom. I was one of those media consultants.Now comes Chevron in a U.S. court charging that it should not have to pay a $19 billion judgment that the Ecuador courts have awarded because it is the real victim; a victim of fraud.It's taken 20 years, but we have come full circle, landing back in the same U.S. court that sent the case to Ecuador in the first place.Chevron maintains its allegations of fraud are serious but the Ecuadorians also have compelling evidence of fraud on two continents by the oil giant. Both sides have detailed answers to each and every allegation. It just so happens that the U.S. judge, hearing the fraud case, isn't interested in the Ecuadorians' charges against Chevron, and there is no doubt he will rule in the oil giant's favor.While thousands of facts are in dispute, some are not. The most conservative review of the record would find that:Once in Ecuador, the game got played the way it sometimes gets played in courtrooms across the globe, even in the U.S., with parties on both sides pushing the legal envelope. Take a close look at the record and you'll find plenty of questionable tactics undertaken by the lawyers for the Ecuadorians and for Texaco/Chevron.Would the theatrics been any different if the lawsuit had been litigated in the U.S.? Who knows? The fact is it wasn't. And, as much as Chevron hates this fact, Ecuador law applies in all of its strengths and weaknesses, something that the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear the inevitable appeal of the federal court's fraud ruling, has noted.Meanwhile, similar abuses of the environment and native cultures by multinational corporations plague many other developing countries today. (Some would argue, right here in the United States.) It goes without saying that the indigenous and the poor who bear the brunt of such abuses, however, should not look to the Ecuador litigation for inspiration and guidance.They will be well served to remember that the scales of justice are weighted toward those with the most wealth to fund the most sophisticated legal team.A fraud conviction against the Ecuadorian attorneys will not exonerate the oil giant for its deliberate actions that have resulted in the devastation of indigenous cultures, untold deaths and illnesses. But it will mean that justice for the Ecuadorians still remains years away from any finality. Their lawyers will appeal a fraud conviction in the U.S. and will continue to fight for enforcement of the $19 billion Ecuador judgment in countries where Chevron has assets: Argentina, Brazil, and Canada.After 20 years of litigation in courts around the globe, the Ecuadorians remain twice victimized -- first by the exploitation of their environment, and now by the exploitation by both sides of a legal system ill equipped to deliver them justice._____Disclosure: I work pro-bono for a group of indigenous Ecuadorians and their U.S. legal adviser, Steven Donziger, to help hold Chevron accountable for one of the world's largest environmental disasters in the Amazon rainforest.

Nothing is getting out of the initial area,\" said Kris Roberts, who leads the environmental response team at the North Dakota Department of Health.The pipeline runs 35 miles from Tioga to Black Slough in North Dakota and was built by BP Plc in 1993.

Such reportage was unparalleled especially in comparison to the reporting around the massive super cyclone that hit the same region in 1999. Twenty-four-hour broadcasting ensured the cyclone's landfall made it to TV screens at the same instant as it ravaged through villages and towns in India.Even with all the technology and the TRP buzz, one vital issue has remained out of discussion so far and that is the elephant in the room, global warming. I've been chided several times by reputed individuals in the field of science to not connect any single weather event to climate change and rightly so, it's simply not scientific to beat the climate change drum for my campaigning cause. But when these very scientists, the whole 800 of them, unequivocally state that extreme weather events are on the rise and countries like India are highly vulnerable, I find it counterproductive to not connect the dots from cyclone Phailin to climate change.Let's take a brief look at the science. Cyclones are low pressure systems that form over warm tropical oceans. They derive energy from the warmer waters and do not form unless the temperatures are over 26.5 degrees Celsius. The recorded temperature in the Bay of Bengal where Phailin developed was 28-29 degrees Celsius with very high heat content. The sea surface temperature variations over the past few decades in the Bay of Bengal show an increasing trend, more particularly pronounced since 1992. According to Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog: \"In fact, twenty-six of the thirty-five deadliest tropical cyclones in world history have been Bay of Bengal storms. During the past two centuries, 42 percent of Earth's tropical cyclone-associated deaths have occurred in Bangladesh, and 27 percent have occurred in India.\"The Overseas Development Institute (ODI), an influential think tank stated in its new report titled \"Geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\" that India ranks highest in its risk to extreme weather disasters\":\"Over the two decades many parts of India -- including Andhra Pradesh -- will be increasingly exposed to disasters. The focus on how deadly disasters can be should not obscure the fact that many homes, hospitals, shops and schools will have been badly impacted in ways which will drive people into poverty, said Dr. Tom Mitchell from ODI.\"Climate change is as much about politics as it is about science and to act on it would require political mobilization preceded by a greater public demand to acknowledge and act on this clear and present danger.India's response to Phailin has been commendable. Over 800,000 people have been moved in the biggest evacuation of Indian history and the casualty rate has been remarkably low. With rapid deployment of the army, navy, coast guard and other reserve forces along with makeshift relief centers, thousands of lives have been saved. But disaster preparedness is as much about livelihoods as it is about lives and the cyclone's impact has been devastating with 9 million people affected and huge losses to crops and homes. Rehabilitation and restoring their livelihoods is a daunting task. Phailin should therefore be another stark reminder for us to think hard about climate adaptation in what is now a new normal in our planet's weather.The Uttarakhand floods in June, Phailin today and other disasters await India tomorrow. Ignorance and denial are not an option anymore and further inaction will come at our own peril.350.org India is organizing an online #ClimateChat on Friday, Oct. 18, 2013 at 5 p.m. IST.

It says: \"Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries.\" It explains that the reason for this is that the countries near the equator have far less variability in their weather than do the moderate-climate countries, and so the species that constitute the ecosystems there cannot tolerate temperatures outside their narrow range, which has existed within that narrow range for thousands of years. Consequently, species-extinctions will soar there much faster and earlier than here. The existing impoverished economies, within around 2,500 miles of the equator (where average per-capita incomes are less than 10% of the average in the moderate-latitude countries such as ours), will become unlivable.This study notes the \"obvious disparity between those who benefit from the process leading to climate change and those who will have to pay for most of the environmental and social costs.\" Of course, \"those who benefit from the process leading to climate change\" are the oil companies, and the coal companies, and the natural gas companies, and the pipeline and service companies, and ultimately their owners: especially the aristocratic families who control them. It would be false to assume that any poor people, even in countries such as the United States, will benefit from continuation of \"the process leading to climate change.\" However, some of the chief financial backers of the Republican Party and of other conservative political parties in the moderate-latitude countries benefit enormously from that \"process.\" Thus, many people who will not benefit from climate change end up voting for climate change; and, of course, their children and subsequent descendants will suffer greatly from their votes.A previous article I wrote reports further on this problem of greater danger for the equatorial countries. Another reports on a study in Science showing that there is already too much carbon in the atmosphere for life as we have known it to be able to continue on much longer, and that, consequently, there will be sharp increases in human conflict (crimes, wars, etc.) resulting from this carbon build-up in the atmosphere. Another reports on a study in PNAS explaining that though the near-term predictions about the effects of this atmospheric carbon build-up contain far less certainty than do the long-term predictions, there is essentially no question that two thousand years from now, life on this planet will be hellish for everyone, even if the near-term consequences of the atmosphere's existing carbon overload are far less certain. None of this is science fiction; all of it is science fact, though the Koch brothers and their friends do everything they possibly can to deceive the masses that it's not true and that the conspiracy to deceive the public is to be found amongst the 97+% of climate scientists who say that global warming is happening and that its chief cause is human atmospheric carbon emissions. Though the numbers of the Kochs suckers might be declining, it's already too late; the Kochs were successful for far too long to avert disaster now. From now on, efforts to reduce climate-change will be efforts to reduce the extent of the catastrophe, not to prevent the catastrophe.----------Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author, most recently, of They're Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records, 1910-2010, and of CHRIST'S VENTRILOQUISTS: The Event that Created Christianity."}, {"title": "Rehabilitating Rescue Dogs and Puppies", "text": "It seems I can't go anywhere without someone asking me a dog question. Should we meet, please don't hesitate. Few things give me greater pleasure than helping explain dog behavior. Once you learn to translate canine postures and responses, you'll find that your dog's actions speak louder than words.What then do specific dog behaviors tell us? In this blog, part four of my adoption series, I'll spotlight the most common frustrations people have with newly adopted rescue dogs and puppies. I don't mean to discourage dog rescue! My goal is simply to lead you into it with knowledge, empathy and solutions to common frustrations. Everyone wants a happy ending, most of all the dog or puppy.Feel free to comment on your experiences below. In the coming days I will relate some positive ways to redirect and recondition a dog's behavior without the use of intimidation, prolonged isolation or electrical stimulation. My motto? Don't dominate -- communicate.Meanwhile, here's a page from my training diary and the various rescue dogs I met this week.Monday morning, Oct. 3: Biscuits with Jesse -- dog biscuits that is.  A mix-bred spaniel mix from Nicaragua, Jesse was rescued by Joe, age 23 and sent home to his parents with love. Mom and Dad are smitten, but also overwhelmed. Jesse's clearly not accustom to motorized vehicles, interior decorations or carpeting, except as a marvelously absorbent surface to pee on.Tuesday morning, Oct. 4: Meet Rocco -- an 8-week-old husky mix from a Long Island, N.Y. shelter. Within minutes of meeting Rocco he snapped at my hand as I was gently removing a bone. Thirty minutes later and it's determined that his resource guarding is a poor fit for a dog novice household with young children. Rocco was returned to the shelter and is awaiting a home better suited to his needs.Tuesday noon, Oct. 4: Meet Rascal, a pure bred rescue who at 5 months is terrorizing the family's collies, Rosie and Petal, ages 9 years and 11 years, respectfully. The family had thought the dogs would work things out, but Rascal's exuberance is bringing out aggression never seen before in the Collies.Wednesday, Oct. 5: Dog Class Day! This fall my roster's filled with as many rescues as purebred dogs. Love knows no breed! During supervised play the rescued dogs seem to gravitate to each other. As with children, there seems to be comfort in shared experiences.Thursday 9 a.m., Oct. 5: At a rescue center in Goldens Bridge, N.Y. I meet up with the two families who've commissioned me to choose a well-tempered, child-safe puppy. Meet the candidates: 5-month-old sisters Dakota and Bridget, lively and playful pincher mixes, and four-month-old Shiloh, a sweet natured Basset Hound mix. One family can't decide, so they've chosen two, Bridget and Shiloh; the other family swoons over Dakota. The puppies are blissfully unaware that they have all landed ultimate homes equipped with kids, a loving teacher, nurturing adults and a yard to boot.Friday, Oct. 6 : A day off to spend with my favorite rescues, my furry family of four: Whoopsie, Balderdash, Hootenanny and Bamboozle!The one thing I adore about my job is that my weeks are never the same. Being a parent to a multitude of species, I feel like I walk at both ends of the leash. Blogging pulls me back to center. And it's true, I've got a soft spot for a good adoption story. These days I'm seeing more and more rescues -- you can find adorable adoptables just about everywhere. On the internet, their descriptions read like singles ads...\"Fun-loving buff Bulldog type, burly with a smooth attitude and an obsession with balls.\" City shelters seem to find their own strays, but suburban shelters are often hard-pressed to find homeless pets, and routinely transport their adoptables from \"High-Kill\" shelters in rural states.(Geoffrey Tischman Photography)Some people are naively convinced that they can save money rescuing a dog. While its true that most shelters inoculate and neuter their population, most abandoned animals are relinquished for a reason or have developed anxieties while enduring the rehoming process. Housebreaking frustration, tension chewing, manic displacement behavior that results in jumping or mouthing, are many of the complaints I hear as a trainer. More serious reactions include separation anxiety or resource guarding, which are issues that require a strong dose of empathy and patience to rehabilitate. The joys of rescuing a pet are immeasurable and memorable, but it's not a process for everyone. Think you've got what it takes to patiently work with a discarded or forgotten pet? If you do, you may just end up wondering just who rescued whom.My home is a patchwork of forgotten or discarded canines. Of my dogs, Hootenanny and Whoopsie came in as young pups, but the rest were adults when we found them. Each one -- regardless of their circumstances -- had serious issues to overcome. As a puppy Whoopsie had a urinary tract infection that prolonged the housetraining. Hootenanny came up from Arkansas with her litter and by 10-weeks-old had earned herself the nickname: \"The Cushion Shredder.\" Bamboozle's initial response to unknown sights and stimulation? A barking frenzy, reaching octaves only a little 5 pounder can hit. And Balderdash, my big burly German Shepherd Dog who was dropped at our doorstep at 18 months old? He was scared of his own shadow and frightfully anxious when left home alone.So what did I do and what can you do to prepare or help soothe your rescue's relocation anxieties? It may help to consider that many of your new pets' reactions result from confusion or stress, not a vindictive or malignant goal to upset your life. Here are five common frustrations I hear from newly adoptive parents. Can you add to the list with your own story? Please comment below.Housetraining Dogs that eliminate indoors have either not been trained to leave their the home, aka their den, to potty, or are so stressed that they're unable to regulate their internal cycle. As dogs use their urine scent as a permanent marker, many adoptables mark their new homes in order to feel more grounded in an unfamiliar setting.Chewing  Dogs chew for pleasure as well as to displace tension. Rescue dogs often chew more than stable pets, and need to be provided with satisfying outlets.Mania -- Many displaced dogs develop assertive behavior patterns , such as jumping and nipping, in an effort to get attention. And dogs, like children, do not seem to care whether the attention is negative or positive.   Separation Anxiety -- Many abandoned dogs develop a separation anxiety when paired with newly adoptive parents. Reaction to even short separation can run from mild distress, whining or chewing, to a full blown physiological reaction. These may become destructive to either themselves or their surroundings. They may exhibit other behaviors such as frenetic barking, hyper-active rituals or marking as well.Resource Guarding -- Many dogs develop resource guarding in shelters -- coveting food toys within their reach. Other dogs are abandoned because of this behavior. These dogs have not learned to \"share\" and will use aggressive displays to defend their possession or resting places.In the next few days I will examine these behaviors as well as others you share and provide tips on how to resolve them.

Had it lost, it would be stuck with one until Sierra Club, et al receive a U.S. District Court decision on the legality of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision to grant Transcanada a Nationwide Permit 12 (NWP 12) for construction of what's now called the Gulf Coast Pipeline in February 2012.Or would ecosystems suffer even greater and potentially incalculable damage from the 485-mile, 700,000 barrels per day pipeline crossing 2,227 streams?In a 2-1 decision, the Court sided with Transcanada, and by extension, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Court ruled, \"the threatened environmental injuries were outweighed by the financial harm that the injunction would cause Transcanada.\"Commenting on the case brought by Sierra Club, et al, Judge Jerome A. Holmes and Judge Paul J. Kelly, Jr. - appointees of President George W. Bush and President George H.W. Bush, respectively - shot down the arguments sharply.U.S. Appeals Court for the 10th Circuit Judge Jerome A. Holmes; Photo Credit: The White HouseHolmes and Kelly ruled that Sierra Club, et al failed to show how the pipeline will have a significant environmental impact despite the fact it's been deemed a \"fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet\" by retired NASA climate scientist James Hansen.Construction of Keystone XL's southern half - subject of significant grassroots activism by the Tar Sands Blockade and others - is now nearly complete. Tar sands dilbit is slated to begin to flow through it in early 2014.After protestors succeeded initially in delaying Keystone XL, Big Oil has chosen a \"new normal\" stealth approval method: the non-transparent NWP 12.This avoids the more strenuous National Environmental Protection Act permitting process overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which requires public hearings and public comments for major federal pipeline projects. NEPA compels the EPA to take comments into account in response throughout the Environmental Impact Statement phase, allowing robust public participation in the process.Sierra Club Staff Attorney Doug Hayes explained in an interview with DeSmogBlog that NWP 12 is for utility projects with up to a half an acre of stream or wetland impacts, and has never been used for tar sands pipelines before Keystone XL's southern half.The southern half of the pipeline was approved via Executive Order by President Barack Obama in March 2012, directly after Obama gave a speech in front of a Cushing, OK pipeyard.President Barack Obama speaks in Cushing, OK in March 2013; Photo Credit: White House\"The Corps is abusing the nationwide permit program. Nationwide permits were intended to permit categories of projects with truly minimal impacts, not tar sands oil pipelines crossing several states,\" said Hayes.Utilizing tricky legal loopholes, Transcanada used NWP 12 to push through Keystone XL's southern half in February 2012, calling each half acre segment of Keystone XL's southern half a \"single and complete project.\" The Army Corps of Engineers agreed despite the fact that Transcanada refers to the pipeline at-large as the \"Gulf Coast Pipeline project.\"\"What the Corps is doing is artificially dividing up these massive pipelines, treating them as thousands of individual projects to avoid environmental review,\" Hayes explained. \"In this case, there were 2,227 crossings of federal waterways, so the Corps has treated the Gulf Coast Pipeline as 2,227 'single and complete projects,' each of which qualifies under NWP 12.\"Sierra Club Staff Attorney Doug Hayes; Photo Credit: Sierra ClubWhy, I asked Hayes?\"The Corps artificially treats these massive pipelines as thousands of individual projects so as to qualify under NWP 12 and avoid NEPA compliance.\"NWP 12 has also been utilized by Enbridge for the Flanagan South Pipeline, a 600-mile, 600,000 barrels per day pipeline set to shuttle tar sands crude from Flanagan, IL to Cushing, OK, crossing over 2,000 streams. That pipeline is scheduled to begin operations in mid-2014, demonstrating how NWP 12 is the \"new normal\" way to fast-track domestic tar sands pipelines.Perhaps the biggest irony of the Appeals Court decision is that Judges Holmes and Kelly barely grappled with the central issue of the legal challenge to begin with: using NWP 12 rather than going through the NEPA process.\"The majority opinion avoided addressing the legal questions that are central to this lawsuit - whether the Corps violated the law in permitting this pipeline - and instead it was based on how much money a delay in construction would cost TransCanada,\" said Hayes.Though Judges Holmes and Kelly stayed mum about these issues, dissenting U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado Judge William Mart\u00ednez - an Obama appointee - did not, pulling no punches in doing so.U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado Judge William Mart\u00ednez; Photo Credit: Judgepedia\"Given the totality of the circumstances...I believe the...Gulf Coast Pipeline required a comprehensive NEPA analysis,\" Mart\u00ednez wrote.\"There are also no specific findings in support of the Corps' conclusion that the Gulf Coast Pipeline, as a whole, would have minimal cumulative impact. The failure to consider the cumulative effects of all of the water crossings involved in the Gulf Coast Pipeline violates the terms of NWP 12, and, therefore, the approval of the use of NWP 12 for construction of the Gulf Coast Pipeline violated the law.\"Though Judges Holmes and Kelly grappled with the issue of water crossings - belittling the amount of water Keystone XL's southern half would cross over - Mart\u00ednez said it's about much more than just water.There is \"real and signifcant harm caused by the actual construction of the pipeline, including the clearing of trees and vegetation, removing topsoil, filling wetlands, building access roads, and clearing an eighty-five foot construction right-of-way for the length of the pipeline,\" he stated.Hayes agreed with this assessment, pointing to examples of things the Judges simply ignored in their assessment.\"[T]he court's balancing test ignored the host of environmental impacts associated with this pipeline, including the risks of tar sands oil spills,\" said Hayes.\"Remember that the 2010 tar sands pipeline spill in Michigan is still being cleaned up, and so far has cost over a billion dollars. It's a bit of a Catch-22 to say that this is all just about a few acres of wetlands loss, when the whole point of this lawsuit is that the Corps avoided analyzing any of the pipeline's environmental impacts as required by NEPA.\"Lastly, Mart\u00ednez put the onus on Transcanada for its economic decision-making.\"Transcanada chose to incur its economic harm by entering into contracts for services before the Gulf Coast Pipeline was approved, even in light of the controversial nature of the Pipeline,\" said Mart\u00ednez (emphasis his).Sierra Club, et al now await a summary judgment from the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on whether Keystone XL failed the dictates of NEPA. It's a key decision, Hayes says, because \"a ruling in our favor could prevent the Corps from doing this in the future.\"While they await this lower court judgment, activists continue efforts to fend off these pipeline projects.\"This decision yet again demonstrates why direct action is necessary. The permitting process for Keystone XL's southern leg was illegal, yet regulators, inspectors, Obama, and the courts are failing to do what is necessary to protect the people and ecosystems threatened by this toxic pipeline,\" said Ron Seifert, a Tar Sands Blockade spokesman.\"If all the branches of government are so helplessly captured by industry that they will do nothing to stave off climate change, then the people must rise up and take the defense of the environment into their own hands.\""}, {"title": "'Big Coal' Favored Over Electric Power Competition in Arizona?", "text": "Arizona's storied battle over net metering is expected to come to a head in mid-October, when the five-member Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) decides to vote on it, or send it before an administrative law judge. But before Arizona's net metering issue ever surfaced, the state utility commission had decided to explore opening the state's electric markets to competition -- something Arizona briefly tried before.ACC planned to hold public hearings to gauge how electric deregulation might impact the state, opening a docket for written public comments. And those comments came pouring.\"Stakeholders have said that 'we don't want you to delay the vote,'\" Jodi Jerich, ACC Executive Director told me in early September.But seemingly out of nowhere, the commission voted 4-1 during a routine meeting on Sept. 11 to quietly shelve the deregulation proposal. While there were plenty of good reasons to reject electric deregulation outright (high retail electric prices; no other Rocky Mountain deregulated state as a model; the possibility of electric market manipulation like California's Enron scandal and now with J. P. Morgan), the ACC simply cited qualms about its \"constitutionality.\"Yet, one of the biggest concerns expressed in written comments asking ACC to \"immediately end its inquiry\" into deregulation was the impact it would have on the region's coal-fired power plants and coal mines.\"It's been very interesting to see how groups have responded on the coal plant issues, and it certainly does highlight the risks of these big old coal plants and the risks of investing more dollars in them,\" said Sandy Bahr, Director of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter.Arizonans for Electric Choice & Competition, Direct Energy, Noble Americas Energy Solutions, Constellation New Energy, the conservative Goldwater Institute, Americans for Prosperity -- Arizona, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., and the Arizona Mining Association had all urged the ACC to move forward with deregulation.Interestingly, most solar energy groups became strange bedfellows, since they were not opposed to deregulation.\"We operate currently both in regulated and deregulated markets. It doesn't make a big difference,\" said Edward Fenster, Co-CEO of SunRun in a phone interview. \"We've probably seen less opposition in deregulated markets honestly because utilities are used to competition.\"In comments filed with ACC, the Alliance for Solar Choice noted deregulation and solar net metering \"are compatible.\" Vote Solar, NRG Solar, SunEdison, Solar Alliance, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) agreed.\"There are a number of states that have a deregulated electric market that also have thriving renewable energy standards, such as New York and New Jersey,\" said Rhone Resch, SEIA President and CEO in an email response.Opposing deregulation were the Arizona Power Consumers Coalition, and the state's largest utilities: Arizona Public Service, Tucson Electric Power, and Salt River Project.\"What you see over and over in the states that deregulated, the large energy users peel off, they go make their own deal,\" explained Nancy LaPlaca, an energy consultant who served as policy adviser to former Arizona Corporation Commissioner Paul Newman from 2009-2012. \"What scares the bejesus out of the utilities is they know if they are forced to have deregulation, then they get stuck with all the residential people and that's where you make less profit.\"But most telling was how the coal interests rallied behind opposition from the Navajo Nation, which covers parts of northern Arizona and New Mexico. Tribal leaders feared new electric competition would force the closing of both the coal-fired Four Corners and Navajo Generating Stations, as well as the two coal mines that supply them -- all located on their reservation and all supplying land lease revenue and jobs.In written comments to the ACC, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly said closure of the two power plants \"would be catastrophic for the Navajo Nation.\"The state's largest utility -- Arizona Public Service -- had cited deregulation uncertainty for delaying their long-planned buy-out of the Four Corners Power Plant outside Farmington, N.M. If that plan fell through, the power plant would probably close.That would be bad news for the Navajo Nation, who had just formed the Navajo Transitional Energy Company (NTEC) in April in order to buy the Navajo Coal Mine in New Mexico from Australia's BHP Billiton, which supplies 8 million tons of coal a year to Four Corners. The tribe planned to continue selling coal to the plant, but APS made plain that it would not sign a coal purchase agreement until Arizona's deregulation issue was settled.The Navajo Nation has a similar interest in the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz. Closing that power plant would affect nearby Peabody Energy's Kayenta Coal Mine since the power plant is the mine's only customer and tribal leaders had just agreed on a land lease extension through 2044 with the power plant's operator, Salt River Project. The new lease would raise annual tribal revenues from the 1969 price of $3 million a year to $44 million a year when it takes effect in 2019 -- the same year the land lease with Peabody's coal mine is up for renewal.But Salt River later wrote the ACC on Aug. 16 that \"NGS will require significant investment to keep the plant operating,\" warning that \"a deregulated electric market will not support this type of investment.\"The odd logic for keeping the coal plants and mines open is it gives the Navajo -- and the southwest -- an avenue for \"transitioning\" into \"more renewable and alternative sources\" of energy. That's because the Navajo's energy company, NTEC, is mandated \"to reinvest 10 percent of its net income in clean and renewable energy resources.\" According to the NTEC, \"coal gasification\" is considered \"clean and renewable energy resources.\" In fact, the \"coal as a transition energy\" argument got further muddled in other documents filed with the ACC.\"If NGS and FCPP shut down, Arizona will forever lose coal as a reliable, affordable source of energy,\" wrote Navajo President Shelly, noting deregulation's impact \"will further compromise\" the Navajo's \"market for coal extraction and power generation.\"The Central Arizona Project (CAP) sided with the Navajo. CAP, the largest and most costly aqueduct in the U.S., supplies over 80 percent of Arizona through a 336-mile canal running from the Colorado River into southern Arizona. In order to pump that water, 90 percent of CAP's electricity comes from the Navajo Generating Station. Shut NGS down, and water rates would \"skyrocket with potentially devastating consequences for Arizona's economy,\" warned CAP in their Aug. 22 comments to ACC.Tucson Electric Power, which gets some power from both coal plants, took a different approach by pointing to the -- then impending -- proposed EPA carbon pollution rules. TEP wrote in their July 15 comments that with \"a White House committed to combating climate change,\" the EPA is \"drafting new restrictions... that threaten the future of coal-fired power plants.\" TEP argued that electric competition \"could push the risks of coal-plant ownership beyond the breaking point.\"At that time, EPA had not yet made its Sept. 20 announcement regarding emission rules for new power plants, and the proposed rules on existing power plants are not due until June 2014. Interestingly, the day before that big EPA unveiling, the Energy Department had quietly announced it was reviving a program to pump some $8 billion into helping the fossil fuel industry produce cleaner energy -- including new coal plant emissions technology.The Sept. 11 decision by Arizona's utility commission to simply shelve deregulation must have been painful for the all-Republican, quasi-judicial elected commissioners, since four of the five commissioners are alumni of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). But while deregulation fits nicely into the conservative ideology, beating-back Obama's \"War on Coal\" is even higher on the conservative agenda.So, the \"Coal-izona\" economy is safe and moving ahead for now: APS is finalizing their take-over of the Four Corners power plant and Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly restated his support for buying the Navajo Mine during a press conference on Oct. 4.Ironically, an Environment America Center report outlining \"America's 100 Dirtiest Power Plants\" released Sept. 10 -- the day before the ACC voted to shelve deregulation and save coal -- ranked the Navajo Generating Station at No. 10, while Four Corners was close behind as the 15th dirtiest."}, {"title": "Solutions to the Climate Crisis: Hidden in Plain Sight", "text": "The media can be part of the solution to the climate crisis by reporting on the science and the emerging answers.The most censored story of our lifetime is hiding in plain sight. We humans are disrupting the climate of the planet to the point where the world our children and grandchildren will inhabit may be unrecognizable.The risk we are taking is not something discussed in polite company, much less in the corporate press. Instead of covering the many facets of this impending crisis and the options for mobilizing a response, the corporate press has largely served up a diet of distortion and distraction. Even the progressive media has a mixed record on covering the climate crisis.Yet stories that explore the depth of -- and solutions to -- the climate crisis are essential to any prospect that we will respond at the scale needed.The Failure to Report on a Crisis After years of record-breaking fires, droughts, heat waves, and storms, public opinion is beginning to move toward greater comprehension, although at a rate that is still dangerously slow. While 97 percent of peer-reviewed scientific studies conclude that the Earth is warming because of human influences, just 42 percent of the general public in the United States believes the world is warming because of human activity.And though journalists cover the stories of particular wildfires, droughts, megastorms, floods, and other events exacerbated by the shifting climate, until recently the corporate media have neglected to explore something that scientists are warning about and that many people perceive with their own senses: that these are not isolated incidents, but signs of a long-term and accelerating disruption in climate stability.The hard truth is that scientists predict a temperature rise of six degrees Celsius by the end of the century unless we take action. This level of heating will hobble agriculture, deplete water supplies, and move shorelines. It will make many areas uninhabitable and cause famine, widespread extinctions, and massive movements of climate refugees. And it will be largely irreversible for centuries thereafter.Corporate Power and Censorship  Why have we been unable to take action in the face of a threat larger and more long-lasting than terrorism? The climate crisis highlights a systemic flaw in human society today: the power of large corporations over our economy, governance, and way of life overwhelms other forces.Corporations dealing in fossil fuel are among the biggest and most powerful on the planet. Together with other large corporations, as well as the think tanks and lobbyists they fund, they have undermined efforts to reach international agreements on climate change, and to get government action on renewable energy and energy efficiency, smart transportation options, and other policies that could counter the threat of climate disruption. With a focus on making the most money possible for shareholders and executives, the fate of human and other life on the planet just doesn't show up on the quarterly balance sheet. With billions of dollars in profits and a Supreme Court friendly to the power of big corporations, corporate influence on government goes largely unchecked.An economy that concentrates more wealth and power each year, while undermining our world's capacity to support life, goes unquestioned when the media is owned by big corporations that rely on corporate advertising.We also have a cultural flaw. Influenced by billions of dollars of advertising, popular culture has come to equate having lots of stuff with success and happiness. Those at the top can accumulate with abandon and without considering the implications for the future. Meanwhile, people in the 99 percent increasingly struggle just to get by. Other values that are just as much a part of the founding culture of the United States -- frugality, community, neighbor-helping-neighbor, contribution to the whole -- have been pushed aside by the advertising-driven impulse to buy. The production and eventual disposal of all that stuff exacts a price on the finite resources and energy capacities of the planet, and the bill is coming due.Climate coverage: the bad and the ugly Facing the dire reality of a destabilized climate is not easy, and some of the country's most influential media don't even try. The Wall Street Journal's notoriously right-wing opinion section published a column on May 9, 2013, titled \"In Defense of Carbon Dioxide.\" The piece celebrates rising levels of carbon dioxide as a boon to plant life. Columbia Journalism Review columnist Ryan Chittum, who is a former Wall Street Journal writer himself, called it \"shameful even by the dismal standards of that page.\"According to a January 2013 Media Matters report, not a single climate scientist appeared as a guest on the influential Sunday morning television talk shows during the previous four years, nor were any climate scientists quoted. Most of those invited to speak on global warming were either media figures or politicians, but, among the politicians, not a single one was a Democrat. Climate change deniers on the shows went unchallenged.The nightly news shows had somewhat more coverage, and most of that was driven by extreme weather events, according to the report. But this coverage, too, was biased: 60 percent of the politicians on the air were Republicans.Most journalists want to be perceived as objective, and so for years much of the climate reporting included an ersatz balance: climate deniers were given equal time even though they were a tiny fraction of the scientific community; the fact that many were funded by the fossil fuel lobby was rarely mentioned. The New York Times is among those that now explicitly reject this he-said-she-said approach.The result of this distorted coverage is that precious years, during which a well-informed people might have acted, have been lost to confusion produced by so-called \"objective\" journalism.There's an additional, less recognized flaw with journalism as currently practiced. Journalists are considered objective when their reporting accepts the dominant worldview as a given, without questioning beliefs and assumptions that may or may not hold up to scrutiny. The good journalist, in other words, goes along with the worldview of the powerful. Today, that worldview includes the assumption that all growth is good and can go on indefinitely, that a rising tide will lift all boats (an ironic phrase in this time of sea-level rise), that technology and free enterprise will solve any problem, and that the Earth will provide all we need.Real objective journalism would question these assumptions, especially those contradicted by the evidence on the ground -- and in the glaciers.Climate Coverage: Who's Doing It Well? Although some of the media has flouted their responsibility to truth-telling, others have been extraordinary. Rolling Stone published a game-changing piece by Bill McKibben on the math of climate change, which shows that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground if we are to avert climate catastrophe. And among Project Censored's Top 25 stories is Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed's article from The Guardian on the likelihood of food shortages becoming the new normal, in large part because of the impact of climate change on crop yields. The Guardian's coverage of the climate crisis has been among the best and most consistent among the large newspapers. (Full disclosure: I occasionally write a column for the Guardian). And there are some extraordinary blogs like InsideClimateNews, Grist, Climate Progress, ClimateWire, and Real Climate, which are out in front on climate coverage.Project Censored has highlighted some of the key climate stories of the last decade. Among the project's annual list of the censored stories over the past years are independent journalists' reports on the disruption to marine species resulting from global warming, the role of excessive consumption in the climate crisis, and the flaws in World Bank cap-and-trade schemes, which result in the displacement of indigenous farmers.Still, there is a mixed record among the progressive press on climate coverage. Perhaps this is a reflection of a split within the progressive world, which until recently was divided between those who focus on the environment and those who focus on politics and social justice. Much of the progressive press has left climate change to environmental magazines.The implicit view that environmental issues are for backpackers, conservationists, and middle-class white folks is outdated and dangerous. The climate crisis is changing everyone's life -- especially the poor and vulnerable.Making Solutions Visible More truly objective reporting on the climate crisis and its systemic causes would be a huge improvement over what we find now. But still it would be just half the story. The other half is the solutions. We need much more reporting on solutions, and not just to keep despair from sending us screaming into those rising seas.We need solutions journalism because it is the only way we can develop the global consensus we need to take action and the knowledge base that makes that action effective.Over just a few hundred years, we clever humans have transformed our world, creating a vast fossil fuel-driven industrial economy that permits high-consumption lifestyles (for some). Until recently, we lacked an understanding of what industrialization was doing to the prospects for our children and their children.But we have the smarts to create a world in which the climate is stable, diverse species thrive, and all people have a shot at a good life. The means to do that are as diverse as the factors that cause the problem. Renewable energy can displace carbon-based fuels. Buildings can be built or retrofitted for super-efficiency. Organic fertilizers can build the fertility and resilience of the soil while safely storing carbon, replacing the chemical fertilizers that are a major contributor to the climate crisis. Fuel-efficient vehicles, fast trains, and bicycles can replace gas guzzlers. A greater appreciation of time well-spent with family and friends, and of the satisfaction of meaningful work, can replace an obsession with owning and using up stuff.Each of these shifts improves our chances of stabilizing the climate, and most of them have multiple benefits: they improve health, clean up air and water, improve community life, create new economic opportunities, and promote equity. And some do all of these at once.But the potential of these solutions can't be fulfilled unless people find out about them. That's why the media is so important.With international talks at a standstill and little national leadership on this issue, the focus of action has shifted, becoming much more bottom-up. Local and state governments (and an exceptional few national governments) around the world are instituting policies, like carbon taxes, that help shift the market toward cleaner energy sources. Policy makers are rethinking the use of economic growth and the gross domestic product as a measure of progress. Inventors and entrepreneurs are coming up with new ways to produce clean energy or to cut the inefficient use of energy.The Solutions at the Grassroots Importantly, there is a climate justice movement happening that few know exists -- a movement founded in the grassroots and especially in communities that are often ignored by the corporate media: Appalachia, indigenous communities, youth, farmers, fishermen, and small businesses. It's a movement that doesn't separate environmental concerns from human concerns, but that recognizes that they are one and the same.At the forefront of this movement are young people, ranchers, tribal leaders, people living near refineries, those resisting hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking), and others who are most affected by the fossil fuel industry. People are using their bodies to block the building of tar sands pipelines, to stop mountaintop removal, to prevent drilling in their communities--both to protect their land, water, and health, and to protect the climate.The 350.org campaign, headed up by Bill McKibben, is spurring actions around the world, including civil disobedience in front of the White House aimed at convincing President Barack Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline.Others are responding to the climate crisis through changes in their own lives. Many are finding much greater satisfaction in ways of life focused on community or personal development. Young people are seeking out livelihoods that allow them to contribute to a more sustainable planet and to ride out the storms they see on the horizon. There's extraordinary interest in developing local food systems. These deeper cultural shifts offer another part of the solutions matrix.These new policy initiatives, innovations, social movements, and lifestyle shifts are rarely covered, but with all that's at stake, these responses deserve to be front-page news. We need this sort of reporting to seek out the many solutions, investigate which ones are working, and tell the stories through the media now available. Out of those many stories and many solutions, the answers can emerge. If these answers spread, are replicated, and inspire others, we have a shot at preserving a healthy planet and our own future.What Solutions Journalism Makes Possible The truth is that there is no shortage of solutions -- whether it's Germany's turn to solar power or the carbon-storing power of restored soils. But given the shortage of stories about solutions, it's little wonder that so many people -- once they understand the implications of the climate crisis -- leap right from denial to despair. When stories of people taking action are censored, when the innovations that could help us tackle the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced go unreported, when the ordinary people and grassroots leaders working to build a sustainable future go unquoted, people are left isolated and feeling powerless.That's what makes solutions journalism so important at this point in human history.When the myriad efforts to build a sustainable world are covered, the rapid evolution of our society toward solutions becomes possible. The best innovations can travel quickly and build on one another -- bike lanes in one city become a linked system of bike lanes and public transit in another. A public food forest, where all are free to harvest fresh fruits and nuts, sparks the same idea in another community. One city sets out to be carbon neutral, to reduce asthma and heart disease, and inspires other cities to follow suit. If they encounter these sorts of stories, people don't feel alone, powerless, or foolish when they pick up a shovel and plant a tree, start an urban garden, or risk arrest blockading a tar sands pipeline. They see their work as part of a much larger fabric of change -- one with real possibility for a better world.So here's where solutions journalism is at its best. Just as an individual coal plant is not the whole picture in terms of the climate crisis, the individual windmill is not the whole solution. To meet its potential, solutions journalism must investigate not only the individual innovations, but also the larger pattern of change -- the emerging ethics, institutions, and ways of life that are coming into existence.The change will not happen from the top down -- most of the leaders of big government, big business, and even big religion are too entrenched in the status quo to offer much help on this score.Instead, it is the actions of millions of ordinary people that have the best chance of transforming our society to one that can live within its ecological means and meet the needs of humans and other life forms. To do that, we need evidence-based stories of practical, feasible innovations. But we also need to see the larger picture that they are a part of, the new ways of doing business that are rooted in community and work in harmony with our ecosystems, along with the emerging values and ways of life that create genuine well-being without compromising the life-sustaining capacity of the planet. We need to experience the democratic impulse, which, at times, can overcome the top-down power of giant corporations.* * *Journalists, it has been said, write the first draft of history. In that spirit, discerning these patterns of change -- which ones have promise, which ones are taking hold -- is an inexact science. But a bottom-up global process thrives when the first draft is available, and all of those with a stake in the future can see that they, themselves, are its authors.Sarah van Gelder wrote this article as the forward to the book Project Censored 2014: Fearless Speech in Fateful Times.

The determination of these findings by the court will define exactly how much the oil giant owes in Clean Water Act fines, which can range from $1,100 to $4,300 per barrel.Attorneys for BP say their scientists estimate 2.45 million barrels spilled out of their broken well-head, while the DOJ, relying on a combination of four experts, estimates 4.2 million barrels of crude spewed into the warm Gulf waters during and after the deadly blowout. That's a whopping discrepancy of roughly 1.7 million barrels, or as much as $7.31 billion.As O'Rourke alluded, BP does not exactly have a reputation for coming clean on the facts surrounding the disaster. Early on, the oil giant told the public that the leak was an estimated 5,000 barrels per day, yet according the company's own internal emails BP knew that up to 100,000 barrels per day were flowing unchecked into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.Photo credit: Linda Hooper BuiBP has consistently used their \"science\" to low-ball the amount of the spill and minimize its impacts on Gulf Coast residents and ecosystems.Additionally, contracted clean-up workers who continue to struggle daily with serious health concerns brought on by their exposure to BP's toxic crude and the oil dispersant Corexit, have often hit a wall of BP's \"independent\" data.For more than three years they, along with many coastal residents sickened by the disaster, have desperately sought the independent, unbiased science that could answer their questions regarding what they were exposed to and to provide for effective treatment. In response to their pleas, BP contracted highly paid public relations firms touting industry-friendly scientists to cloud the truth.In September of 2011, ChemRisk, the for-profit scientific consulting firm now part of Cardno Chemrisk, released an \"independent\" study concluding that off-shore workers who cleaned up BP's oil between April and October 2010 were not exposed to harmful levels of certain airborne chemical compounds. These volatile organic compounds, which included cancer causing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or xylene, are collectively referred to as BTEX.The study, published in the July 28, 2011 issue of Environmental Science and Technology, was announced on September 2 with a carefully worded press release misleadingly titled, Study by Leading Scientific Consulting Firm Finds No Evidence of Health Dangers for Gulf Coast Cleanup Workers.Yet, according to Dr. Wilma Subra, a prominent gulf coast chemist and 1999 MacArthur \"Genius Award\" Fellow, ChemRisk's analysis of exposure levels is most notable for what it does not include.\"They took a very narrow look at the data,\" she explains. \"If they had broadened their look, it's very likely they would have found that semi-volatiles were present in the air.\"Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), which were not analyzed in this study, are very different from BTEX chemicals, as they include polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and a host of other chemicals that are also present in crude oil.Subra suspects SVOCs and PAHs are responsible for many of the significant health effects experienced by gulf coast residents and clean-up workers.Equally concerning in this study is the murky use of the term \"independent.\" Although previously published media reports clearly state that ChemRisk was not paid by BP, the samples for the study were collected and provided by BP, leaving Subra to question just how \"independent\" the findings can be.\"This is a typical thing they put out on behalf of industry,\" she states.As it turns out, ChemRisk has a long, and on at least one occasion fraudulent, history of defending big polluters, using questionable ethics to help their clients avoid legal responsibility for their actions.One well-known example is the case that became the basis for the movie Erin Brockovich, where the polluter and defendant Pacific Gas and Electric (PG & E) was found to have paid ChemRisk to discredit research done by Chinese scientist Dr. Jian Dong Zhang.In an earlier study, Zhang had found strong links between chromium-6, which was found in Hinkley, California's drinking water, and cancer. ChemRisk obtained Dr. Zhang's data, and without his knowledge, intentionally manipulated the findings to contradict his own earlier studies.The erroneous data was then submitted to the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (JOEM) as though it had been re-worked by Dr. Zhang personally.Led to believe it was legitimate, the JOEM initially published the findings, but was later forced to issue a retraction, because at the time of submission no disclosure was made regarding ChemRisk's contribution of intellectual work and finances to the study, (click here for more information on what is now known about the very harmful effects of chromium-6.)While conducting research for this article, we contacted ChemRisk for an interview with one of the authors of the study on clean-up workers' health after the BP disaster. The interview was allowed to proceed only in the presence of another individual who was presented as an additional Chemrisk scientist.The individual, who identified himself as \"Dick Keil, with Chemrisk,\" steered the conversation, including the introducing of the Chemrisk scientist, followed by a refusal to allow the discussion to be recorded.During the interview, it became clear that Keil was keeping a tight reign on both our line of interview questions, as well as the scientist's responses.Problem: Dick Keil is not a scientist.As our research has uncovered, Dick (Richard) Keil is a former Bloomberg writer who was a member of the traveling White House press pool during George W. Bush's presidency. He has also worked with the office of Former US Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Paul Brinkley, who until last year headed the US Defense Department's Task Force for Business Stability Operations in Afghanistan.Additionally, and at the time of the interview, Keil was employed by Purple Strategies, a Washington DC based public relations firm hired by BP in June of 2010Keil, an experienced and extraordinarily well-connected media veteran, was paid by Purple Strategies on behalf of BP to ensure that the only information reported to the public was that which would minimize BP's financial responsibility.Further research linked Purple Strategies to the distribution of the press release announcing the results of the \"independent\" study.A ChemRisk representative has denied that Purple Strategies has ever worked for ChemRisk itself, a call to Purple Strategies was not returned, and BP has refused to comment on this information.Although Dick Keil has since moved on to a position as Senior Media Relations Advisor with Exxon Mobil in Dallas, \"science\" and \"truth-for-hire\" public relations firms have continued to work non-stop to maneuver BP into the best possible light and legal position in order to protect it's bottom line.Meanwhile, and while the BP trial continues in New Orleans, Gulf Coast residents are left wondering if BP will ever be held responsible for the damage done to their fisheries, ecosystems and livelihoods, wait to see if their bodies will ever recover from an assault of BP's oil and dispersants, and wonder if anyone will ever - in the words of Purple Strategies' spin writers, found in the mouth of former BP President Tony Hayward - \"make it right.\"Karen Savage contributed to this article."}, {"title": "PHOTOS: The Oil Spill North Dakota Tried to Keep Secret", "text": "On September 29th, Steve Jensen, a farmer in northwest North Dakota, discovered crude oil \"spewing and bubbling 6 inches high\" out on his field while he was harvesting wheat. The spewing oil came from a break in Tesoro Corporation's underground pipeline which carries crude oil from Bakken shale formation (fracking for oil) to Columbus, North Dakota. By the time clean up crews made it out to Jensen's field, over 20,000 barrels of oil had spilled, making this one of the largest spills in state history.It took nearly two weeks after Jensen first reported the spill for the state to finally make the news public, and as you can see from the exclusive Greenpeace photos below, the damage is extensive.North Dakota and Bakken have become coveted areas for oil executives bent on getting the most extreme and remote fossil fuels out of the ground now that the \"easy\" reserves are on the decline. As we saw in Mayflower, Arkansas earlier this year, pipelines spill, and so as long as we let oil companies keep us locked into these forms of extreme fossil fuels, we'll continue to see spills like these."}, {"title": "Russia Denies Bail For American Greenpeace Captain Peter Willcox And Activist Camila Speziale", "text": "By Alissa de CarbonnelMOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Russia denied bail on Monday to the American captain of a Greenpeace ship and another activist who are among 30 environmentalists arrested on charges of piracy over a protest at an Arctic drilling platform.Captain Peter Willcox and Greenpeace activist Camila Speziale, 21, who has Italian and Argentinian citizenship, had appealed against an order that they be held in pre-trial detention through late November.Decisions on Arctic Sunrise crew members Cristian D'Alessandro of Italy and David John Haussmann of New Zealand were expected later on Monday.A court in the northern port city of Murmansk has already denied bail to two Britons and four Russians held for the Sept. 18 protest in which activists tried to scale the Prirazlomnaya oil rig and security forces later boarded the Greenpeace ship.The piracy charges, punishable by up to 15 years' jail, appear aimed at sending a message that Moscow will not tolerate attempts to disrupt its development of the resource-rich Arctic.Other countries and firms seeking to exploit Arctic energy resources face similar concerns from environmentalists, who fear they will destroy a pristine eco-system.Willcox, 60, a veteran campaigner who was at the helm of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior when it was bombed and sunk by the French secret service in 1985, denied the charges against him in court.\"I have been doing this for 40 years and never faced a charge like this,\" the state-run Russian news agency RIA quoted him as saying. \"If I could start everything over, I would stay in New York.\"Greenpeace says the protest at the rig owned by state-controlled Russian energy company Gazprom was peaceful and calls the piracy charges absurd and unfounded.\"He is a hero not a pirate,\" Willcox's wife, Maggie, said in a statement. \"I appeal to the common sense and conscience of the Russian authorities to let my husband and the rest of the people from the Arctic Sunrise come home.\"President Vladimir Putin has said the activists were not pirates but that they had violated international law. The head of the Kremlin's human rights advisory body has said he would ask prosecutors to withdraw the piracy charges.Investigators have said more charges will be pressed against some protesters after drugs and other suspect items were found on the ship. Greenpeace denies there were illegal items aboard.Those arrested include citizens of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine. (Editing by Mark Heinrich)"}, {"title": "We Need to Accelerate the Development of Sustainability Metrics", "text": "If we are to make the transition to a renewable resource based economy, we need to do a better job of measuring the sustainability of our organizations, cities and nations. In an excellent article published in 2002 entitled \"Using Sustainability Metrics to Guide Decision Making,\" Jeanette Schwarz, Beth Beloff and Earl Beaver proposed a framework for developing measures of sustainability within organizations. In that piece, the authors identified what they called the \"five basic indicators of sustainability\":Their very accessible article provides details that define and further explain these measures. Since that time a wide variety of organizations have begun to develop and implement an even wider variety of sustainability measures. The retailing giant Walmart requires its vendors to measure and report their performance on sustainability indicators before Walmart will purchase their products. Many companies are measuring and reporting their sustainability performance in annual reports to their shareholders. These are all important steps in bringing sustainability into routine management decision-making. As Peter Drucker once famously observed, \"if you can't measure it you can't manage it.\" Without measurement, you can't tell if your management actions are making the situation better or worse.While the development of these organizational level indicators is critical and must be continued, it is time to begin the process of settling on organizational sustainability indicators that everyone can use. We need a generally accepted set of definitions and indicators for measuring sustainability. We also need independent auditors to verify that these numbers are real. Numbers without verification are ultimately useless.Just as we have generally accepted accounting practices and clear definitions of financial indicators, we need to extend that process into these more tangible and physical measures of organizational performance: sustainability metrics. These measures should ultimately be part of overall private sector organizational performance measures, as important as market share, return on equity and profit and loss. In the public and nonprofit sectors, the organization's overall performance measures would be different, but of equal importance: Sustainability metrics would be reported along with data on crime reduction, graduation rates, medical treatment outcomes, emergency response time and other indicators of public sector performance. They should also be added to or included within normal organizational process and output measures such as labor productivity/efficiency, value of goods and services delivered, employment, labor turnover and so on. Ultimately these physical dimensions of sustainability must be defined as a key, but routinized element, of organizational management. In the near future, any organization that is not run to maximize sustainability performance would be considered a poorly managed organization, comparable to a private firm that could not turn a profit or a police department with a rising crime rate. Before long, all effective managers will need to be sustainability managers.In order to contribute to the process of sustainability metric development, I recently initiated a new research program on Sustainability Policy and Management at Columbia University's Earth Institute. This research program has initiated a long-term project on sustainability metrics. Our metrics research recently began with an effort to take inventory. We have started to develop a database on all the sustainability metrics we can find. We will attempt to describe these indicators and understand them. Next we hope to analyze the indicators for commonalities in order to identify the world's most utilized sustainability indicators. This analysis would then form the basis for a conversation about generally accepted sustainability metrics.Another part of this discussion will focus on the development of local, state and national sustainability indicators. One example of a national sustainability metric was the Labor Department's effort to measure and report on green jobs. This very important project was suspended last spring due to the budget sequestration in a very short-sighted and even petulant decision by the Obama Administration to respond to the budget cuts. This effort should be restored immediately, and other aggregate measures of sustainability at the macro level need to be developed and implemented.Measurement may sound like an arcane, technical and unimportant subject, but it is actually critical to action. Its importance to management decision making in a data driven environment cannot be understated. Anything pursued in a serious way in a modern organization is measured. The absence of measurement encourages the most talented people in the organization to gravitate away from unmeasured and therefore unimportant activity.A sign of the growing importance of sustainability management is the impressive number of efforts to develop and utilize sustainability metrics. Some of this is related to the huge influence of Walmart on its supply chain. By definition, Walmart is in the business of retailing the consumer items having the broadest appeal in the American (and increasingly global) marketplace. By requiring sustainability metrics from their suppliers, those producing goods sold by Walmart must require their suppliers to provide metrics as well. This is having a massive impact on the movement to incorporate sustainability into routine organizational management. However, it is not clear that the measures under development are appropriate, reliable or valid. Moreover, the collection and reporting of these metrics is voluntary, self-completed, inadequately audited and there is no penalty for deceptive, incomplete or incompetent reporting.  The effort to develop an effective system of sustainability metrics is still in its infancy. Academics, business leaders and government officials must work together to develop and refine acceptable indicators. A standardized system of data collection, verification and audit needs to be put into place. In addition to organizational level indicators, we need to do some hard thinking about developing some multiple indicator scales that might chart local, state and national progress toward a sustainable economy. An easy-to-understand measure like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the unemployment rate would help guide public policies encouraging sustainability management. One possible approach would be to do a better job of including environmental benefits and costs in the GDP measure itself. A revival of the Labor Department's effort to track green jobs should also be a high priority.While the American national government seems too busy self-destructing to take on a new and constructive task, it would be quite helpful if a national effort were undertaken to develop and build consensus around a set of sustainability metrics. One of the problems of the current drive to develop sustainability metrics is the absence of an authoritative and potentially objective moderator of the discussion. Corporations and environmental interest groups are key stakeholders in any metrics discussion, but they each have their own axe to grind and cannot be allowed to have the final word. Government has a key role to play.The good news is that we are ready to have these discussions and develop a way to measure organizational sustainability efforts along with our nation's progress in making the transition to a sustainable economy. It will take a number of years to complete this work, but the sooner we get started the sooner we will be able to make the transition to a renewable resource based, sustainable economy."}, {"title": "Who Wants a Shutdown?", "text": "More than 840,000 Americans have been sent home instead of work. National parks and public lands are off-limits to everyone but oil and gas drillers. Nine out of 10 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been furloughed. Small business loans are on hold, health and safety inspections are suspended, and our economy is taking a $160 million hit every day -- you'd think that we'd be hearing universal condemnation of the ongoing government shutdown.But some special interests are beneftting from public health and consumer watchdogs being pulled off the beat -- and they don't even have the sense to be quiet.Take Southern Company CEO Thomas Fanning, for example. While speaking to senators at a meeting the day after the government shut down, SNL Energy reported that Fanning couldn't contain his enthusiasm:\"I was thrilled actually to have this event in this kind of environment.\"With clean air cops at the EPA off the beat during the shutdown, big polluters like Fanning may have it easy -- there are fewer people watching what his company is dumping into our air and water. For the rest of us, its not so thrilling.But Fanning's not alone. Indeed, Michael Needham - chief executive of the right-wing Heritage Action political organization-- sang the shutdown's praises. Amid news that Heritage Action took $500,000 from the oil-rich Koch Brothers, Needham lauded the shuttering of two government agencies that have been the target of both Heritage and Koch smear campaigns, declaring he'd love to see them closed until the extremely unlikely defunding of the Affordable Care Act -- in other words, indefinitely:\"If we want to sit in a government shutdown for the next several weeks over the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] being shut down, I'm perfectly happy to sit in that situation until President Obama stops this unaffordable and unfair law.\"Its not just a clear example of the destructive goals of big polluters and their political allies - its more proof that the big money groups targeting the EPA's clean air, water and climate protections are the same ones attacking the NLRB's laws protecting American workers. And they aren't just trying to contaminate our planet and our workplaces - they are trying to contaminate our democracy.Fanning and Southern Company dumped more than $17 million worth of campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures into our system in 2012. And using mouthpieces like Heritage Action, the Kochs spent upwards of $400 million trying to push their reckless agenda. And, in recent weeks, Heritage has used some of their largesse to emerge as one of the major forces behind the shutdown.Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said it best: \"We didn't reach this nadir in our democracy by accident. It's the result of a systematic attack on the basic democratic principles of justice and equality by a handful of people who have no interest in a healthy, functioning democracy.\"The reality is as more money has poured into our system, we've seen many of our elected officials turn from addressing solutions to creating crises, like this shutdown. At the same time, we've seen more attacks on our air and water, on our workers, and on our democracy. It's critical that those of us who want to protect those things stand together. It should be more clear than ever that we have common enemies -- and the only way we can beat them is to recognize that we have common goals.This is exactly why the Democracy Initiative was founded. A collaborative effort convened by the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, the NAACP, and the Communications Workers of America, we are working to bring together labor, civil rights, voting rights, environmental, good government and other like-minded grassroots organizations with broad memberships to build a movement that will halt the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, stop the suppression of voters, and commit to restoring the basic principals of our democracy.Its a collaboration that is critical given the events of the last few weeks. At a time when some are applauding a shutdown, it is more important than ever that we stand up, and fight back."}, {"title": "Rescued Sea Lions Go Home (VIDEO)", "text": "When a group of hurt and abandoned sea lions washed up on the shore, the ORCA conservation group in Peru swooped in to nurse them back to health.

Republicans have been accused of waging a war against the environment while they deny global warming. We even have Republicans waging a war against the American economy, while some Republicans even deny the deadly economic dangers of a U.S. default.It gets better for Democrats: Now, Republicans are waging a war against everyone. Veterans and military families face hardship because of the Republican shutdown. Small-business people cannot get loans because of the Republican shutdown. Tourists find national parks closed because of the Republican shutdown. It goes on and on and on, which is why Republican polling numbers have been falling like a snowball down a mountain during an avalanche.It gets even better for Democrats: Republicans have been accused of waging a war against the 99 percent, which is bad enough, as Mitt Romney learned the hard way. But now, Republicans are even waging a war against the 1 percent.Think about it: If the debt ceiling is not increased and markets crash, the 1 percent get screwed along with everyone else. And -- this is important -- if the government shutdown continues, consumer confidence and consumer purchasing power go down. Retail sales go down. Sales and earnings and profits of most businesses, large and small, go down. And with the latest GOP scheme for a short term deal, which will continue the sadomasochism in Washington through the Christmas shopping season, the Banana Republicans could ruin the holiday for Mom and Dad, the kids, and businesses across America.Bill and Hillary Clinton represent better days for the economy, and a Clinton presidency that led to powerful economic growth, prosperity and jobs even while the Banana Republicans tried to impeach him. Hillary Clinton represents to voters the ability to lead, the ability to govern, and the ability to grow the economy. If she runs against the Banana Republicans, who are so unpopular today, she could actually win all 50 states in November 2016.

But in 2011, an Ecuadorean court awarded $18 billion to people from the village of Lago Agrio, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees.Donziger and the Ecuadoreans have been unable to collect the award in Ecuador because Chevron no longer has operations there.In 2011, Chevron obtained an injunction from Judge Kaplan in New York blocking enforcement of the judgment anywhere outside Ecuador. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling.RACKETEER ACCUSATIONSIn the lawsuit, Chevron accuses Donziger of violating the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and says both he and the villagers committed fraud.Central to Chevron's case is the evidence of a former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra. Guerra said in a sworn deposition that he often wrote opinions for Judge Nicolas Zambrano, who issued the award to the villagers.Guerra said Donziger and another lawyer pledged to pay Zambrano $500,000 from whatever they collected from the judgment in exchange for allowing them to write it. Guerra also said Zambrano promised to share part of the bribe.Ted Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron, said the proceedings in Ecuador were \"one of the most egregious litigation frauds in history.\"Donziger and the Ecuadoreans say Guerra has no credibility and say he is being paid for his testimony by Chevron. Donziger denies writing the judgment.\"We are completely and utterly denying the allegations by Chevron,\" his spokesman Gowen told reporters on Friday.\"Steven Donziger did not ghostwrite a judgment,\" Gowen said. \"Steven Donziger did not bribe a judge.\"In January, Chevron said it relocated Guerra's family to protect his safety and paid him $38,000 for the costs of providing his evidence. Chevron also confirmed that it agreed to pay Guerra's family $10,000 per month for living expenses and $2,000 for housing.Guerra and Zambrano are expected to testify at the trial, which is expected to last several weeks.Donziger and the Ecuadoreans argue that the relief Chevron seeks - a ban on enforcing the Ecuadorean judgment in U.S. courts or profiting from it in any way - would violate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' reversal of Kaplan's 2011 injunction.They also say they are fighting an unfair battle. Chevron has overwhelmingly more resources. And Donziger and the villagers accuse Kaplan of bias. In a court filing, they wrote that Kaplan's \"contempt\" for Ecuador, \"its courts, and its laws has only grown more prominent over time.\"The 2nd Circuit on Sept. 26 rejected their request to remove Kaplan from the case.Earlier this month, Kaplan ruled that the villagers and Donziger are not entitled to a trial by jury, as they had preferred, because Chevron waived damages claims against them.The case is Chevron Corp v.

Coal demand in the United States, Europe and the rest of Asia will hold steady.Global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25 percent by the end of the decade to 4,500 million tonnes of oil equivalent, overtaking oil at 4,400 million tonnes, according to Woodmac in a presentation on Monday at the World Energy Congress.\"China's demand for coal will almost single-handedly propel the growth of coal as the dominant global fuel,\" said William Durbin, president of global markets at Woodmac. \"Unlike alternatives, it is plentiful and affordable.\"China - already the top consumer - will drive two-thirds of the growth in global coal use this decade. Half of China's power generation capacity to be built between 2012 and 2020 will be coal-fired, said Woodmac.China has no alternative to coal, with its domestic gas output limited and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports more costly than coal, Durbin said.\"Renewables cannot provide base load power. This leaves coal as the primary energy source,\" he said.ASIA TO FOCUS ON LOW-COST COALPower infrastructure provider Alstom estimated that across Asia close to half of the 600 gigawatt of new power generators to be built over the next five years will be coal-fired, Giles Dickson, a vice president at the company said.\"Coal prices are low,\" he said, adding that coal is about one-third of the price of LNG in Asia and about half of the gas price in Europe.Abundant supply is also supporting demand for coal. The traded volumes of coal will increase by a further 20 percent by 2020, Dickson said, including supply of lower grade coal from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa.\"As the lower grade coal comes into the market, further downward pressure on prices will further drive demand,\" he said.Excess supply and faltering demand growth have depressed global coal prices this year. European coal futures have tumbled more than 20 percent, while Australian coal prices have plummeted from the record $130 per tonne hit in 2011 to around $80 per tonne as China's demand grew slower than expected.\"If you take China and India out of the equation, what is more surprising is that under current regulations, coal demand in the rest of the world will remain at current levels,\" Durbin said.High fuel import costs and nuclear issues will support coal use throughout Northeast Asia, while in North America coal is still competitive in many locations despite abundant low-cost shale gas.\"The struggling economy and low coal prices has rendered the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) ineffective,\" Durbin said. \"The carbon price will need to reach 40 euros per tonne to encourage fuel switching, which is unlikely before 2020.\"In Southeast Asia, coal will be the biggest winner in the region's energy mix. Coal will generate nearly half of Southeast Asia's electricity by 2035, up from less than a third now, the International Energy Agency said in early October.This will contribute to a doubling of the region's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to 2.3 gigatonnes by 2035, according to the IEA.

One of the biggest electric vehicle charging companies, Arizona-based ECOtality (a Nissan Leaf partner), went bankrupt, stranding about 13,000 commercial and residential stations. We all have a stake in this, because American tax dollars supported these installations through the so-called EV Project.In the early rounds, only one bidder emerged, an unknown company called Tellus Power, which proposed acquiring ECOtality's assets for just $3 million. Consider that the federal grants totaled almost $115 million (of which almost $100 million was spent) and you begin to see the issue here. There are clear parallels to what happened to the U.S. investment in Fisker Automotive, which went bankrupt after spending $192 million of a $529 million loan (the feds then seized $21 million in assets).But just as I was writing this, the Florida-based Car Charging Group said that it had won the prize, price unspecified. \"We believe this will solidify our position as the leader in the electric vehicle charging industry,\" said Michael Farkas, the CEO. CCG has been aggressively expansionist, and owns pay-to-charge stations in such places as the parking garages of New York City. He's right; this makes the company a big player.One of the issues with ECOtality's bankruptcy was making sure its network remains active, so users can swipe cards and get billed for the electricity. The worst possible outcome would have been to have ECOtality\u2019s 3,300 public chargers (the rest are residential) inoperable because nobody could turn on their billing and operating systems. Nissan was so concerned about the network that it lent ECOtality $1.25 million to get through the auction, spokesman Brian Brockman confirmed.Come to think of it, if those home units didn\u2019t work, that would have been horrible, too. If you see parallels to the big and still-evolving government shutdown, you\u2019re paying attention. It\u2019s not quite veterans unable to get into war memorials, but it\u2019s along the same lines.Brett Hauser, president of Greenlots (which develops open-standard solutions) and a board member of the Open Charge Alliance, was watching the ECOtality debacle. He thinks it\u2019s a clear argument applying open-source standards to all new installed chargers. That would prevent the embarrassing situation in Hawaii, where proprietary chargers installed by the bankrupt Better Place became \u201corphaned\u201d because its new owners, OpConnect, couldn\u2019t find the RFID cards to run them.California, on National Plug-In Day, enacted a law requiring all new chargers to be accessible to credit cards \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t have to join a network to use them. Forrest North, chief operating officer of Recargo, which runs very popular station locator apps (Recargo and PlugShare), points out, \u201cWe\u2019re used to buying things from places like Amazon with just a credit card. These private networks and membership cards have led to nightmarish problems for people who couldn\u2019t get a charge when they needed one.\u201dRecargo actually has its own solution to this, the newly launched Pay With Plugshare (above), which lets you use the iPhone (and Android later this year) app and your credit card to pay for a charge at any participating public station. So far, it has SemaConnect, one of the larger providers, on board. \u201cOur focus is on the driver, trying to make it as easy and seamless as possible,\u201d said North. The Open Charge Alliance, meanwhile, is recruiting internationally (including in Holland, which is very EV-friendly) to get all the EV players give up the idea of proprietary networks.Back to ECOtality. I think Car Charging Group should be a good steward for the company's assets. Internationally, there are much worse scenarios. The aforementioned Better Place left a lot of stranded assets, and so far no credible buyer has emerged for it (though Iceland\u2019s Northern Lights Energy is interested).Tellus Power is a big question mark. The company is based in California, but very low profile there\u2014it\u2019s a subsidiary of a Chinese company called Tusai Holding. A division, Asola, made solar modules for the Fisker Karma, but that didn\u2019t work out so well. Tellus has a website here, but it\u2019s content-free so far.The U.S. government closely scrutinized some potential sales of Fisker (also to Chinese interests), but I didn't see any similar uproar here. Hauser says his Greenlots company has \u201ctaken a look at the ECOtality operation. We want to make sure those stations stay up and are used.\u201d He added, \u201cOur perspective is that, whoever wins, they should continue to have connected stations and make them open source. It\u2019s the only way for the electric car adoption to thrive and prosper.\u201dHere's some pre-bankruptcy video that gives you a fuller ECOtality picture:"}, {"title": "8 Superlative Spiders", "text": "Autumn brings changing leaves, Halloween ghouls and a burst of activity from one member of the natural world that leaves many people cringing: spiders.Read more on Mother Nature Network"}, {"title": "Feds and BP Clash Over Barrels Spilled at Macondo Trial", "text": "This article is published in \"The Louisiana Weekly\" in the Oct. 14, 2013 edition.At the Macondo spill trial, number crunching or quantification of the oil flow started Monday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, with Judge Carl Barbier presiding. The United States is on one side with a figure of about 5 million barrels for the disaster that commenced in late April 2010, versus BP and Anadarko on the other with 3.26 million barrels. By Wednesday afternoon, the feds had rested their case on quantification, and BP began calling its witnesses Thursday.In Monday's opening statement, government attorney Steve O'Rourke said the United States would present four experts using different methodologies. In modeling by these witnesses, principle engineer Ronald Dykhuizen of Sandia National Laboratories considered the well's capping stack data; retired Sandia senior scientist and engineer Stewart Griffiths examined blowout preventer data; University of Tulsa engineering professor Mohan Kelkar used a material balance approach; and Mehran Pooladi-Darvish, senior director at IHS Inc., relied on reservoir simulation. The upshot of these studies was \"they all match up at around 5 million barrels of oil total,\" O'Rourke said.Those four experts used data provided by BP during the spill, and \"they each conclude that the rate at the beginning was about 62,000 barrels of oil per day,\" O'Rourke said. \"By the last day, July 15, 2010, it was about 53,000 barrels. Adding those days up, it was 5 million barrels.\"About 812,000 barrels were collected during the spill by the Top Hat containment device, the capping stack and drilling vessel Helix Q4000, O'Rourke said. That left 4.2 million barrels released out of the five million barrels that exited the well, he said.The fed's science team for the spill included three national laboratories associated with the U.S. Dept. of Energy--Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos, together known as Tri-Labs. The team, led by Sandia director Tom Hunter, offered assistance in the spill response, O'Rourke said.\"The defendants might present a case to you that these Tri-Labs people were just political hacks, put there by the Administration to generate a high flow rate,\" O'Rourke said. \"But Dr. Hunter will come and testify to you that there was no conspiracy, no Administration agenda. They were there to try to get the right answers and to help.\" When BP needed to shut in the Macondo well, it relied on National Labs' calculations, he said.O'Rourke said the defendants won't present a final, daily flow rate during the quantification trial. \"They will nitpick at our experts for sure, but they will not tell you what the actual flow rate was,\" he said.The feds are using the oil industry's definition of barrels in their legal battle against BP. \"In the Clean Water Act, the penalty only applies to barrels, defined as 42 gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit,\" O'Rourke said. \"It doesn't state what pressure. But in the industry, there is a term called stock-tank barrel. And this is 42 gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit at one atmosphere pressure or sea level pressure.\"Barrel measurement starts in the reservoir, O'Rourke said. \"What happens is as these barrels come up and the pressure abates, the gas comes out--comes out as a solution, with off gases,\" he said. \"So by the time it gets to the surface of the water, a barrel down in the reservoir might be only half a barrel of liquid left.\"O'Rourke said in addition to its litigation experts, the government panel known as the Flow Rate Technical Group, assembled by Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, reached a consensus on a 53,000- barrel flow on the final day of the spill. After that, the presidential Oil Spill Commission in October 2010 said a consensus had emerged between federal and independent scientists, using different methods, that roughly 5 million barrels were released.In comparison to 5 million barrels, the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska totaled 262,000 barrels. \"So what we have here is a Valdez worth of oil spilling out every four and a half days,\" O'Rourke said.BP lied to Congress about the flow, O'Rourke said. \"They later told their shareholders in their Securities and Exchange Commission filings that the flow was 4 million barrels, that 3.2 was collected,\" he said. \"With those statements, they are going to come here and tell you that it wasn't 4 million, it was 3.26 million\" or lower. He said BP arrived at its current numbers by cherry-picking data and ignoring information from the spill response.\"At the close of the evidence, your Honor, we will ask you to find as a fact that the beginning of the flow period, about 62,000 barrels of oil per day were coming out; that by the end about 53,000 barrels were coming out,\" O'Rourke said. \"If you add those days together, it was 5 million barrels.\"In his opening, attorney Mike Brock for BP and Anadarko, said during the previous week's source-control trial in New Orleans, witnesses testified about daily changes in the Macondo well during the spill. \"The United States is going to present evidence that relates to a day-by-day calculation over 86 days, when we are in a position where the wellbore is changing daily,\" he said.During the 85 days, many \"geometry changes\" occurred because of the structure of and activities affecting the well, including its riser, metal erosion and junk shots, Brock said. Junk shots were injections of golf balls and other objects to obstruct the flow.\"The government first came out with their flow rate estimate of around 5 million barrels on August 2, 2010 after a few hours of work,\" based on a model that assumed the well geometry had not changed in 85 days, Brock said.Brock said some areas of the oil reservoir weren't connected, and not all of the oil below could flow in the well. But he said the feds assumed one hundred percent flow into the well. \"So that's one big difference that we have with the government,\" he said.He said in late July 2010, the feds were under pressure to come up with a daily and total flow to announce to the public as wild rumors flew about unaccounted-for oil. \"This five million figure that they're using in this case now is one that was designed to be a quick and dirty number for negotiation purposes, but not good science,\" he said.BP has a much lower spill number than the feds. \"It's BP's position that using the industry standard material-balance equation, that the amount of oil that left the well was 3.26 million stock-tank barrels,\" Brock said. The material balance method considers oil in place before the spill, and based on the principle of conservation of mass, calculates the amount that's left in the well afterwards, he said. That's a typical way for industry to figure out what occurred, he said.In testimony Tuesday, Stewart Griffiths, a retired Sandia fluid dynamics and applied math expert, admitted he had no oil industry experience but defended his Macondo model--which is based on periodically measured pressures and flow rates of collected oil, along with fluid dynamics principles--to calculate what spewed over 86 days.Under questioning from government attorney Tom Benson, Griffiths said that before May 8, 2010, erosion of metal parts after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in late April affected cumulative discharge. \"Erosion is a phenomenon that can occur very, very rapidly, and then slows once apertures get opened a little bit,\" he said. After May 8, 2010, the blowout preventer's erosion had little impact on the well's cumulative discharge, he said. Griffiths concluded that erosion in the reservoir and wellbore reduced total discharge only slightly. BP contends that erosion lowered discharge to a greater extent.\"At the end of the day, I have the highest confidence in 5.0,\" million barrels having escaped the well, Griffiths said. \"I've actually checked these calculations more carefully than I have ever checked any calculations in my career.\"On Wednesday, government witness Aaron Zick, a thermodynamic modeling expert, testified about fluid phase behavior. He was followed by professor Mohan Kelkar, who was questioned about his material balance modeling, uncertainty over oil in the reservoir before the spill, and his flow calculation of 54,000 barrels on the last day of the spill.  In testimony Wednesday, Mehran Pooladi-Darvish, a reservoir engineering expert, said his wellbore and reservoir model put total oil released at 5 million to 5.3 million stock-tank barrels.BP started calling its witnesses Thursday. Martin Blunt, Imperial College London petroleum engineering professor, was asked about Macondo reservoir characteristics. He said the share of oil that could flow into the well from the reservoir was between 87 and 90 percent, which is a very good connectivity rate. Nonetheless, in his analysis 3.26 million stock-tank barrels exited the Macondo well in the spill.After a day off Friday and Columbus Day Monday, the trial will resume on Oct. 15. Penalties against BP for barrels spilled will be the subject of a later trial and could be assessed in early 2014. end"}, {"title": "Ubiquitous Plastics, Toxic Sponges Extraordinaire", "text": "Toxic plastic pollution is filling-up the Great Lakes, European lakes and even subalpine lakes in Europe's famed Alps. This insidious byproduct of petroleum has infiltrated the marine food webs and Earthlings are indeed in harms way.It wasn't until World War II that polyethylene (plastic single-use disposable bags, dispensable bottles), propylene (bottle caps, fishing gear) and polystyrene (take-away food containers) were invented, and by the late 1960s being mass-produced. By 1979, the production of plastics in the U.S. eclipsed that of steel. Today, globally humans produce 280 million metric tons of plastic, annually.Plastics are long chains of monomer hydrocarbon molecules. And one of the principle ingredients of all plastics is crude oil. How much? Four percent of the entire world supply or about 3.4 million barrels of oil, each day, are used to make them.Earth's oceans are choking with plastics. It is incomprehensible that each day an additional 3.5 million pieces of plastic enter our oceans or 18 million metric tons of plastic each year.Two summers ago researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Superior discovered that Lakes' Superior, Huron and Erie were crammed with plastic and smaller micro pieces of plastics dubbed 'micro-plastics.' This past summer (2013) they confirmed that both Lakes' Michigan and Ontario were also brimming with micro-plastics.It turns out that the sources are abrasive plastics or micro-beads containing tiny bits of polyethylene plastics used in exfoliants, in face soaps, body washes, toothpastes and other personal care and household products. The particles are so small about the size of one sand grain; they slip through the screens at the wastewater treatment plants and then accumulate en masse in the Great Lakes.Scientists know that both plastics and micro-plastics act as chemical sponges attracting toxins dissolved in water.The Great Lakes micro-plastics' are rife with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BP As), phalates, dioxins and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which are all known to disrupt the human endocrine system and cause cancers and birth defects.Moreover, fish consume these micro-plastics mistaking them for food sources and these toxins are bio-magnified up the food web ultimately poisoning humans who consume fish.In addition many large cities draw their drinking water directly from the Great Lakes.The octillion pieces of plastic and micro-plastics in the Great Lakes can also act as a vector for alien species and diseases like the Vibrio bacteria that causes the pandemic cholera.Sadly, my favorite lake in Switzerland Lake Geneva is also full of plastics. And last week scientists from the University of Bayreuth in Germany found that Italy's largest lake: Lake Garda located high in the spectacular Italian Alps has 1,000 particles of plastic per square meter and 450 pieces of micro-plastics per square meter. Clearly Lake Garda's drinking water has been contaminated. Furthermore, European scientists now suspect that lakes in Bavaria mirror this micro-plastic pollution, which is not only thought to now be European-wide but worldwide.What can each of us do?Refuse to use or accept single-use disposable plastic bags.Refuse to use products that contain plastic ingredients.Please avoid buying beauty or health products that contain polypropylene or polyethylene.If each of us joins together and refuses to buy these products that are poisoning life on Earth -- our purchasing power globally will send a clear message to the manufactures and distributors to stop making these deadly micro-plastic sponges. Please help protect our fresh waterways from pernicious petroleum-based plastics - now!Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and co-author of Life, The Wonder of it All."}, {"title": "The 10 Strangest Fall Traditions In The U.S.", "text": "From AccuWeather's Kristen Rodman:Known for its changing leaves, pumpkin flavors and cooler air, autumn is also the season for some of the nation's oddest customs.
