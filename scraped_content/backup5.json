[{"title": "We Make Progress -- but Need More -- on Climate Change", "text": "While we were experiencing record cold weather in Central New York (-17°F on Feb. 16, 2015), it was hard to assimilate the Jan. 16 New York Times article headlined, \"2014 Breaks Heat Record, Challenging Global Warming Skeptics.\" The article cited the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report that said that, in 2014, the combined land and ocean surface temperature was 1.24°F above the long-term average dating back to 1880. This makes 2014 the warmest year on record.Is it a contradiction that as the Northeast has had a very difficult winter, Alaska has had a modestly mild winter? Would we have thought that temperatures in Texas would be lower on certain dates in January and early February than those in Alaska? Clearly, in 2014, we observed some extreme temperatures in the United States, on both the low and high ends.An article written by Jennifer Francis and Stephen Vavrus in Geophysical Research Letters in 2012 suggested that the loss of Arctic summer ice is adding enough heat to the ocean and atmosphere that it may result in more extreme oscillations of the jet stream. Could the loss of Arctic ice and the more frequent and deeper oscillations be contributing to the more extreme weather we have observed in the Northeast?There is no question that humankind's emission of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, is a major contributor to the obvious global warming trend experienced over the last three decades. And, the atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise with 2014 being the highest, exceeding 400 parts per million (ppm). This is in the context that most climate scientists have suggested that 500 ppm is a critical barrier that will define the impact for at least the next 200 years.I am glad to see some evidence of progress. The U.S. Senate on Jan. 21 voted 98 to 1 to approve a measure stating climate change is real and not a hoax. This is a significant breakthrough. However, a second vote in the Senate could draw the support of only 15 Republicans for a measure that supported the fact that humans contribute to climate change. Despite the obvious, more education is required.Alan Leshner, the chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and executive publisher of the journal Science, has given us excellent advice. Those of us in the sciences need to have genuine, \"respectful dialogues\" with people in order to ensure that \"the opinion gap must not be allowed to swell into an unbridgeable chasm.\" I think that we are making some progress, but is it enough?Another important event occurred Jan. 31: the launch of NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive probe. This $916 million satellite can map the global soil moisture every 2 to 3 days. Although the Earth's soils hold only a fraction of our water, the moisture in soil helps to determine how well plants thrive and sequester carbon in our atmosphere and gives us information on what areas are vulnerable to drought and flooding. We now have another tool to better understand our atmospheric energy cycles.We continue to make progress and must move forward."}, {"title": "Videographer Captures Elusive Green Flash At Sunset On Hawaii's North Shore", "text": "When it comes to the green flash at sunset, people fall into one of two camps: those who have seen it with their very eyes and swear by its majesty, and those who say it's just a figment of our imagination.Hawaii-based videographer Eric Sterman falls into the former, having recently caught the flash while making a time-lapse video of the sunset on the north shore of Oahu. As the last sliver of sun falls below the horizon -- right after a couple of breaching whales make an appearance, because, Hawaii -- the video shows a quick green glint:(Story continues below)NASA explains that the sun could flash green before sunrise or after sunset because the atmosphere refracts the sunlight at that angle:Like a weak prism, the Earth's atmosphere breaks white sunlight into colors, bending red colors slightly and green and blue colors through increasingly larger angles. When the sky is clear, a green flash just above the sun's edge can sometimes be seen for a second or so, when the sun is close to a distant horizon.Because of Hawaii's wide open skies and seemingly endless horizons, the Aloha State offers one of the best chances you'll get to see the elusive green flash. Synchronizing it with beautiful breaching whales, however, might be a touch more difficult."}, {"title": "Enough Distractions: Let's Address the Real Causes of Diet-Related Diseases", "text": "By Adriana Selwyn and Derek YachThe low-carbohydrate diet phenomenon is the latest in a long line of diets claiming to be the solution to rapidly rising rates of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. It comes as no surprise then that on Feb. 19-22, the world's first International Low Carb High Fat Health Summit will take place in Cape Town, South Africa. The four day summit is co-hosted by Tim Noakes, passionate low-carb crusader and proponent of the Banting diet, which has taken South Africa by storm.Following the diet may well result in weight loss, partly because when dietary carbohydrates (pasta, potatoes, fruit, bread, legumes) are restricted, cells have to break down muscle and fat stores for energy, and primarily because of the overall lower calorie intake. However, research indicates any diet that reduces calorie intake, regardless of protein, carbohydrate or fat composition, will result in weight loss and associated metabolic benefits. Essentially, eating less of everything will lead to weight loss.However, when a diet almost entirely eliminates a food group, questions need to be asked:What nutrients are you missing out on?Whole grains, dried beans, legumes and fruit (all of which are to be eliminated or restricted on the Banting diet) provide us with important phytonutrients, vitamins, minerals and fiber. A high fiber intake is associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer.What are you substituting it with?When you reduce or cut out one food group, you inevitably increase consumption of another. In the case of the Banting diet, that leads to more fat. Noakes pays no attention to the importance of the type of dietary fat, but the evidence is clear that reducing saturated fat (found in animal meats, butter, cream) and replacing it with mono and polyunsaturated fat (fish, avocado, olive oil) is best for optimal cardiovascular health and reducing risk of Type 2 diabetes.How sustainable is the diet?How long can an individual sustain such restrictive dietary patterns, and what happens when they crack? A return to former diet habits will likely result in weight regain.One also can't ignore the fact that indiscriminate red meat consumption has negative impacts on health -- ranging from increased risk of colorectal cancer and diabetes to greater risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer -- and the environment.Experiences in South Africa with the Vitality Healthy Food program, where cash-back rebates for healthy food purchases resulted in a shift away from unhealthy foods, offers a unique example of how healthy diets are more sustainable. Estimates of the environmental impact of this shift (specifically purchases of more fruit and vegetables and less beef and pork) show an 8 percent to 13 percent decrease in land use, a 7 percent to 12 percent decrease in water use, and an 8 percent to 10 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.Diets that focus on overall dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet (which emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains, moderate amounts of healthy fats, nuts and fish, and limited intake of sweets and red meat) have clear benefits on health and the environment, and unlike diet fads that come and go, have stood the test of time. Guidelines, such as those from the American Heart Association, are increasingly focused on such dietary patterns rather than recommendations for individual nutrients.More importantly, no single nutrient is responsible for the obesity epidemic. Placing the blame on carbohydrates does nothing but add confusion to an environment already saturated with mixed nutrition messages, and distracts us from addressing the real cause of the obesity epidemic: modern-day environments. Humans have always relied on carbohydrates for energy. Our physiology has not changed over the past 50 years, our environment has; the result being diets high in calorie-rich, nutrient-poor processed foods, and excessive portion sizes.The way to tackle diet-related diseases is to create environments where healthy food is available and the easiest choice; and where small portion sizes are the norm. At the end of the day it is a simple message of moderation. Dr. David Katz insightfully noted that we so often neglect warning signs and root causes of preventable events, only to scramble for solutions once we reach crisis point. So it was with Hurricane Katrina, Ebola and now obesity. We must direct resources towards real solutions, now."}, {"title": "This Pit Bull And Tortoise Are Here To Remind You That BFFs Come In All Shapes And Sizes", "text": "It's just another ordinary afternoon for Sheldon the tortoise and Dolly the pit bull, who are in the yard playing their usual game of chase.\"And, yes, Sheldon is surprisingly fast!\" says veterinarian Cynthia Jones, who is the adoptive mom to the pair.Dolly is a 3-year-old pit who was taken from her previous owners in a cruelty seizure. Jones and her husband, Ray, a law enforcement officer, adopted her about a year ago out of the Humane Society of North Texas, where Jones works.Sheldon, an 8-year-old, 50-some pound tortoise, is a more recent addition to the family -- which also includes another dog, named Daisy, a mini horse and two mini donkeys.He came home about eight months ago, after he was brought to the Humane Society from another shelter. \"[N]o one there knew what to do with him,\" Jones says.Everyone pretty much knows the ropes these days.

Whether we acknowledge it or not, the extreme weather events of last year and early 2015 do not visit economic, psychological and health-related damage upon all Americans equally. We have seen for decades how racism, poverty and other forms of marginalization negatively impact our experience of environmental issues such as pollution and extreme weather.When a superstorm like Hurricane Sandy hits, it does its worst damage to families who lack access to health insurance, rent homes, are un- or under-insured, and generally already overburdened. From winter storms that bring higher heating costs and disrupted services, to summer heat waves that are felt more harshly in urban centers where, research shows, 52% of black Americans are more likely than whites to live in \"urban heat islands\" (dense neighborhoods without access to cooling green space), and can be twice as likely to die during a heat wave.Given this reality, the current discourse around climate resilience--helping communities \"bounce back\" from environmental disasters--must be bold and equitable. As Green for All's 2014 Climate Resilience in Vulnerable Communities report explained so eloquently, \"vulnerable Americans need bolder, more integrated strategies to help them 'leap forward' and find a way to gain ground--not just go back to the margins.\" Climate adaptation measures must be conceived as opportunities to build communities and breathe life into neighborhoods through economic diversification, political empowerment, expanded green space, and better access to healthcare and other resources.Across the country, visionary black leaders (too many to name here) are promoting innovative solutions that foster environmental and communal well-being simultaneously. From legendary leaders like Dr. Robert Bullard, the \"father of environmental justice\", who has spent a lifetime working to bring both academic and public awareness to environmental injustice across the country, from toxic dumping to transportation routing to economic planning; to innovators like Will Allen, the son of a sharecropper and a former NBA player, who has taken community farming to a new level. NRDC recognized Will's achievements in 2009 for his work as founder of Growing Power in 1993 to \"inspire communities to build sustainable food systems that are equitable and ecologically sound,\" thereby improving food security while greening the environment and providing paths to employment. These individuals are among scores of others we must celebrate and look to, not only during Black History Month, but every day of the year: thought leaders who understand that our community deserves better and that fighting pollution can improve health, opportunity and equity in our country.A clean and healthy environment is not a luxury but a right and our moral obligation to fulfill for our children. Children of all colors need a safe and healthy world in which to \"live, work and play.\" According to polling by the Yale Project on Climate Communication, 89 percent of African-American voters somewhat or strongly support regulating carbon pollution, the primary driver of climate change. This staggering level of awareness reflects the experience of black communities, who saw the rates of childhood asthma increase 50% between 2001 and 2009. It also points to an opportunity to bring black leadership to bear on this critical issue, as policy makers seek bold yet nuanced approaches to greening neighborhoods while resisting gentrification. Thanks to President Obama's Clean Power Plan, the Environmental Protection Agency is ramping up efforts to fight carbon pollution and the public health risks that come with it.We in the climate movement must draw inspiration and direction from the history and trails blazed by the leaders who came before us. We must draw from the power and insight from the growing calls for justice and equity like the powerful Black Lives Matter movement to shape just policy across all domains and build our environmental strategies to allow each and every life to flourish. As we reflect on the gains and the daunting challenges faced by the environmental justice community, I am inspired by one of my favorite quotes from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: \"Never, never be afraid to do what's right, especially if the well-being of a person or animal is at stake. Society's punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way.\""}, {"title": "On Terror Alert: Inside Big Oil's Fight To Build Keystone", "text": "The intelligence was alarming: homegrown extremists were said to be targeting the Keystone XL pipeline.Read more on Bloomberg"}, {"title": "'Green News Report' -- February 24, 2015", "text": "The Green News Report is also available via...IN TODAY'S RADIO REPORT: VETOED: Obama nixes Keystone XL pipeline bill; EXPOSED: prominent climate denier researcher funded by fossil fuel industry; BUSTED: Duke Energy clipped by the Feds; Sorry, deniers: Climate change is not caused by the sun; PLUS: It's GNR's 6th Anniversary!....

All the birds were comatose and barely breathing, presenting a medical mystery to the Wildlife Hospital staff.With immediate and intensive medical intervention (see video below), all of the birds recovered, and digestive samples were sent to a laboratory to determine what made them sick. CDFW confirmed pentobarbital exposure in all birds tested, but the source of the exposure remains unknown.Pentobarbital is a drug used by veterinarians to euthanize companion animals, livestock and horses. If the remains of animals euthanized with pentobarbital are not properly disposed of after death, scavenging wildlife - such as turkey vultures and eagles - can be poisoned. Veterinarians and animal owners are responsible for disposing of animal remains properly by legal methods such as cremation or deep burial.Turkey vultures are protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California Fish and Game Code. Improperly disposed-of euthanized remains are a danger to all scavenging wildlife.Members of the veterinary and livestock communities are asked to share this information with colleagues in an effort to prevent further incidents.WildCare also asks the public in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond to pay attention to grounded turkey vultures and other raptors and scavengers.Pentobarbital-poisoned birds appear to be dead. They have no reflex response and breathing can barely be detected. The birds appear intact, without wounds or obvious trauma.WildCare Medical Staff were baffled when the first of these poisoned patients arrived at the Wildlife Hospital. How do you treat a healthy-looking but comatose vulture? Unfortunately the solution quickly became obvious as the bird's crop began to fill -- these poisoned vultures needed to vomit, and Medical Staff would have to help.Watch the video below of WildCare Director of Animal Care, Melanie Piazza helping this comatose vulture to vomit.WildCare is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization supported almost entirely by private donations and individual memberships.

Go Take a Hike.", "text": "When I was growing up in Azusa (whose motto was \"From A to Z in the USA\") back in the early 1960s, we relished the rare days after a winter rainstorm. On those days we could go outside and see snow-covered peaks in the San Gabriel Mountains, soaring 10,000 feet overhead. And while these mountains were only a few miles from my home as the crow flies, it was rare to actually be able to see them. The air pollution was so bad back then we had \"red flag days\" when school children weren't allowed to play outside during recess because of dangerous levels of air pollution.It was 45 years ago that the Clean Air Act passed and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created, and they have both made a tremendous difference in our quality of life. The EPA estimates that without the Clean Air Act, by 1990 \"an additional 205,000 Americans would have died prematurely and millions more would have suffered illnesses ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to heart disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, and other severe respiratory problems.\" In fact, within the Los Angeles basin, levels of some vehicle-related air pollutants have decreased by about 98 percent since the 1960s. If news photos of air pollution in China have you holding your breath, you should explore the archival photos of smog in Los Angeles as a stark reminder of how things used to be.Now we can not only see the San Gabriel Mountains on most days, but we can celebrate their permanent protection as a large natural backdrop to second-largest urban center in the country. Last October, President Barack Obama designated 346,177 acres of national forest lands as the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument provides Angeleños 70 percent of their open space, providing outdoor, nature-based recreational opportunities to 15 million people who live within 90 minutes of the new national monument. In addition to providing access to nature and supporting clean air, the new monument protects the source of 30 percent of the drinking water for the people of Los Angeles.Sometimes the environmental problems we see around us seem overwhelming, so it is particularly helpful to look back at where we've been and to appreciate that Americans have made incredible progress in cleaning up our air, protecting our public lands and watersheds, and ensuring that even in our dense urban cities we have opportunities to get outdoors and commune with nature. Sure we have more to do, but let's appreciate how far we've come; take a deep breath and go take a hike."}, {"title": "Landmark Plastic Bag Ban Officially On Hold", "text": "The nation’s first statewide ban on single-use plastic bags will not go into effect this summer after all. The California secretary of state’s office announced Tuesday that a referendum to overturn the measure has qualified for the November 2016 ballot.The state confirmed that the trade group American Progressive Bag Alliance (APBA) submitted at least 110 percent of the 504,760 verified signatures it needed to qualify its measure to overturn the plastic bag ban, the Los Angeles Times reported. As such, the landmark law is now on hold until California voters weigh in next year.Approved by California Governor Jerry Brown (D) last September and originally slated to go into effect this July, the ban would require grocers to charge at least 10 cents for each recycled paper bag or reusable bag given to consumers. The law also provides $2 million in competitive loans to help plastic bag manufacturers convert their businesses to manufacture reusable bags.The plastic bag industry has argued that the ban has nothing to do with the environment and was a ploy by the California Grocers Association to make money off the 10-cent fee.“Today is an important day for tens of thousands of families across the country that are supported by the American plastic bag manufacturing and recycling industry,” APBA executive director Lee Califf said in a press release. “It’s outrageous that California legislators voted to kill California jobs just to line the pockets of big grocers and their labor union supporters. But the APBA is proud to defend these workers and we remain confident California voters will reject the bag ban scam at the ballot box in November 2016.”Conservationists say they’re sure Californians will uphold the ban on plastic bags. Such bags litter streets and oceans, often killing the marine animals that ingest them, and one impact report states plastic bags could take as long as 1,000 years to biodegrade.“It’s not surprising that after spending more than $3.2 million, 98 percent of which is from out of state, the plastic bag industry has bought its way onto the California ballot to protect its profits,” Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste, said in a press release. “Every poll shows that Californians strongly support the law, and the $30 million to $50 million it will cost the plastics industry to launch a full-fledged campaign in 2016 will be proven to be an act of political malpractice, particularly since nearly half the state will no longer have plastic bags by election day.”More than 100 local ordinances banning plastic bags are already in effect throughout California, and won’t be affected by the hold on the statewide ban.The war against plastic bags suffered another setback this week in Missouri, where Republican state Rep. Dan Shaul -- who also serves as the state director of the Missouri Grocers Association -- introduced a bill that would stop cities from enacting plastic bag bans. He says his dual roles don’t make for a conflict of interest.\"It doesn't affect the organization, it affects the consumer, it affects the industry,\" he said. \"I mean sure, it could be a conflict if you want it to be. I don't think it is.\""}, {"title": "Changing the Way We Think About Water: Q&A With Peter Gleick", "text": "Peter Gleick knows water.An environmental scientist and communicator and co-founder of the Pacific Institute, the MacArthur \"genius\" fellow and member of the U.S. National Academy of the Sciences is an expert on the connections between water, energy, food and health; the impacts of climate change; and international conflicts over water resources.In 2008, Wired Magazine named Dr. Gleick \"one of 15 people the next President should listen to.\" Let's hope the President got his message.I recently spoke with Dr. Gleick on the occasion of the new PBS series EARTH: A New Wild. Wednesday's episode -- the final in the series -- explores people's relationship with water in some of the planet's most spectacular places.Mark Tercek: You're trying to change the way people think about water. What do you mean by that?Peter Gleick: It is time to stop thinking about water as a resource simply to be consumed and to think about how critical it really is for human and ecological survival, growing the food needed by over 7 billion people, countless social and cultural customs, and the production of all the goods and services we consume. Currently we overuse it, pollute it and fight over it. We need to move toward a sustainable water future, where our water needs can be met while protecting and satisfying the needs of the environment and future generations.Mark Tercek: You recently said, \"We have 19th century water policy and 20th century infrastructure, trying to deal with a 21st century climate.\" How can we close that gap?Peter Gleick: Our water systems will have to adapt to the new realities of our world, challenges like climate change, a burgeoning population and new political and social conflicts. That means using new technology to produce and purify water, new economic tools to help pay for the investments needed and new institutions and policies that take into account a rapidly changing world.Mark Tercek: Tell us about your concept of the \"soft path\" for water.Peter Gleick: First you must understand the \"hard path,\" traditional strategies focused on building large, centralized engineered water systems managed by large, centralized institutions. That hard path brought great advantages to society, but also came with significant, often unrecognized costs to local communities and the environment. The \"soft path\" integrates smart use of technology to manage both water supply and demand, innovative economic strategies to help fund new investment and to encourage efficient use and new effective institutions that manage water for a sustainable future.Mark Tercek: In EARTH A New Wild, we visit the Colorado River and the Aral Sea - two places that illustrate your idea of \"peak water.\" Is there any hope for restoring a water source that has reached that limit?Peter Gleick: A growing number of rivers, lakes, and freshwater ecosystems are stressed and stretched to the breaking point - what I call \"peak water\" limits. The Colorado River and the Aral Sea are two dramatic examples. It is certainly possible to restore some flows for the natural ecosystems like the formerly verdant and ecologically rich Colorado River delta, and to try to restore the Aral Sea: in both cases by guaranteeing at least some minimum flows for ecological purposes.But sometimes thresholds are reached or passed from which there can be no return. In the Aral Sea, the 24 or so species of fish that were endemic - found nowhere else on Earth - are now extinct. These can never be brought back and represent the worst consequence of unsustainable water management and use. We must strive to both prevent these kinds of irreversible impacts and to make sure that our water policies benefit both society and our natural world.Mark Tercek: What gives you hope for our water future?Peter Gleick: There is much more attention and awareness about our water challenges today than a few decades ago. As we learn more about the water problems around the world, we also are learning how much people care. Water is so precious and fundamental that individuals and communities are mobilizing to protect their waters, to have a say in decisions for the future and to push to move along a \"soft path.\" Every day I learn about new efforts to find solutions to our water problems, and I have no doubt that we will one day reach a sustainable water future. I only hope we do so quickly enough to be able to avoid the worst of the threats that we face.Images (top to bottom): Water being removed from the Green River for supplying the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, Mato Grosso state, Brazil.

But his journey ends 100 miles short of the sea. Dams, diversions and overuse have turned the river's delta into a parched, sandy desert. Imagine--the mighty Colorado doesn't regularly reach its destination--the Sea of Cortez--and hasn't in over half a century.But this sad story has a very hopeful side. In March of last year, conservationists released a \"pulse flow\" of water that reconnected the river to the sea. Initial reports show that the pulse flow has been successful in recharging groundwater, promoting new vegetation and increasing migratory bird abundance in the delta.The water release was part of a historic agreement between the U.S. and Mexico to implement new guidelines for river management in the face of increasing demands for water. My organization, the Nature Conservancy, was proud to be part of the team that developed this collaborative commitment to save the Colorado River. In a time when water rights often lead to contentious battles, here's a case where diverse groups--federal and state governments, nonprofit organizations, water agencies and funders from two countries--all came together to develop a solution that works for both people and nature. Bravo!And there's more good news: smart collaborations like this are bringing new hope to other watersheds around the world.Take Quito, Ecuador, for example, where the Nature Conservancy worked with unlikely partners to develop a tool called a water fund. Water funds work like this: water users like food and beverage companies, water utilities and farming cooperatives invest in a fund that protects natural lands and helps ranchers implement better conservation practices upstream in order to keep water quality high. In the case of Quito, cleaner water helps the city to avoid more expensive investments in treatment facilities that would otherwise be necessary to remove pollutants. And the upstream conservation activities protect wildlife habitat and also reduce the risk of droughts.The model, which grew out of New York City's efforts to protect its watershed is on track to be replicated in more than 30 sites across Latin America by 2016.We are now applying the concept in Africa and East Asia as well as in the United States where new science suggests that 1 in 4 cities would see a positive return on investment from investing in watershed protection.Just as investing in nature can help cities secure clean and flowing water, it can also help with the problem of too much water. Stormwater runoff and the resulting sewer overflows are a major source of river pollution around many cities--and a major financial burden for already-stressed municipal budgets. Yet natural solutions like green roofs, permeable pavement and healthy wetlands can absorb water and help it flow at a much more manageable rate. Making cities function more like forests may seem like a small solution to an enormous problem. Yet enough green infrastructure in enough places will in fact make a very big difference.This week's episode of EARTH A New Wild is an important reminder that with sound science and smart collaboration we can find new ways to meet our water needs without destroying nature. Nature, in fact, is a crucial part of the solution to our water challenges. From reforesting watersheds to greening cities, nature is integral to a sustainable, cost effective and efficient global water system.Tune in to EARTH A New Wild and visit TNC's New Hope for a New Wild for more on the Colorado River and other great stories about how humans and wildlife can live together in partnerships that benefit both.Images (top to bottom): The leading edge of the Colorado River as it flows from USA into Mexico.

For the past 21 years, The Humane Society of the United States has been encouraging pet owners to spay and neuter their pets during World Spay Day.The Humane Society estimates more than 2.4 million healthy, adoptable pets are put down in the U.S. every year -- that's about one every 13 seconds. But there's a simple solution that can be better for both the increasing problem of overpopulation and your pet's health: Get your four-legged friends spayed or neutered.Americans have made quite a lot of progress over the past few decades and 87 percent of owned cats and dogs are fixed, Vicki Stevens, a senior project manager with HSUS, told The Huffington Post over email. But one of the largest sources for strays are so-called \"community animals\" -- pets that live on the street and don't have loving owners to take care of them.It's a very real problem you can help fix by heading to a local shelter, but without adequate spaying and neutering, healthy animals will continue to show up at already overcrowded shelters.\"Within the next year, nearly 17 million households across America will acquire a new dog or cat,\" Stevens said. \"Clearly, if only a fraction of these households adopt from a shelter, we would save the life of every healthy, adoptable cat or dog. We want pet lovers throughout the country to make shelters their first choice for acquiring companion animals.\"Fixing your pet can be expensive, but there are some solutions for low-income families around the country, like The Toby Project, which provides free and low-cost services to those in the New York City area. Make a call to your local animal shelter to ask what options you can find near you.If you're looking for a companion of your own and are ready for the responsibility, take a look at the ASPCA adoption site or Petfinder.com."}, {"title": "KXL: The End Game Begins", "text": "Surprising nobody, President Obama has quietly followed through on his promise to veto the bill from Congress that would have authorized construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. It's only the third veto of his presidency, and it means the way is now clear for the president to make a final decision about whether Keystone XL and the toxic tar-sands oil it would pump across America's heartland are in the national interest.Why did Congress force the president to waste perfectly good ink reasserting his authority to make this decision? Certainly not because they were looking out for the best interests of the American people, who would be accepting all the many risks associated with Keystone without seeing any appreciable benefits. The more people learn about the project, the more they think it's a bad idea. A poll just released by the League of Conservation Voters found that after hearing arguments both for and against the pipeline, a majority of voters believe President Obama should reject it.What's more, nearly two in three voters (63 percent) say that if President Obama decides the Keystone XL pipeline is not in the nation's best interests, then Congress should accept the decision and move on to other issues facing the country rather than try to force the administration to issue a permit.Seems like good advice. Yet tar-sands supporters in Congress will find it hard to tune out the fossil-fuel interests that want to see Canada's oil sands mined to the utmost. After all, the biggest foreign lease holder in Canada's oil sands is none other than the Koch brothers. And they didn't take their place among the wealthiest people on the planet by taking \"no\" for an answer graciously.But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now it's up to President Obama to do the right thing -- for America, for Americans, and for our planet."}, {"title": "The Keystone Veto: You Want Jobs? Try This", "text": "In the most contentious veto of his tenure, President Obama has rejected legislation that would have cleared the way for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. For now, at least, completion of the 1,200-mile conduit bearing crude from Alberta's oil sands remains on hold. What continues, however, is the debate raging around jobs the project was expected to create.Even before the bill reached his desk, Republicans were lining up to slam the president's veto as a job killer. As The Hill reported:Republicans are eagerly awaiting Obama's stroke of the pen, believing every veto he makes will help them make the case that job-creating legislation is being blocked by a president of \"no.\"If it's all about jobs -- we'll table the climate-change discussion for now -- then let's talk about jobs.The Keystone XL will reportedly create roughly 42,000 jobs, most of them construction jobs lasting about 19 weeks. This sounds like a lot of jobs until you consider that our economy is adding hundreds of thousands of jobs every month, 257,000 added in January alone.Still, 42,000 jobs, even if they're temporary, is nothing to sneeze at. The reality, though, is that Keystone XL is not happening anytime soon. So if this Congress is \"going to keep sending bills to his desk,\" there is legislation the president would likely sign that will produce way more than 42,000 jobs.In fact, there is a legislative proposal that would add 2.1 million jobs to the economy over the next decade without the federal government having to spend a dime to create those jobs.Not only that, but in addition to creating jobs, this proposal would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to levels that could avert the most severe consequences of climate change.The proposal I'm talking about is George Shultz' Carbon Fee and Dividend. Shultz, former Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan, promotes this plan as the conservative answer to climate change, because it won't increase the size of government.It works like this:A steadily rising fee -- starting at $15 per ton of carbon-dioxide -- is placed on fossil fuels at or near the first point of sale, increasing by $10 per ton of CO each year. Revenue from the fee is divided up equally and returned to all households. Border adjustment tariffs are placed on imports from nations that do not have an equivalent carbon-pricing mechanism, in order to maintain a level playing field for American businesses.Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI), a firm that corporations, governments and academic institutions turn to for economic forecasting, conducted a study on the Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal.Here's what REMI found: After 10 years, CO emissions would be cut 33 percent, and 2.1 million jobs would be added to the economy, primarily because of the economic stimulus of recycling tremendous amounts of revenue into the pockets of people who are likely to spend the money.That's right. We can cut carbon emissions while adding millions of jobs to our economy. If you're a member of Congress, trust me: You won't lose votes by passing a bill that puts a check in everybody's mailbox each month.So if this Congress is \"going to keep sending bills\" to the president's desk in an effort to create jobs, make one of those bills Carbon Fee and Dividend. I have a hunch Obama will sign it."}, {"title": "9 Ways My Large Family Makes Me More 'Green'", "text": "A few weeks ago, I published a blog post on HuffPost Parents about how I chose my large family and none of my six boys were \"accidents,\" and here came all the \"environmentalists\" calling names (breeder, selfish narcissist, ho -- for sleeping with my husband, no less!) and whining about overpopulation and bemoaning the state of the earth and its far too many people.It was all really ironic, because I'm actually an environmentalist myself and spent months as a reporter raising awareness about my city's disappearing trees and developers' standard tree-razing practice to build the most houses in the least amount of space.Before I even had kids, I did years of research on how to live frugally, earth-consciously and intentionally so I could raise my family with those values that were so important to me.But this article is not a defense, because the haters don't really deserve that. This article is about the (largely unexpected) ways my half dozen boys have made me green.So, without further ado...1. If it's yellow, let it mellow. They don't flush the toilet. Like, hardly ever. If I want to go to the bathroom, I better be using my own, because theirs has been mellowing for days. And it smells. Saves on: Water and waste water.2. Bath water can be reused. That's right. If one brother has already finished his bath and left the water in the tub, another brother will get in and wash anyway. And while we're on the subject, I'll admit that their daddy and I only have time for showers every two or three days, so... winning. (Don't worry. We make our own deodorant. No, really. All you need is organic corn starch, baking soda, coconut oil and an essential oil of choice.) Saves on: Water, waste water, energy.3. They'll wear the same Iron Man costume with nothing else underneath it for four days straight. Or the same pair of pajamas. Or the same sweat pants. They're not picky at all. They just want to wear what's comfortable. For a week. This saves us the most in the summer, when it's too hot in Texas to wear clothes. They just run around in their  swim trunks instead. Saves on: Water, waste water, energy.4. Paper of any kind is good for drawing. This means their brother's class list for Valentine's Day is a good place to draw that 2-year-old version of a spider. So is that flier for math camp registration and the seven million other pieces of paper that come home in school folders and clutter up our counter. Saves on: Paper waste.5. Sharing is caring. If one pulls out an organic apple and puts it down, another will find it and finish it. No food is wasted around here. And when they're finished, someone will find that apple core and take it outside to plant seeds and feed birds. (We're still waiting for those apple trees to start sprouting, but I hear Texas isn't so great for growing apples, because it's ten thousand degrees here.) Saves on: Food waste.6. They prefer unpackaged foods. Actually, that's not true. Give them a choice between a chocolate bar and a piece of organic fruit, and they'll take the chocolate bar (unless they ask their parents... in which case they'll take the fruit). But their daddy and I stick to the peripheries of the store, so they don't really know what they're missing until they see what's packed in all the other kids' school lunches. They'll thank us later. So will the environment. Saves on: Energy required to package foods.7. What's TV? It's been years since we got rid of cable and threw out the television. Our boys spend their days outside making movies with an old camera or pretending fallen tree branches are light sabers or creating hole-in the-yard art masterpieces their daddy and I will trip in later. Saves on: Electricity, consumption messages spread through commercials.8. Weeds are just another word for flowers. Our boys gather them into a bouquet for Mama. They give them to the neighbor girls. They pick the dandelions and make their wishes. We have no use for herbicides, and guess what? We have the greenest yard on the block. Weird. Saves on: Chemicals leaching into groundwater.9. Energy is free (and plenty). We live half a mile from our boys' school. So we walk or ride bikes or race on scooters. A little more than half a mile down the road is the neighborhood park. A mile down the road is a frozen yogurt shop and a pizza place, perfect for the monthly family night out. After all that, our boys will still have energy left over. One of these days we'll find a way to bottle it up and patent it for selling. Or just drink it ourselves. Saves on: gas, emissions from a car.There are many intentional ways we teach our boys about environmentalism and social justice -- because environmentalism always boils down to social justice. But I did not expect our boys to help us along the journey.So, I can only say to these six wonderful little people: Thank you. You have made the world a better place in so many ways.I'm so glad you're here.  Originally published on Crash Test Parents.

The first three posts can be found in my Huffington Post archive.Illustration by Jonathan Arnold (Arnold Imaging)If we wonder why the international community has labored for 20 years without reaching a final agreement to confront global warming, we might consider what the dominant narrative has been. It has been mostly about constraining progress and apportioning limits.It is time to change the conversation. It should be about a race to the future -- a 21st-century, global Marshall Plan that builds the capacity of nations to achieve sustainable prosperity. Before going into this idea further, let's unpack the invalid logic chain that has been implicit in climate negotiations so far.  It goes like this: 1) Controlling climate change requires dramatic cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions; 2) dramatic cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions require dramatic cuts in fossil-fuel consumption; 3) less fossil-fuel consumption means less economic progress; 4) therefore, mitigating climate change undermines the ability of the world's people to achieve and sustain prosperity.The first assumption is correct. The second can only be invalidated by technical fixes that are not yet ready for commercialization, that add to the cost of energy and that create new problems -- for example, more intensive water consumption and storage requirements for carbon capture and sequestration. Assumptions 3 and 4 result in high-level arm wrestling over which nations can, should and will accept limits on their economic progress.As we might expect, the old logic is reinforced by fossil-energy industries. British Petroleum assumes that fossil energy must remain a major part of the global energy mix to meet the needs of the world's growing population. As a result, BP says, greenhouse-gas emissions will grow 25 percent between now and 2035.ExxonMobil projects that 75 percent of the world's energy will still come from carbon-based fuels in 2040 while only 5 percent will be supplied by renewable resources. In its assessment of climate risks last year, Exxon brushed aside the finding of climate scientists and international analysts that most of the world's oil, gas and coal reserves should remain unburned. Exxon argued that \"the costs and the damaging impact\" of a low-carbon world are \"beyond those that societies, especially the world's poorest and most vulnerable, would be willing to bear.\" In other words, economic progress is not possible without fossil fuels.Other analysts, however, are bullish about the near-term opportunities to fuel economic progress with renewable resources and energy efficiency. They conclude that we now are able to decouple economic development from fossil-fuel consumption in the same way that energy efficiency has decoupled energy consumption from GDP.Well-regarded researchers have concluded that most, and even all, of the world's energy needs can be satisfied by mid-century with sustainable, affordable and readily available low-carbon fuels. Today, in fact, distributed renewable-energy technologies such as solar and wind power are the quickest and least expensive way to deliver modern electricity to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. And as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has written, \"The costs of the policies necessary to make the transition to an economy powered by clean energy are real, but modest relative to the risks.\"What should the new logic model be?First, if climate change is the result of the biggest market failure in history, as Lord Stern has said, then mitigating climate change is the biggest market opportunity.Second, an array of cost-effective energy-efficiency and renewable-energy technologies are ready today to capture that opportunity and produce invaluable social, economic, national-security and environmental benefits beyond cuts in carbon pollution.Third, with the redirection of fossil-energy subsidies, and with an international price on carbon, enough capital exists today to make a rapid transition to clean energy.Fourth, the principal barriers to this outcome are neither economic nor technical; they are the lack of political will, the lack of knowledge and the lack of technical and business capacity.Fifth, climate change is a wicked problem: If we wait until it becomes so severe that it overcomes the lack of political will, its impacts may be irreversible.Sixth and finally, to overcome political inertia, the climate talks must give more attention to practical and affordable ways for nations to capture the benefits and global market opportunities of clean energy. With an aggressive effort to accelerate the market penetration of clean and sustainable energy resources, the world's poorest and most vulnerable people -- the same people who Exxon assumes will not tolerate unburned carbon -- will end up with the most advanced, healthy, competitive, resilient and reliable energy systems on the planet.The reality is that clean energy is the only viable path to progress, and the path is open today. Viewed through the opportunity lens, the future is not carbon-constrained; it is solar-empowered.The Global Commission on Energy and Climate, whose members include former heads of state, former finance ministers and thought leaders in business and finance, estimates that $45 trillion in new energy infrastructure will be needed over the next 15 years to meet the world's energy demands. International trade in environmental goods and services already has reached $1 trillion annually; trade in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency is expected to climb to more than $2 trillion by 2020, 40 percent of it in emerging and developing economies.\"Low-carbon and climate-resilient growth is possible,\" the commission concludes. \"The capital for the necessary investments is available, and the potential for innovation is vast. What is needed is strong political leadership and credible, consistent policies.\"As an outgrowth of climate talks, and as part of longstanding international development efforts, there is a large portfolio of clean-energy technical cooperation programs available to all countries. These programs should be more than tangential to international climate talks; they should be the main event, coordinated in a global Marshall Plan driven by the needs of developing economies but comprehensive enough to meet the needs of all.The objective should be sufficient commitments by all nations for levels of energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural sequestration to achieve aggressive targets for cutting carbon emissions. Several such targets are included in the options negotiators will be asked to consider in Paris, including a peak in global emissions by 2020 and net zero emissions by 2050.In the 10 months before the next climate conference in Paris, and during the negotiations themselves, the United Nations can help change the old narrative. It can encourage nations to go to Paris not only with goals to cut carbon emissions but with commitments on clean-energy development not unlike the renewable-energy standards currently in force in more than 30 U.S. states.The secretary general can set the theme of COP-21 as \"Building the 21st-Century Opportunity Economy.\" Organizers can require that the many side events and exhibits that typically surround the negotiations focus on what the post-carbon world will be like if we put our minds to it. The conversation would engage the power of positive vision alongside the dire warnings of dystopia.One of the principal goals in Paris should be to shape the many existing international development programs into a coherent campaign to build a clean-energy economy -- an economy that no longer accepts oil spills, water pollution, toxic wastes, ocean degradation, dirty air, mountaintop removal, oil wars, weather disasters, or the potential for nuclear proliferation as the price of progress -- between now and mid-century. One place to start is to empower a program such as Sustainable Energy for All, an existing multinational partnership whose goals include universal access to modern energy services.In the final analysis, the only thing that will keep us from building the new-energy economy and doing it in time is the belief that we can't. The recognition that we actually can should become the focus of the international conversation about controlling climate change."}, {"title": "An Introduction to Carbon Cap-and-Trade Systems Around the World", "text": "Carbon markets are being established around the world, but how exactly do cap-and-trade systems work? By answering a few questions on cap-and-trade systems, this piece illustrates why and how such systems are being adopted in practice.What is the point of a cap-and-trade system? Cap-and-trade systems are an approach to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and combating climate change. Market mechanisms, which include both cap-and-trade systems and carbon tax, are preferred by many economists, policy makers, and environmentalists due to their ability to enhance efficiency and innovation. The alternative to market mechanisms is the more traditional command and control approach which includes ambient standards, source-specific emission limits, or technology requirements.But what exactly is a cap & trade system? Industries covered by a cap-and-trade system have a limit or cap on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) or CO2 equivalent GHG they can pollute. Cap-and-trade systems usually start by covering big emitting industries such as power plants, but should eventually include the entire the economy, lowering the cap on pollution over time to continually reduce emissions. Companies that pollute more than their limit can buy carbon credits (aka permits or allowances) that each represent one metric ton of carbon dioxide. Companies will purchase these credits if it's cheaper to buy more credits than reduce their emissions. If companies emit less than their allowance, they can sell their credits to companies that wish to buy more. If it is more cost-effective for companies to reduce their emissions and then sell their allowances, they will do so. Thus, the carbon market is established and credits are auctioned off. One way or another, each year companies have to cover their emissions or a fine is imposed.How prevalent is this approach? Carbon cap-and-trade systems have been adopted by 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions across continents. The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the first and largest in the world, but has seen it's fair share of obstacles and has not been as effective at reducing emissions as many had hoped. Specifically, the price of carbon on the market has been low and when the price is low, there is less of an incentive to reduce emissions. Yet new carbon markets are emerging, others are maturing, and lessons are being learned. 2014 was a big year for carbon markets: Quebec and California linked their existing systems and a sixth province in China, the country that emits the most CO2 in the world, launched a cap-and-trade system. In the first few months of 2015 South Korea opened the world's second largest carbon market and plans are in the works for a system in Washington state.What factors contribute to a successful system? As we have now had time to observe and learn from the various regional and national carbon markets around the world, common characteristics that contribute to the market's success are emerging. Here are some examples:Putting an efficient amount of carbon permits on the market. It boils down to basic economics, but is key for cap-and-trade systems. Too many permits on the market will result in low permit prices. The EU ETS ran into this problem due to the decrease in energy demand during the economic crisis. The lack of demand for permits resulted in an oversupply of them, thus dropping the price of allowances. If not enough permits are available, the price will skyrocket.Credits auctioned off rather than grandfathered in. When a system is beginning, there is strong pressure from industry for a certain number of permits to be allocated for free or 'grandfathered' in and we see the amount of allowances given away vary by industry. This may be politically necessary to get the system up and running, but as mentioned above, too many permits on the markets keeps the price of carbon low and reduces incentives to cut emissions.A floor price or price that one ton of carbon cannot go below. Price floors, or a minimum price per metric ton of carbon, allows for emissions reductions even if the price of CO2 is lower than expected. This also provides certainty and confidence to the market by limiting the volatility of permit prices. The exact price of one ton per carbon will be established by the market and dependent on the amount of permits on the market, but a floor price should be implemented by the government to ensure that the price of carbon is high enough to be felt. The floor should increase annually.Bring industries in over time. This approach is the norm and it works for political as well as economic reasons. By gradually introducing industries into the system, starting with the most polluting ones, people can get used to the system and any kinks can be worked out. For example, Quebec's cap-and-trade system covered industrial and electric sectors in its first phase from 2013-14, then expanded to fuel distributors in 2015.Clearly defined and regulated offset market. A sometimes controversial aspect of cap-and-trade systems is the ability to 'offset' emissions or invest in projects outside the cap-and-trade program that reduce, rather than do so directly. Offsets usually take the form of forestry or livestock projects that limit deforestation and methane flaring. Although the offset aspect of the system can be cost-efficient, it is important that these offset projects are regulated, monitored and third-party verified.New cap-and-trade systems are being implemented using the examples of existing markets and tweaking aspects that proved problematic. For example, in order to prevent a large and inadequate amount of allowances on the market (as was the EU ETS case), the Chinese province of Hubei is attempting to make adjustments in how many credits are allocated after they are auctioned off, after reported emission levels are available. Specifically, RTCC reports that with this approach \"companies that emitted more than 120 percent of the level covered by the free permits could seek extra permits, while those which emitted less than 80 percent of their allocation may have permits withdrawn.\" Preventing this abundance of permits on the market can prevent a crash in carbon prices as well.California also used the EU ETS's low permit prices as an example of what to avoid, when the state implemented a price floor. In California's first auction in 2012, the minimum allowable bid was set at $10, and will increase 5 percent annually, plus the rate of inflation. In the most recent auction in August 2014, the price floor was set at $11.34, and permits were sold at $11.50 ($11.34 for future permits).What are done with the revenues from permit auctions? Many people question where the revenues that were generated from the selling of state-owned GHG emission permits go. Governments often allocate these revenues to projects that will further reduce GHG emissions. For example, California's 2014-2015 budget appropriated $850 million in auction revenue to various state programs, such as sustainable communities programs, clean transportation including funding a high-speed rail, energy efficiency, natural resources, and waste diversion. Governments in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which poses a cap on the power sector in northeastern U.S. states, allocated proceeds to energy efficiency retrofits in low-income apartments and other measures that reduce consumer energy costs.The expanding carbon market is providing best practices for cap-and-trade systems around the world. A credible and functional carbon market is important in today's political context, as governments are still apprehensive in establishing strong climate policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An expanding carbon market can encourage companies that are not yet a part of any cap-and-trade program to voluntarily set an internal price on carbon or to incorporate carbon prices into their management plans, as they anticipate the future market. And of course, reductions in GHGs help countries meet their reduction goals and sets path for addressing climate change internationally."}, {"title": "Why Is the Clock Ticking for a Climate Deal in 2015?", "text": "\"Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', into the future,\" says the lyrics of this classic by the Steve Miller Band, and so does much needed action for the global environment, at the proper speed and scale. However, from time to time, a discontinuity rips away the fabric of policy-time, setting disruptive changes in motion.We saw this happen at the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment , which led the UN to formally establish the connection between environment and development, in 1980 with the launching of the World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which revealed how development is intimately linked to healthy ecosystems, in 1987 with the release of the Brundtland Report (Our Common Future) that further defined the term \"Sustainable Development,\" and again in 1992 with the Earth Summit that became the birthplace of the major international environmental agreements, notably the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).In 2005 the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC came into force as the first internationally-binding accord that set emission-reduction targets for industrialized countries. In 2010, the Aichi Targets were adopted by parties to the CBD in Nagoya, Japan, providing a measurable framework to improve the status of biodiversity globally.Rio+20 was held in 2012, opening the curtains to the ambitious post-2015 sustainable development agenda. This agenda and the accompanying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to be adopted by United Nations Member States at the Special Summit on Sustainable Development this September.As 2015 draws to a close, nations which are parties to the UNFCCC will convene in Paris to agree on a new treaty that can hopefully start reducing the pace of CO2 loading into the atmosphere, which is threatening to set development efforts back by decades.While it is hard to get excited by a string of meetings and a long list of acronyms, they nonetheless point in a forward direction; the world is finally coming to grips with the stark reality that we are pushing the planet's life support systems to their limits and that solutions should not be delayed. For climate change, the 2°C safety threshold is well on track to be transgressed, while for biodiversity, extinction is bound to reach 1,000 times the background rates observed in the fossil record.Vanderbijl Park refinery and a farm land bordering the industrial area. John Hogg/World BankSetting the SDGs and the Paris climate agreement apart from most previous efforts to decide on targets, goals and accords, they are expected to be adopted by all negotiating nations, and not just by a subset of them -- meaning agreeing to a true global effort. In contrast, the Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000 with the target date of 2015, were essentially focused at improving socio-economic conditions in the developing world. The Kyoto climate agreement, on the other hand, was restricted to industrialized countries but mute on commitments by emerging economies such as China and India, which are large emitters.Financing is also paramount. After all, we live in a globalized economy and short-term interests supersede most long-term goals. Helping developing countries to make the transition to low-carbon economies is an essential ingredient to ensure agreement in Paris. The recent pledges to capitalize the Green Climate Fund (GCF), amounting to just over $10 billion, along with some $3 billion in climate-related finance provided by the Global Environment Facility represent a very good start.  There is reason to believe that combined, the SDGs and a solid agreement on climate can start steering spaceship Earth back to its right course. There is a lot riding on the Paris meeting in particular, and we will never have another chance to reach an agreement anytime soon if we fail in December. But if successful, this strategy would also represent a long-sought vindication of the important role that can be played by the sometimes discredited multilateral system, one that can complement voluntary commitments by willing countries, institutions and the private sector, such as those announced in the UN Secretary General's Summit.\"Oh, oh, there's a solution...\""}, {"title": "Watch Adorable Baby Otters Adorably Eating Breakfast", "text": "Breakfast has never been cuter.

Those schools spend close to $8 billion a year on energy costs, the second-largest line item in a school budget after personnel costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 25 percent of the energy used in schools is wasted. In a world of shrinking budgets and resources, energy-efficiency savings in utility costs could be used for desperately needed funding for additional teachers and school resources.Nowhere is this more important than in our nation's poorest school districts, where the concept of a green, healthy school is rarely a priority.Energy-efficient schools are now being lauded as places to be if you want to see improvements in standardized testing, and some studies have shown that students score significantly higher up to 20 percent if they attend green schools In green school, school violence declines, teacher retention soars, and children and their teachers miss fewer days because of illness. Schools are already realizing significant gains from even simple energy-efficient retrofits. Schools from Utah to Tennessee are saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs and improving air quality, which keeps kids minds more alert and teachers more engaged.Richardsville Elementary School in Kentucky received a check last year for $37,000 from the utility company for power it sold back to the grid. But those sorts of energy paybacks could be replicated elsewhere with larger investments, funding that has eluded our nation's most dilapidated and under-performing schools, where the backlog of routine maintenance alone is staggeringly billions of dollars.What if we could secure billions of new private dollars for school energy-efficiency projects in low-income disadvantaged areas and allow the resulting energy savings to remain with each school?The next frontier of green school funding could come from banks through the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a federal law that requires banks operating in low-income areas to invest significant amounts of money in these areas, usually in the form of loans and grants for economic development projects, low-income housing projects and community centers. From 1996 to 2008, banks invested more than $1 trillion in community development and small-business loans in low-income areas in part to score CRA points.Banks take the CRA requirement seriously because the points they earn are a determining factor when regulators review requests for mergers and acquisitions.The litmus test for whether banks will receive CRA points is satisfied only if the \"benefits\" that accrue from these investments remain in the low-income communities.Now the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the banks' regulator, has proposed a clarification that will allow banks to get CRA credit for investing in energy efficiency in low-income communities. This clarification incentivizes banks to give out low- to no-interest loans, or even grants, for green affordable housing and other community projects. These new projects will pass the \"benefits test\" because they will drive down energy costs for projects, centers and housing in the targeted low-income community.The CRA currently provides that some schools are eligible for CRA funding, but only if the schools have fiscal autonomy. Public schools, on the other hand, are ineligible for CRA funding because their budgets are managed at the district or state level, and the benefits do not remain in the community, but rather accrue to the district or state budgets. Low-income-area public schools might qualify for low-interest loans or grants if the benefit stays with the individual school.How would that work? Energy-efficient school renovations routinely result in verifiable annual energy savings, in some cases as much as $200,000 a year. If school districts allowed those energy savings to stay with the individual school rather than reverting to the district budget, the projects would qualify for CRA credits. A typical energy savings project in a low-income community school would result in at least $100,000 in annual savings and a major school greening would result in even more savings, allowing low-income-area schools to buy more science equipment or add teachers.Unlike wealthier schools, our low-income schools do not have outside funding or inside advocates to bring in additional funding. The answer to this disparity lies partially with saving money by saving energy. Leaving those energy savings with the school, which allows banks to invest in energy retrofits under the CRA, would open the door to low-interest loans or grants. It's a win-win proposition for our nation's poorest schools.Rogers is president and CEO Earth Day Network."}, {"title": "Led by European Union, Industrialized Countries to Start Unveiling Climate-Change Strategies This Week", "text": "On Wednesday, the European Union will unveil its post-2020 climate-change strategy, kicking off a 40-day period during which most industrialized nations are expected to upload their strategies to the United Nations web site. By the end of June, every country in the world should have offered its own Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution to the climate challenge, and by October we'll know how they all fit together.24 February 2015 | If you search for \"INDC\" on Google News, you'll learn a lot about what's happening \"in DC\" (the US Capitol) but little about the \"Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions\" that are the linchpin of a revolutionary approach to fixing the global climate mess - and that's a shame, because transparency is a major selling point of INDCs, which are the concrete, specific proposals that developed countries are submitting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through the end of March, with developing countries being given until June.INDCs emerged in the closing hours of the 2013 talks in Warsaw, and they were designed to end the futile 20-year quest for a top-down global climate-change treaty that's designed to be one-size-fits all but almost always ended up suiting no one. In place of that Quixotic quest, we now have a combination of bottom-up and top-down initiatives: INDCs are the bottom-up part, and the treaty currently working its way through the UN process is the top-down part. The two are evolving in an iterative process where developments in one inform the other, and visa-versa. This, however, means that even as countries begin posting their proposed INDCs, it's not really clear what activities will be recognized under the treaty.More clarity should come in June, when negotiators will meet in Bonn, Germany, to finalize the draft text that will be put through one last wringer at year-end talks in Paris. The June text should provide enough clarity for all the world's INDCs to be tweaked and for the UN Climate Change Secretariat to fold them together into a synthesis report by October 1.At that point, we'll add up all the activities and hope they keep the earth from warming more than 2°C.Then, come December, INDCs and the draft text will converge in Paris - the culmination of a massive undertaking that's designed to let individual countries do what they can, but in a way that makes it possible for other countries to compare efforts and that sparks a race to the top as countries vie for positions as climate leaders.And it begins in earnest on Wednesday, when the European Union unveils its INDC.In addition to base and target years, INDCs must outline the scope and coverage of country activities, their planning processes, and the basic assumptions underlying their reasoning.Earlier this month, negotiators met in Geneva to produce something akin to a laundry list of activities that will be recognized as an INDC, but they ended up producing an 86-page wish list that included every idea for an INDC that's kicking around the UNFCCC - including six separate options for land-use alone - but from here through the June talks, it's whittle, whittle, whittle, at least in theory.In the lead-up to the Lima talks, Niklas Höhne, Hanna Fekete, and Markus Hagemann summarized the challenge on the New Climate blog.\"INDCs of countries with similar circumstances will have to be judged by others to be equally ambitious,\" they wrote. \"But how can you judge whether a country's contribution is fair and ambitious in comparison to others, when all 194 countries are very different in development, industrial structure, capabilities and responsibilities - and these aspects even change over time?\"It's a short and quite readable piece that offers five potential indicators and links to several enlightening examples, but for a more philosophical dive, you can turn to \"Comparability of Effort in International Climate Policy Architecture\", a discussion paper published at the very beginning of last year by Joseph Aldy of Harvard and William Pizer of Duke in January.The paper begins by proposing four attributes of a good metric (comprehensive, observable, replicable, and broadly applicable), but its real value is the solid, nuts-and-bolts comparison of ideas that have been in the air for years, and that some countries love and some hate. They look at different ways of measuring emission levels, different ways of thinking about a carbon price, and different ways of using taxes and trade to enforce bilateral agreements to make sure countries don't inadvertently export their emissions.Similar ideas surfaced in a less formal context at the University of Chicago late last year, in a debate over what Milton Friedman might do to combat climate change.If comparability seems overwhelming, check out WRI's CAIT Equity Explorer. It's a nifty tool that lets countries make comparisons based on their levels of development, their emissions, and how vulnerable they are to climate change.For some insight into the INDCs we may see from developing countries, check out \"A Mitigation Analysis of CDKN Priority Countries\", which the Climate & Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) published In July. Published by Helen Picot, Kiran Sura and Christopher Webb, it takes stock of efforts already underway in several developing countries - including India - that together account for 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"title": "IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri Steps Down", "text": "By Alister DoyleOSLO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - India's Rajendra Pachauri quit as chair of the U.N. panel of climate scientists on Tuesday, ending 13 turbulent years in charge of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group, after a sexual harassment complaint against him.Pachauri, 74, has denied the allegation.Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2002, Pachauri pulled out of an IPCC meeting in Kenya this week after Indian police started investigating the complaint by a female researcher in India.Pachauri, whose second term as IPCC chair had been due to end in October 2015, has also suffered cardiac problems.In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, he wrote that his inability to travel to Kenya showed he may be unable to ensure the \"strong leadership and dedication of time and full attention by the chair\" needed by the panel.\"I have, therefore, taken the decision to step down,\" he wrote. His Indian think-tank, The Energy and Resources Institute, also said on Tuesday that he had gone on leave.Forceful in explaining climate science, he has been a repeated target of those who doubt global warming is man-made. Pachauri collected the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 when the IPCC shared the award with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.Findings by the IPCC are the main guide for action by almost 200 governments which aim to agree a U.N. deal to limit climate change at a Paris summit in December. The panel completed a set of mammoth reports last year, the first since 2007.The IPCC appointed vice-chair Ismail El Gizouli as acting chair and promised business as usual.\"The actions taken today will ensure that the IPCC's mission to assess climate change continues without interruption,\" Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, which oversees the IPCC, said in a statement.Pachauri said he had considered stepping down last year after finishing the IPCC reports, which raised the probability that climate change is mainly man-made to at least 95 percent from 90 percent in 2007. Last year was the warmest on record.He rejected calls to quit after an error in the 2007 report exaggerated the rate of melt of Himalayan glaciers. An external review at the time recommended that IPCC chairs should only serve one seven-year term.\"At this stage of the IPCC cycle this is probably manageable ... It's not an existential threat,\" said Jim Skea, a senior IPCC scientist who works at Imperial College in London.He noted that governments approved a negotiating text for Paris this month based on IPCC findings, and that the IPCC had been due to pick a new chair before Paris.\"It's not ideal but he was close to the end of his term,\" said Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics.Candidates to succeed Pachauri include Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of Belgium, another IPCC vice-chair. If elected: \"I would keep robust and independent science at the core\" of the IPCC, he said on Twitter this week.

The photos capturing the moment are absolutely breathtaking.Presidio Trust biological science tech Jonathan Young photographed the fox while following a coyote in the park on Wednesday, he told the Bay Nature Institute. The coyote ran toward the base of a pine tree and looked up, alerting Young to the gray fox balanced in the top branches. Gray foxes commonly make a den in trees, unlike their red counterparts that usually reside in holes in the ground.This is the first time a gray fox has been recorded in the Presidio since 2004, the Trust said in an Instagram.“We thought they were all gone,” Presidio spokeswoman Dana Polk told The San Francisco Chronicle. “This is a big deal.”It was common to spot the species in the park until the early 2000s, when the population of coyotes, which prey on the foxes, began swelling. This fox, Presidio officials told the Chronicle, is either part of a small population that has survived the uptick in coyotes or an animal that journeyed into the city across the Golden Gate Bridge or from the south along Ocean Beach and through Golden Gate Park.“It’s hard to say whether it’s possible to have both of these species occurring in this little park,” Young told the Bay Nature Institute. “Coyotes are pretty mobile animals, and pretty slender, and they can get into some thick brush. I don’t know how that compares to the gray fox, whether the coastal bluffs would provide habitat that would allow them to keep to themselves and keep a safe distance from coyotes.Gray foxes are common in other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, notably on Facebook’s campus in Menlo Park where a family of foxes took up habitat in the tech giant’s zen garden. The company embraced the foxes and earned a Certified Wildlife Habitat designation in 2013."}, {"title": "What to Do With Our Bodies After We Die", "text": "This article was co-authored by Peter Mogielnicki. Peter is a professor emeritus at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, an avid gardener and fisherman, and the proud father of Katrina Spade. He blogs about ideas and the environment on Cereflections.Nature is not a place to visit, it is home. -Gary SnyderHave you ever been faced with difficult decisions after a loved one has died? If so, you most likely worked with a funeral home to decide between conventional burial or cremation, set up a funeral, and make choices regarding embalming, caskets, and urns.While there is a bewildering array of decisions to be made when someone dies, there are relatively few options for the disposition of the body, considering the incredible cultural diversity around us. For the majority of Americans, the only options are conventional burial and cremation. But these methods lack meaning for many, take an environmental toll, and are problematic in urban centers.The issue of decreasing cemetery space has been in the news worldwide. Five years ago a headline in Huffington Post's partner, World Post, read: London Cemeteries So Crowded People Encouraged To Share Grave With Stranger and five months later the New York Times stated: City Cemeteries Declare Gridlock. The cemetery space shortage is not restricted to megalopolises, either. Kelowna, British Columbia (population 108,000) is debating what to do when its cemeteries reach capacity and Boynton Beach, FL (population 68,000), recently considered replacing its Little League field with cemetery plots, (ultimately deciding in favor of the ball field).Interest in alternatives to concrete vaults, toxic embalming practices, rare wood caskets, and the greenhouse gas contribution of cremation has been growing. It is easy to find information about DIY funeral practices, (only relevant if one is fortunate enough to own a few acres in the country), and many more green cemeteries are available now than was the case a few years ago. But as well-intended as these efforts are, green cemeteries still compete for prime real estate and arable land, and they are uncommon in urban areas for that reason.The problem of what to do with the bodies of our deceased will mushroom rapidly as the baby boom generation ages. And why should country dwellers be the only ones who can return their loved ones' bodies to the earth in a personal, gentle way?The Urban Death Project is developing a new option which may appeal to those among us who want to minimize environmental harm and give something back to the earth when we die. It is a system designed for urban settings in which human bodies are transformed into a soil-enriching substance. This choice can also provide a deeply spiritual element for those who see something sacred in the cycles of life and the processes of decomposition and regeneration.The Urban Death Project has designed a system where bodies are laid into a constantly replenished core filled with wood chips and sawdust, then covered with the same material and gently transformed into compost. What happens to a body in an Urban Death Project facility is a lot like what's happening on the top six inches of the forest floor, as organic material breaks down to form precious topsoil.Much like urban libraries or places of worship, each of these facilities will be designed to a unique neighborhood aesthetic, serving the human needs for ritual, contemplation and saying goodbye to a loved one. Inside each building, a central core will serve the common purpose of returning the remains of a loved one to the living earth.The Urban Death Project is beginning its second phase of design development as we speak, and will be launching a Kickstarter Campaign on March 30 to raise funds.

But as the tide of plastic trash rises, so does the real-time impetus to combat the problem.With this goal in mind ninety students -- ranging from 11 to 18 years old -- will gather at Dana Point's renowned Ocean Institute this Friday, for the intensive three-day Plastic Ocean Pollution Solutions (POPS) Leadership Summit.Coming from all over the U.S., as far afield as the Caribbean, India and Africa, these students already grasp the severity of the ocean plastic situation. They won places at the summit based on innovative ideas on how best to: monitor, raise public awareness, and ultimately reduce this non- biodegradable waste.This is one of the most problematic aspects of plastic: its non-biodegradability. Instead what plastic does is photodegrade -- in the presence of sunlight it breaks into smaller and smaller pieces, hence the mind-boggling estimate of plastic particles inundating our oceans. Plastic particles are mistaken as food by fish and filter feeders, so are entering food chains that eventually lead to the world's top predator -- us.With plastic production set to quadruple by 2050 (280 million tons are currently produced annually), and 85 percent of ocean trash being plastic, it's going to be all hands on deck to deal with the coming deluge.No one is more aware of the catastrophe this increased production poses to marine ecosystem health than Long Beach native, Captain Charles Moore. He inadvertently discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- the swirling soup of plastic debris in the Pacific's north eastern gyre -- when he sailed through it on a trip from Hawaii to California in 1997.For the past 15 years Captain Moore has researched plastic and its ramifications on marine life, while also campaigning for remediation of the growing plastic crisis. Captain Moore founded Algalita Marine Research and Education, and believes socially-networked students are the ideal messengers to spread the word.To this end, Algalita's third annual POPS Summit will provide students with a real-life skill set to take out into the world. Workshops include hands-on scientific collection and analysis of coastal seawater while aboard the Ocean Institute and Algalita research vessels. Students will have the chance to take their leadership and public speaking skills up a notch; and explore film-making and social media as community engagement tools.The students will be in good hands for this conscious-raising effort. This year's team of experts and workshop leaders includes: Beth Terry, author of My Plastic Free Life; New York Times best selling author, scientist and ocean conservation enthusiast, Dr. Wallace \"J\" Nichols; Executive Director and co-founder of 5-Gyres Institute, Anna Cummins; youth eco-conscious-raising powerhouses Danni Washington and Jordan Howard; and Captain Charles Moore, whose best-selling book Plastic Ocean is bringing worldwide attention to the phenomenon.What started as a chance discovery of floating plastic debris, become a groundswell, and is now an international movement. Today states are banning single-use plastic bags, and people are rethinking their relationship to a throw-away lifestyle.These ninety students and their twenty-five advisors are tackling burgeoning plastic waste head on, training to become citizen-scientists advocating for plastic trash reduction, and with it their own sustainable future."}, {"title": "Here's What Will Happen To New York City If The World's Ice Sheets Melt", "text": "A disconcerting report released last week revealed that New York City could see a 6-foot rise in sea levels by the end of this century.

Diva, or not, you too deserve safe milk in your delicious, overpriced coffee drink! These coffee giants both purchase milk from large, industrialized farms who feed their cows a diet comprised of genetically modified corn, soy, alfalfa and cotton seed.Plus, a high dose of antibiotics. Non-organic livestock production is responsible for 80% of all antibiotic use in the world, and the dairy industry in particular, uses the strongest and most dangerous forms. As an example, a super potent antibiotic drug used by commercial dairy farmers called Ceftiofur creates resistant bacteria after only one dose.Scott Blankenship, founder and CEO of www.amplifydpledges.com, a social activism startup based in Berkeley, California, is concerned about the health risks. \"Most people are aware that the overuse of antibiotics can create super bacteria no longer resistant to the antibiotics we've come to rely on to save our lives,\" says Blakenship. \"But what's truly frightening and alarming are the numerous and recent scientific studies telling us that this is no longer an apocalyptic theory but rather something happening now, and it's killing people at an increasing rate all over the world.\"Blankenship's latest advocacy platform is inviting coffee lovers to take a stand by asking Starbucks and Peet's Coffee to make the switch to organic-only milk in a unique, easy and powerful way; through the use of consumer pledges. It can be win-win for everyone (consumer and corporation) if the company makes the switch. \"At the end of the day, corporations respond to their financial bottom line,\" says Blankenship. \"Through consumer pledges, we have the ability to positively incentivize corporations to change by increasing that bottom line if they change their behavior, without any risk or effort by the consumer.\"Here's how it works:1. You select the dollar amount you want to pledge.Just what is considered \"organic\" milk? According to the US Department of Agriculture, organic dairy cows must graze in pastures for at least four months per year, their feed for the rest of the year must not have been grown from genetically modified (GMOs) seeds or been treated with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, and the cows must not be treated with hormones or antibiotics.Photo credit: Straus Family CreameryWhy organic? Nutrition:  Studies show that organic food has less cancer causing pesticide residue than conventionally grown crops and more macro- and micro-nutrients. A 2003 University of Washington study found that children fed mostly organic produce and juice had only one-sixth of the level of organophosphate pesticide byproducts in their urine compared to children who ate conventionally grown foods.In 2010 the President's Cancer Panel examined the impact of environmental factors and the use of synthetic chemicals on cancer risks before reporting its findings. Written in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute, the report recommends that American consumers eat food grown without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.And, can we stop thinking about me, me, me? (Unless you are a diva.) And think about the farm workers?The President's Cancer Panel report showed an increased incidence of certain types of cancers by farm workers and their spouses and an increased incidence of leukemia in children living in agricultural areas.Climate Change: After conducting research trials on organic agriculture for nearly three decades on its 333 acres, the Rodale Institute's records show that organic systems' soils, when intensively managed with compost and cover crops, can store more than 2,000 pounds of carbon per acre per year. If all the world's 3.5 billion tillable acres were converted to these biological farming methods, we could reduce global CO 2 emissions by 40 percent.Feeding the World: Globally scientists are finding that regenerative organic farming holds the only sustainable solution to ﬁght world hunger. A recent report to the United Nations drafted by more than 400 cross-disciplinary researchers and development workers drew the conclusion that organic, regenerative agriculture utilizing available and affordable techniques-- such as cover cropping, crop rotation and composting--would serve the people of the developing world far better than imported chemical fertilizer and other outside purchased inputs.Photo courtesy of Organic Valley.Today, I want you to stop thinking that organic food is just for the elite! When you look at its full value, organic food is still a bargain. \"The cost of non-organic food doesn't include the loss of topsoil or crop-disaster relief, health concerns, climate change or dead zones in the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico,\" says the Rodale Institute's Tim LaSalle. \"If you factor in all that, conventional chemically grown food is actually much more expensive than organically produced food.\"Blankenship believes the switch to organic milk would reverberate across the industry.\"Starbucks and Peet's Coffee are such large milk buyers that a switch to organic milk would have a big impact on this critical health problem,\" says Blankenship. \"This would be a huge win for consumers and would be a step forward in safe guarding the effectiveness of the antibiotics used to save human lives.\"To pledge and to watch the latest video from www.amplifydpledges.com on the organic milk campaign, go here:https://amplifydpledges.com/campaign/organic-milkhttps://amplifydpledges.com/campaign/organic-milk"}, {"title": "This Undersea World Will Stop You In Your Tracks", "text": "...meanwhile... from Sandro Bocci on Vimeo.Do we really know what lurks in the deep?

Our small college (I have been on the faculty here since 2005), located in the mountains of Western North Carolina, thus became the first institution of any kind in the American Southeast to join the fossil fuel divestment movement.The movement to divest from fossil fuels has become the fastest divestment campaign in history. To date, over 180 institutions and cities have committed to divest, and about $50 billion has already been divested. Not surprisingly, however, at least in the US, virtually all of this divestment activity has occurred at left-leaning institutions in progressive pockets of the liberal West Coast and Northeast regions of the country.So how did Brevard College, a relatively mainstream institution, located in a conservative area of a flamingly Red State, manage to divest? The short answer is:1. A campus community that is serious about its mission statement: Brevard College is committed to an experiential liberal arts education that encourages personal growth and inspires artistic, intellectual, and social action.  2. Good timing: As Naomi Klein put it, referencing a recent Economist \"Seize the day\" cover with a figure jumping off a pyramid of oil barrels, now is the ideal time to \"Kick it [the oil industry] while it's down.\" Moreover, as reported by Brett Fleishman, a recent \"Peak Carbon before Peak Oil\"article by Deutsche Bank (which has extensive investment partnerships with fossil fuel companies), concluded that the primary driver of last year' plummeting oil prices was not supply and demand, but rather \"climate change consciousness and political momentum.\"\"It's time for us to walk the talk,\" Brevard College President David Joyce told me. \"This is a teachable moment; we teach the students, but the students also teach us. The work they did on this divestment campaign beautifully embodies our mission statement. You see the lights come on in the students' eyes, when they realize they have the knowledge and power to make a real difference...this is why so many of us at this College went into higher education in the first place.\"My colleague Jim (JR) Reynolds, a professor of geology, got the divestment ball rolling on our campus. \"Back in the spring of 2013,\" he recalled, \"a student sent me a link to a website promoting the fossil fuel divestment movement. I immediately saw this as an ideal opportunity for the College because the students were passionate about it and it was in perfect alignment with our mission statement.\"JR worked tirelessly to educate our community about the divestment movement and explain both why we should do it and how it could be done. As first he got the typical response from the administration--we must protect our endowment, we can't take any unnecessary risks, etc. But he doggedly kept forwarding them articles showing that in order for us to have any chance of solving the climate change crisis, most of the world's fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground. As more governments come to understand this, the risk of these fossil fuels becoming 'stranded assets\" will grow. Like many others in the divestment movement, JR thus argued that divesting from fossil fuels was the right thing to do for both moral and financial reasons.Of course, the first group on our campus to fully embrace this argument was the students. They started a divestment petition that was eventually signed by over half of the student body, which in turn inspired a similarly successful faculty petition drive. Last fall, students and faculty presented their petitions to President Joyce and Don Moore, the Chair of the Board of Trustees, during an exceptionally friendly and well-publicized sit-in in the college's library.\"One of the keys to our success was our close relationships with the administration,\" observed Emily Crowley, one of the student leaders of the divestment movement on campus. \"We never saw this as an 'us versus them\" situation, but rather as something that we were all working towards together.\"Board Chair Moore couldn't agree more. \"The students were proactive and respectful,\" he recalled. \"They dialoged with us rather than made demands. They were passionate but also highly professional; they knew what they were talking about.\"Jerry Stone, Chair of the Trustee's Investment Committee, explained that the increasing pressure in the financial industry for 'green investments' has led to new tools and options that enable money managers to achieve goals like fossil fuel divestment without compromising their primary fiduciary responsibilities. \"We concluded that we could divest in a safe and responsible manner,\" he said. \"So we decided to move forward, because we felt that this isn't something that is tangential to our mission--it is our mission!\"We realize that there are many seemingly logical arguments against the wisdom of divesting from fossil fuels. However, we ultimately found the arguments for divestment to be far more credible and persuasive. (For a succinct, thoughtful analysis of the most common arguments for and against divestment, see \"Why We Said Goodbye to Fossil Fuels\" by Donald Gould, Chair of Pitzer College's Investment Committee.)We are also well aware that our successful divestment campaign is only the first step down the long and difficult road that leads to fossil fuel independence. Yet this spring, we plan to take another small but critically important step down this road by installing the first solar panels on our campus.We hope that our small steps will help inspire other institutions and individuals in general, and within conservative areas such as ours in particular, to help speed the transition from dirty, top-down fossil fuels to clean, bottom-up renewable power that works for all of us. In the end, we believe this is in fact the truly conservative approach."}, {"title": "7 People Who Care for Nature and Community", "text": "Whether planting trees in New Orleans or picking up trash in Tehran, one of the most effective ways to heal disaster-struck and neglected places is through community led and driven action. The folks who take care of their local environments and communities are not famous. But we could all learn from their bold actions.Nilka MartellNilka Martell lives in the apartment in the Bronx where she grew up. One morning, after being laid off from work, she stared out her kitchen window at the garbage in the vacant lot across the street. She decided she'd had enough. She convinced her two kids to go out with her and pull out the weeds and pick up trash and dog waste. Neighbors would walk by and ask why they were bothering to clean up a place in the Bronx. But eventually the neighbors joined in and the efforts expanded to planting flowers and trees and taking care of not just the vacant lot but their city block. Today Nilka has her own non-profit--Getting Involved, Virginia Avenue Efforts, Inc., orG.I.V.E. -- and she, along with her kids and neighbors, are expanding their greening efforts to the Bronx's new Concrete Plant and Starlight Parks.Kazem NadjariunAs a child, Kazem Nadjariun spent his summers by Chooret Lake in the countryside north of Tehran. When he returned to Iran after living in Germany for many years, he brought his family to the village and lake he had enjoyed as a kid. But he was disheartened to see the litter along the lakeshore. Like Nilka, he corralled his family into cleaning up the litter. When he posted photos of his family's lakeside cleanup activities on Facebook, Nadjariun spawned what has become the Nature Cleaners movement across Iran. Now working in 31 Iranian states, Nature Cleaners volunteers pick up trash in popular public spaces like parks, historic sites, and amusement parks, and educate passers-by about cleaning up their city and country.Monique PiliéThis New Orleans resident and former FedEx truck driver got to know many of the house-bound elderly residents along her route in the Lower 9th Ward. They depended on her not only for getting their medications but simply for the opportunity to chat. During Katrina, as Monique listened helplessly to the trees crashing down on her home, a wall of water engulfed the Lower 9th Ward drowning the house-bound elderly on her delivery route. Afterwards, seeking solace, Monique quit her job and hiked the 2175-mile Appalachian Trail. Upon returning to New Orleans, she formed a tree planting non-profit called Hike for KaTREEna, and galvanized hundreds of New Orleans residents to plant trees across the city. The trees--and the act of people coming together to plant and care for the trees-- have played a critical role in the resilience of New Orleans.Nam-Sun ParkLike Monique Pilié, Nam-Sun Park has experienced natural disasters. In 2000, she witnessed a devastating forest fire, which left nearly 24,000 acres of forest in ashes and forced residents of Donghae, South Korea to evacuate by boat. Two years later, Typhoon Rusa struck Donghae, leaving dead bodies and debris in its wake. After helping to direct the immediate relief efforts, Park led residents in replanting seaside village groves. Today coastal plants and birds have returned, and the local residents association cares for the trees and conducts annual ceremonies to remember their ancestors at the seaside grove.The Ugly IndianIn India, where it can feel like even the tiniest public space is overrun with garbage and the stench of urine, volunteers join in The Ugly Indian \"spotfixes.\" We don't know their names because they don't allow any one person to take credit for their work. But if you subscribe to their Facebook site, you will know when and where to show up for one of their cleanup actions defying the ugly Indian stereotype in Bangalore, Ahmedabad, and a growing number of cities in India and Pakistan. It is nothing less than a movement of people who are transforming India's eyesores to pocket parks--with planters, pathways, dustbins, and yes, urinals.Dennis ChestnutDennis Chestnut was not allowed to swim in the \"whites only\" pool in his Washington DC neighborhood as a kid. But he claims he got the better end of the deal. Dennis and his friends swam in the local creek, where they encountered frogs and snakes, and learned to love nature. Years later, Chestnut led a community effort to transform the banks of his beloved creek into Marvin Gaye Park. Today, he is a moving force behind multiple community efforts to restore neglected sites in his Anacostia neighborhood, including DC's notorious Kenilworth Landfill and Fort Mahan, which was part of the Civil War Defenses of Washington DC.LaManda JoyIn 2010, LaManda Joy was enjoying a successful career as marketing executive. She would often stop by her neighborhood butcher shop in Chicago, where a photo of a World War II Victory Garden caught her eye. One day it dawned on her that a nearby vacant lot was the exact spot where the Victory Garden had once stood. Shortly thereafter LaManda quit her job to devote herself full time to discovering vacant lots and converting them into Pop-up Victory gardens. Today, LaManda's Peterson Garden Project, named after and inspired by the original Chicago Victory Garden, empowers people to grow their own food and community in eight Chicago community gardens."}, {"title": "The Sun Sets on British Coal", "text": "Long ago, the expression \"carrying coal to Newcastle\" meant to do something utterly pointless, because the city of Newcastle-on-Tyne had a monopoly on British coal exports. But soon, though, carrying coal to anywhere in the United Kingdom will be pointless.On February 14, the leaders of all three of the U.K.'s major political parties announced a joint commitment to phase out the use of coal and fight climate disruption.Specifically, here's what they agreed to do:Here in the U.S., the news got relatively little coverage. That's somewhat surprising -- it's not every day that opposing politicians anywhere (in the middle of an election campaign, yet) set aside their differences long enough to agree on an important, substantive issue. Heck, in this country, we can't even get the Obama administration to agree with itself on the importance of moving beyond coal and other fossil fuels. Even as one part of the administration acts strongly to clean up coal-fired power plants, another part sells billions of tons of coal from public lands at below-market rates.But what happened in Britain is actually a really big deal for several reasons.You can start with the 1,600 lives that will be saved each year by cleaning up the air in the same country that coined the word \"smog\" to describe what was killing so many people. In fact, it was air pollution that led the English to make their first attempt to ban coal burning way back in 1306. Now, more than 700 years later, it looks like they are finally going to make it stick.Next, we can add the U.K. to the growing list of \"if they can do it, why can't we?\" nations around the world. The British may not have the abundant renewable energy resources that we do in this country, but that won't stop them from going \"all in\" on clean energy as they move beyond coal. Just last week, the United Kingdom approved what will be the world's biggest offshore wind farm -- and one of the U.K.'s biggest power stations, period. That's the kind of clean energy project that becomes easier to plan and build when you have market certainty that a nation is firmly committed to climate action -- regardless of who happens to be in power.And you can be sure that the growing list of climate-committed nations will be critical when the next round of climate negotiations begins in Paris later this year. There's a real sense that it's time to put up or shut up, and nations are stepping up in a way we haven't seen in over 20 years of UN negotiations.Finally, although it may seem improbable now, what happened in the United Kingdom gives us a model for what we should expect from our own leaders. Sure, people in the U.K. overwhelmingly support and expect climate action, but not that much more than they do here in the U.S., where a majority of both Republicans and Democrats are in favor of it. The biggest difference may be that the fossil fuel lobby in the U.K. has nowhere near the influence that it does in this country. Plus, although the U.K. still mines some coal, most of what it burns is imported from places like Russia.Given all that, can we ever get the same kind of commitment to climate action from our own leaders of both parties? Yes, if we make it clear that it's important to all Americans. We've seen divisive issues resolve themselves with astounding speed before -- same-sex marriage being only the most recent example. One big thing in our favor: The more that people learn about the benefits of clean energy versus the costs and dangers of dirty fuels, the more supportive of it they become. And those benefits can apply to anyone, regardless of which party they belong to.Most people understand that. Now it's time to make sure that politicians do."}, {"title": "Time to Divest Harvard From Fossil Fuels", "text": "For a week this April, a number of Harvard alumni will return to campus to support the undergraduate fossil fuel divestment movement, and to voice our own support for a change in Harvard's investment policy. Last Friday, a number of alumni released the following letter to call for action at Harvard:Dear fellow Harvardians,We write in hopes that you might come to Cambridge for a couple of days this spring to join in the fight against global warming--in particular, to help students press our alma mater to divest its stock in the fossil fuel industry.Those students have done a remarkable job in garnering overwhelming student support for divestment, and the faculty too have delivered a strong message. But so far the Corporation has not just refused to divest, they've doubled down by announcing the decision to buy stock in some of the dirtiest energy companies on the planet.So the students have asked alumni to join in the cause. In particular, they've asked that we join in a teach-in on Sunday April 12, and then a rally in the Yard on the morning of April 13. Some of us will join the students in highly civil civil disobedience, sitting in peacefully and politely but firmly around Massachusetts Hall; others will rally in support alongside; and others of us, constrained by infirmity or schedule, will join in support on social media and via the phone and email.We'll make a few points that weekend:1. As Harvard's own researchers have done so much to show, global warming is the greatest threat the planet faces. In fact, it's less a threat than a growing reality, as 2014's record temperatures demonstrated. And as Desmond Tutu (honorary degree, 1976) said last year, it's not just melting ice and acidifying ocean, but also the worst humanitarian crisis on earth. From the typhoon-battered Philippines to the disappearing islands of the Pacific to the water-starved towns of California's drought-ridden Central Valley, this issue demands we all make changes to business as usual--especially those of us who have prospered from the systems driving climate change.2. Divestment is effective. After the fall of the white regime, Nelson Mandela (honorary degree, 1989) made clear that the pressure on financial systems when colleges and universities sold apartheid-tainted stock was a key part of South Africa's liberation. Similarly, while we can't bankrupt the oil companies, we can start to politically bankrupt them, complicating their ability to dominate our political life. This fossil fuel divestment campaign--according to an Oxford study the fastest growing such campaign in history--has already helped persuade one of the nation's largest utilities to turn to renewables.3. \"Engagement,\" which the University says is its preferred strategy, hasn't worked. For a quarter century the fossil fuel companies have shrugged off shareholder efforts for major change because, as Bevis Longstreth (HLS TK, and twice a Reagan appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission) points out in a recent series of essays, history shows that companies simply won't shift out of their core businesses without the much greater pressure that comes from divestment.4. Happily, Harvard can meet its scientific and moral obligation without financial risk. Every study shows that fossil fuels have been a drag on endowments for more than a decade; if Harvard had heeded student's' divestment call 18 months ago they would have avoided the recent crash in oil stocks. Indeed, prudent investors are starting to steer clear of fossil fuels because, if the world ever acts to limit climate change, these companies will be stuck with huge reserves of unburnable carbon. In that case, an HSBC study concludes, they will lose half or more of their value. As Mark Carney '87, governor of the Bank of England, recently described this massive 'carbon bubble' as a 'tragedy of horizons' that investors should help avoid.We will come to the Yard in the spring filled not with rancor but with hope. We know from long experience that Harvard eventually does the right thing. In 1869, for instance, President Eliot said, \"Only after generations of civil freedom and social equality will it be possible to obtain the data necessary for an adequate discussion of woman's natural tendencies, tastes, and capabilities.\" 138 years later, his first female successor was nominated, the accomplished historian Drew Faust. And in her engaging installation address, she said something that we firmly endorse:The essence of a university is that it is uniquely accountable to the past and to the future - not simply or even primarily to the present.\"Accountable to the future\" in the present case means acting boldly to divest from fossil fuels, just as Harvard eventually divested from apartheid, from tobacco, and from the genocide in Darfur. We don't have a spare century--we need Harvard to do the right thing now, and not just in its physical plant or its research labs. The endowment is as much a part of the institution as the dining halls or the swimming pool; if we wouldn't build a polluting power plant on campus, we shouldn't be in the pollution business anywhere. So we . We need the Corporation to announce, before the world's leaders meet in Paris later this year for key climate negotiations, its plans to divest Harvard's direct holdings in the 200 companies with the largest fossil reserves on earth. This is not a radical step--already colleges, universities, cities, and denominations around the world have joined in. This summer the World Council of Churches announced plans to divest; in September the Rockefeller brothers, heirs to the first great fossil fuel fortune, announced they would do likewise, arguing that holding on to those stocks would be both financially imprudent and morally unsound.So please join us. We realize that a trip to Cambridge is asking a lot, and that for those willing to sit politely down in front of Mass Hall the outcome is uncertain. But if anyone is to be led away by the University Police, surely it's easier for those of us with stable and secure lives than for students at the start of their careers.

They have come under sustained assault from industry and Republican-controlled Congress – and Berman is right at the heart of it.The attacks may be gaining traction. The EPA chief, Gina McCarthy, suggested in a speech this week the rules were likely to change in response to public comment.From the offices of Berman’s PR firm in Washington, at least five new front groups have launched attack ads against the EPA, environmental groups, fishermen and sportsmen, and green building organisations. The groups all use Berman’s address.Meanwhile, the Employment Policies Institute, a tax-exempt organisation headed by Berman and operating out of his office according to tax filings, funded a series of reports by an ultra-conservative thinktank, the Beacon Hill Institute.The reports, claiming the power plant rules would lead to rolling blackouts, send electricity prices skyrocketing, and devastate local economies, are being published in 16 states by a network of pro-corporate and ultra-conservative thinktanks.All of the reports were funded by EPI, according to Suffolk University, the host institution for Beacon Hill. Suffolk released a list of such grants.Berman did not respond to requests for comment. However, a spokesman, Jordan Bruneau, confirmed that EPI was funding the analyses of the EPA regulations.“Currently IPA is working with economists to determine the effects of certain EPA regulations on particular states,” he said in an email. He said the research was entirely funded by foundations but refused to identify those funders.Those familiar with Berman say he is a prime example of a new industry strategy of bypassing traditional lobbying organisations, and using thinktanks, foundations, experts, and social media to shape the public conversation and – ultimately – legislation.“Richard Berman is very well known for certain front groups and for taking money from anonymous sources to fund aggressive campaigns in the interests of the individuals and the corporations who fund him with the understanding that that funding will be kept secret,” said Nick Surgey, research director of the Center for Media and Democracy.Indeed, Berman claims his ability to hide the funding sources for such campaigns as a particular expertise.“People always ask me one question all the time: ‘How do I know that I won’t be found out as a supporter of what you’re doing?’” Berman told a conference of energy executives last year. The talk was secretly recorded and leaked to the New York Times.“We run all of this stuff through non-profit organisations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity. People don’t know who supports us,” Berman told the energy executives.He claimed at the time to have already collected six-figure sums from some of the companies in the room – and solicited $3m more to defeat opponents of fracking.On such a scale, the funding for an economic study taking down the EPA rules appears relatively economical. Beacon Hill received $41,500 from the Employment Policies Institute for a study of the EPA rules, according to the grants list maintained by Suffolk University.The funds were allocated to produce reports on the impact of the EPA rules in 16 states including: Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Washington Ohio, Alaska and Utah, a spokesman for Suffolk University said.The university spokesman said in an email that the grants followed university protocol. “Suffolk does not accept research funds from unknown sources,” the spokesman said in an email.Beacon Hill is associated with a network of ultra-conservative groups working with the American Legislative Exchange Council and funded by patrons of anti-government causes such as the Koch brothers and Searle Freedom Trust.Its director, David Tuerck, appears on the roster of experts at the Heartland Institute, which adopts an extreme-sceptic position on the existence of human-caused climate change. Tuerck has also featured as a keynote speaker at Heartland’s climate conferences.He told the Guardian he had mixed views on climate change. “I am not certain that those emissions are significant enough to offset other factor changing the climate,” he said. But he was categorical that efforts to cut emissions were “a waste of time”.“We are just heaping unnecessary costs on the American economy,” he said. “It’s as obvious as the nose on anybody’s face these EPA regulations are inevitably going to drive up electricity rates.”Over the years, BHI has been accused of using discredited economic models to exaggerate the costs and downplay the benefits of government regulations.“I think what is dangerous about BHI is that on the face of it appears to be an academic institute producing independent reports but when you peel back the first layer of the onion you find that Beacon Hill often skews reports in favour of their funders,” Surgey said.In 2013, Suffolk University publicly repudiated Beacon Hill after the Guardian reported the organisation told prospective funders its studies could undermine a regional climate change initiative. The claim did not follow Suffolk University rules for grant proposals, the university said.Jay Duffy, a legal fellow at the Clean Air Task Force, said the current BHI analysis of the EPA rules did not meet the usual academic standards. “BHI’s interpretation of EPA’s analysis just doesn’t hold up,” he said. “BHI has skewed timelines, underestimated the social cost of carbon, and overestimated the effect on electricity prices. As a result, their study badly inflates the costs and minimises the benefits of EPA’s draft rules.”BHI defended the study. “Our costs are within the broad range of costs that the EPA produces,” said Paul Bachman, who directly oversaw the study. “It’s just that we don’t include – we exclude – what they call the co-benefits of the proposal.”Berman’s other forays into the environmental arena this year have been hard-hitting.One prime example was the Environmental Policy Alliance – a mirror image of the government agency – which, according to the website, is “devoted to uncovering the funding and hidden agendas behind environmental activist groups and exploring the intersection between activists and government agencies”.The group oversees four projects aimed at discrediting the government agency and environmental and conservation groups.In a full page ad in Politico last year, one of the projects, EPA Facts, asked: “What would you call a radical organisation that threatens to shut down 25% of our electrical grid?” The ad crossed off responses including anarchist, terrorist and militia before coming to Obama’s EPA.Another Berman creation Big Green Radicals claims environmental groups are funded by Russian oil interests close to Vladimir Putin, put up billboards on the Pennsylvania turnpike attacking Lady Gaga, Robert Redford and other celebrities who oppose fracking, and sent a poison Valentine to the fossil fuel divestment campaign.Green Decoys takes on sportsmen and fishermen who support the power plant rules. Leed Exposed opposes green building codes.The outrageous claims are a key part of the strategy, Berman has claimed. “Berman and Company isn’t your average PR firm,” his company website said. “We don’t just change the debate. If necessary, we start the debate.”"}, {"title": "Interior Secretary Has 'Much to Learn' from Kivalina's Iñupiaq Elders on Climate Change and Village Relocation", "text": "Co-authored by Michael Gerace, Re-Locate founder, and P. Joshua Griffin, doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Washington.Photo credit: Colleen SwanLast Monday morning in Iñupiaq Alaska, at Kivalina's McQueen School gymnasium, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell stood from her seat at a table surrounded by community elders, hunters and search and rescue volunteers.\"For the elders that are willing to open up,\" she gestured, \"I'd be very interested in hearing about the changes you've seen on the landscape, how that's impacted your subsistence... [and] where you'd like to see things go for the future.\"Those who gathered shared a wide range of climate concerns ranging from melting permafrost and unstable river travel to ocean acidification and disruption of critical migration routes. Community members talked about intense fall storms, which, because of the late-forming sea ice, have led to severe coastal erosion since 2004. Whaling captains alluded to the spiritual importance of the spring bowhead hunt, made difficult by unstable ice conditions in recent decades.Jewell welcomed these observations of environmental change as helpful \"to supplement the work that the scientists are doing,\" adding, \"You are experiencing things here in Kivalina that we can learn from... so thank you for sharing this with me.\"Yet, throughout the session, elders recounted far more than their observations of a changing landscape. They spoke of enduring more than one hundred years of state intervention -- ever since the federal government forced the semi-nomadic Kivalliñiġmiut nation to inhabit a barrier island at the edge of the Chukchi Sea now exposed to the impacts of climate change.\"The legislatures have failed to see this small community, because it's isolated,\" said Joe Swan Sr. of the Kivalina Relocation Planning Committee (KRPC).\"There's no place to build a house,\" Russell Adams Sr. told Jewell, \"I've got how many families in my house now?...[S]o if you go back, tell your boss, 'you better hurry up.'\"Becky Norton, a member of the Kivalina IRA Council and KRPC added, \"Keep in mind that pretty much each household... has 10-19 people... some in two-bedroom, three-bedroom [homes].\"\"I told my great granddaughter... they will not relocate us for rest of our lives,\" said Lucy Adams, a City Council member. \"We will live without running water for rest of our lives.\"Later on, Jewell conceded, \"There's a lot of parts of my world that interact with you, the Bureau of Indian Affairs... an agency that has a history that's not always been welcomed here, and I understand why.\"A community of over 420 people, Kivalina is widely known as a village \"ravaged\" by climate change. But efforts to move the village off the eroding barrier island have a long history in Kivalina. Just one year after the U.S. government constructed the first school on the island in 1905 -- thus establishing the contemporary village site -- a report to Congress found the school's location to have been \"arbitrarily\" selected. By the fall of 1910, residents \"were beginning to talk of moving.\" The school teacher at the time agreed, writing \"to move would be the wiser if not the safer plan.\"In the decades that followed, residents deliberated village relocation prospects, initiating a formal process 34 years ago as a strategy to meet the village's \"basic needs\" for toilets, running water, adequate space for housing and equitable economic integration.Following three decades of unrealized government-led relocation planning efforts, village leaders and Secretary Jewell alike are asking questions about responsibility and accountability.Rev. Enoch Adams Jr., KRPC Chairman, raised the issue of his organization's unanswered request seven years ago for an audit of \"unsubstantiated\" statements in an Army Corps of Engineers report that brought relocation plans to a standstill in 2006.When faced with a question about setting funding aside for village relocation, Jewell replied that she was \"trying to understand what the state's role is, what the federal government's role is, you know... is there a relocation plan... I can't answer your question because I don't know.\"Throughout the dialogue, Jewell reiterated that she and the agencies she oversees have \"much to learn\" from Kivalina. This learning may include observations of a changing landscape, which Jewell hoped would \"supplement\" climate science, but it does not end there.There is more for policy makers to learn from Kivalina than the important knowledge elders share about the effects of climate change on land, sea and animals. Negotiating the constraints of state-led relocation planning processes, community leaders have developed and are mobilizing a sophisticated and hyper-contemporary understanding of politics, economics and government at multiple scales.Those planning to shape governmental responses to climate displacement should first turn to the experts who live not only at the frontlines of climate change, but at the eroding edge of governmental solutions. Kivalina leaders are composing self-organized institutions, new financial streams, media performances, legal interventions and global partnerships to expand the realm of the possible within the uncertainties of global change.One such partner is Re-Locate, a collective of immersive ethnographic artists and transdisciplinary partners dedicated to understanding and supporting community-led relocation strategies and situational demands through a series of co-developed and co-administered projects that include:● An autonomously operated, locally maintained and mobile biochar reactor sanitation system through a partnership with The Climate Foundation;● Decentralized in-home water and sanitation systems developed for local climatic, geographic, social, and economic contexts;● A digital and physical archive of history and experience in Kivalina, annotated by community members, featuring especially the multimedia record of over thirty years of formal relocation planning;● A Kivalina territorial master plan: an assemblage of encounters and conversation pieces that register, recognize and re-present decisions made by local institutions in Kivalina and community demands related to global climate change, governance and indigeneity;● A series of physical and digital models and maps of Kivalina's territory to be annotated and augmented by community members, artists, and global partners during institutional, individual, and family conversations;● Summits between Kivalina people, artists and guests from climate-displaced communities in Alaska and around the world at the Center for Kivalina Territorial Planning and Global Responsibility for Climate Displacement;● An online and print publication, Re-Lo Magazine, featuring commentary from global theorists; the climate displaced; state, international and NGO representatives; and relocation practitioners from around the world; and● Online participatory documentaries hosting interviews with residents and community-generated media about Kivalina's political history, its relationship to local and global agencies, Iñupiaq traditional knowledge and subsistence lifestyle and the witnessed effects of climate change on the island.While culturally specific and situational, these projects also place the village's relocation efforts within global movements for climate justice and unheard of socioeconomic change. Kivalina's leaders have long recognized that relocation is not just about moving buildings and infrastructure away from climate dangers, but an opportunity to build worlds where particular living beings can endure and flourish.Just as Secretary Jewell was to offer her concluding remarks, Richard Sage, a member of the Kivalina IRA Council, sparked a round of spontaneous applause with his comment: \"Now, all that oil comes from this planet, and all over the world they're taking the oil out of the ground. Now you see all this global change, it's from taking the oil out, in my perspective. We need to stop that oil drilling... we can't just go buy another planet and move to it.\"Disclaimer: Authors Jen Marlow, Michael Gerace and P.

The primary purpose of this effort is to reduce the health risks of air pollution by providing clear, accurate, and timely information to U.S. citizens living and working abroad. This program can also serve as a foundation for cooperation between the United States and other countries on controlling pollution as well as combating climate change. EPA's AirNow system of online monitoring will be used in U.S. embassies starting with India, Vietnam, and Mongolia.The U.S. embassy in Beijing started monitoring PM 2.5 back in 2008, which met with initial skepticism from the Chinese government, but eventually served as a catalyst for major environmental reforms. For example, starting on January 1, 2015, the Chinese government now requires 338 major Chinese cities to provide the public real-time air quality monitoring results for six major air pollutants - PM 10, PM 2.5, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide - as well as the overall air quality index. China's revised Environmental Protection Law, which also went into effect on January 1 of this year, has an entirely new chapter dedicated to promoting environmental data transparency and disclosure.In order for China, or any country, to fight air pollution and climate change, accurate real-time data is essential. We need to know not only what is going wrong but also when things are improving. It is great to see this innovative partnership, born of necessity in China, spreading to other parts of the world.We hope in this Year of the Sheep that all countries will continue building cooperative efforts like this in order to address the formidable global environmental challenges that we all share.This blog post was coauthored by my colleague Winslow Robertson."}, {"title": "Toxic Waste in the U.S.: Coal Ash", "text": "Coal ash, which contains many of the world's worst carcinogens, is what's left over when coal is burnt for electricity.

The other half comes from the melting of snow and ice from glaciers.Glaciologist Anthony Arendt is an author of a recent paper in which researchers used different pieces of information to determine the fresh water input to the northern Pacific from Alaska and northwest Canada. He works at the Geophysical Institute at UAF and studied data from a NASA mission that features two satellites orbiting Earth about 300 miles above our heads.Those instruments measure gravity while racing around the planet in formation about 137 miles apart. Arendt and many other scientists have used this gravity information to calculate changes, in his case the loss of ice and snow from glaciers and massive icefields in Alaska and northern Canada. His data confirmed work done since the 1980s based on stream gauges, weather station data and computer models.By comparison, the Mississippi River drains 31 states and two provinces.

Expressed in part by the phrase \"creation care,\" these leaders believe that protecting the earth is a religious value, and that environmental stewardship is a moral responsibility.In his highly personal 2009 book Gardening Eden, Michael Abbaté puts it this way:\"Imagine the power of a multitude of faithful people who join together to say: This world is a gift from God. We want to pass it on to future generations in better condition than we received it.\"Abbaté, who is a landscape architect and city planner as well as religious thinker, goes on in Gardening Eden to explain how the practice of creation care can lead one to a life of worship and compassion with respect to food, energy, transportation, and green living at home.Some houses of worship, most of them in cities and suburbs, are stepping up big-time to practice what they preach. Through an article written by Caitlin Gibson and published in The Washington Post, I recently learned that there is even a nationwide certification program for congregations wishing to have their environmental leadership recognized. The program, sponsored by an organization called GreenFaith, asks for significant demonstrations of environmental commitment from its participants over a two-year period before full recognition is awarded.I took a look at GreenFaith's certification requirements and was impressed by their substance and depth. These are just a few of the minimums:At least six services over the two-year period focused on ecological themes.At least one interfaith religious/environmental activity each year involving members of at least three religious traditions. (There are environmental statements posted on the website from Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Jewish leaders.)Participation in environmental justice activities, including an advocacy campaign. (The website states: \"We believe that all people deserve a clean, safe environment, regardless of their race or economic status. We know that minority and poor communities suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation. We believe it is the role of religious institutions to advocate for a healthy environment for these communities.\")At least 25 environmental stewardship initiatives (chosen from a comprehensive list), including at least \"one action step and one education step\" in each of four topic areas - energy and transportation; food and water; waste and toxics; and grounds maintenance.An environmental communications plan.Heck, I know environmental organizations that might have room to improve in living up to an audit based on requirements like these. GreenFaith's certification director told Gibson that \"the organization works with more than 4,000 congregations of many faiths across the nation, and 75 of those are a part of the two-year certification program specifically.\"According to the organization's website, \"GreenFaith provides you with extensive resources, one-on-one coaching, support and networking opportunities to help you do holistic and successful environmental programming.\" The website includes pages of suggestions and links on partnerships, divestment and reinvestment, environmental health, \"spirit\" programs designed to strengthen members' bonds with nature, and an extensive \"stewardship\" section covering ten topics from green buildings to waste reduction to energy (including transportation energy) efficiency and more.The organization does not believe its affiliates should shy away from political advocacy:\"GreenFaith believes that political advocacy is an important and integral part of building an environmentally sustainable and just world. The Program does require some form of environmental advocacy, particularly in relation to creating healthy environments for minority and low-income communities which usually suffer the worst effects of pollution. However, we understand that some institutions are uncomfortable with highly political activities, so to make this requirement flexible we do not dictate the issue nor the specific activity centered around advocacy - and we provide resources and support to help your team in crafting advocacy activities that work best for your particular institution.\"In addition to the certification program, GreenFaith sponsors an intensive \"religious-environmental training program\" for clergy or lay leaders who wish to undertake deeper commitment and study. Its board and staff include members of multiple faiths. (Read about the organization's founding and history here.)Gibson's article in the Post highlights three DC-area congregations that have engaged the program, including the GreenFaith-certified Kehila Chadasha community, led by Rabbi David Shneyer. Rabbi Shneyer told Gibson that the congregation is passionate about environmental advocacy and education, \"whether that means petitioning elected leaders for environmentally progressive legislation or screening former vice president Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, on Yom Kippur.\"On the latter point, Shneyer is particularly eloquent:\"On Yom Kippur, we're asking for forgiveness for our wrongdoings. Well, the way we treat the Earth is certainly worthy of noting, and asking for forgiveness and working toward relating to the Earth in a better way.\"Grace Episcopal Church of Silver Spring, Maryland (an inner suburb of Washington, DC), which has significantly greened its building and programming operations, is another congregation featured in the article. The Rev. Andrew Walter, the church's pastor, said that he believes that the movement's time has come:\"My sense is there's a growing awareness of environmental issues in the wider culture and society, and as that's happened, there's also been a growing theological understanding in the church. Here at our own congregation, it's sort of a no-brainer -- people just immediately understand that the Earth comes from God, and we need to care for it.\"I have written about connections between faith, environmentalism, and urban communities before. The subject interests me in large part because I grew up in a religious community in the South. My hometown has a freeway named after Billy Graham, and I even remember going to tent revivals as a kid. I was raised Protestant, but attended a Catholic elementary school and eventually even a law school at a university founded by Jesuits. Although I am no longer a practicing member of any particular faith, I have great respect for those who are.And I have always seen a deep connection between religious and environmental values. My own environmental instincts came originally not from science (though I am certainly a believer in science) but from a sense of wonder about natural beauty and the landscape. I don't see the environment as a political or technical issue but as a moral and ethical one, in great harmony with the principles I learned in church as a kid. I think it's fantastic that the connection is becoming more institutionalized through an organization such as GreenFaith.I'm pretty sure that Michael Abbaté, the Christian writer whose quote appears at the top of this post, would agree. After Gardening Eden came out in 2009, he honored me with an interview, and this is what he had to say on the point:\"With 83% of Americans claiming some type of spiritual faith, and 75% of Americans believing that the environment is worth making financial sacrifices to protect, it is clear to me that a majority of Americans are motivated both by faith and the environment. . . .Amen to that.Move your cursor over the images for credit information.Kaid Benfield writes about community, development, and the environment on Huffington Post and in other national media.

Edible mold in cheese or sauerkraut is totally acceptable, but with tempeh, it's still a little weird.\"Gunter knows weird.

This happened 30 years ago. \"It was Michigan, 1980, the previous recession,\" says a wry Gunter. \"You could either drink yourself to death, jump off a bridge or do something constructive. I decided to make tempeh.\"Now you can find packaged tempeh at natural food stores and even some supermarkets.

Others may fear tempeh, but they were tempeh true believers from the start, mold and all.\"We thought it was great,\" says Betsy, a vegetarian trying \"to get away from eating too much cheese.\"\"I was into sausages,\" says Gunter. \"It was the substitute for my meat habit, my sausage habit.

While larger companies sell tempeh in bricks, they shaped theirs into patties, selling to neighboring food co-ops and nearby restaurants, who couldn't keep up with tempeh burger demand.\"We've done demos in supermarkets where people gave us a hug and said, 'Oh, thank God, you saved my life -- I've got vegetarian teenagers or a husband with a triple bypass.' We've had other people say, 'I'll eat my meat and die early, thank you.'\" Gunter sighs. \"Being way ahead of our time is very lonesome.\"If Betsy and Gunter had the vision -- and cojones -- to make tempeh before the world was ready, you can at least try eating it. Buy a brick. Better yet, try making it yourself via Gunter's DIY tempeh technique. Make it for personal consumption. Go into business and make a fortune. Though retired from the tempeh biz, the couple remain the Johnny Appleseeds of tempeh, wanting to spread the joy and the soy.

Apparently, by the end of the century New Yorkers will have ample reason to lose sleep. I view these projections as possible yet avoidable scenarios. New York City is spending $20 billion to help ensure it can adapt to a more difficult future, but if the panel's prediction of two feet of sea level rise comes to pass, we will need many multiples of $20 billion to protect New York. These projections should be seen as probabilistic warnings, not certain predictions of the future. There is little question that we must adapt to a changing climate, but we still have the ability to mitigate climate change and reduce the impacts of humans on the planet's ecological and climate systems.Some of the change will need to come in the developed world, as we transition to a fossil fuel-free economy. But much of the change will need to come in the developing world as they hopefully leapfrog over our technological path to a new one that avoids some of the mistakes made by developed nations. Currently the key nations to watch are India and China, and while we have moved backward over the past decade, there are signs of change in the air--especially the air in Beijing and Delhi.China and India's rapid economic development has been accompanied by a massive increase in coal-fired power plant construction and a dramatic increase in air pollution. While many scientists are focused on the relationship of coal to greenhouse gases, many decision makers worry about the growing impact of air pollution on public health. Last week, in an effort to provide data and focus attention on air pollution, the U.S. EPA and State Department announced they would build on the air quality monitoring program implemented in our embassy in Beijing by adding air monitors to U.S. embassies and consulates in India, Vietnam and Mongolia.In an excellent piece on air pollution in New Delhi, New York Times reporter Gardiner Harris observed that:For years, this sprawling city on the Yamuna River had the dirtiest air in the world, but few who lived here seemed conscious of the problem or worried about its consequences. Now, suddenly, that has begun to change...The increased awareness of the depth of India's air problems even led Indian diplomats, who had long expressed little interest in climate and pollution discussions with United States officials, to suddenly ask the Americans for help in cleaning India's air late last year, according to participants in the talks. So when President Obama left Delhi after a visit last month, he could point to a series of pollution agreements, including one to bring the United States system for measuring pollution levels to many Indian cities and another to help study ways to reduce exhaust from trucks, a major source of urban pollution.Harris' story reported on the health effects of India's toxic air and noted that according to the World Health Organization, India has \"the world's highest death rate from chronic respiratory diseases, and more deaths from asthma than any other nation.\" As in China, the growing awareness of the health impacts of air pollution is beginning to move air pollution from the fringe of the national political agenda to the center.While both the economic development process and the movement to control air pollution rolled out slower here in the United States, the process we are seeing in India and China mirrors the one we saw in this country between 1950 and 1970. In the U.S., it culminated in an era of creative environmental legislation starting with the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969, and continuing with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in 1972, and laws regulating solid and toxic waste through the 1970s and 1980s. Pollution control then was seen as an issue of public health. In today's highly mobile global economy, a clean environment is also a prerequisite of economic growth. People and businesses faced with a toxic environment will move to places that are less toxic. We also live on a crowded, more resource-stressed planet today than we did forty or fifty years ago. The environment was an important issue in 1970 America, but it is a central issue in today's global economy.Moreover, the elite in the developing world can fall victim to the same diseases that afflict poor people. No one--rich or poor--wants to see his or her children harmed by a toxic environment. And the people who run China and India cannot run away from their capital cities and still continue to exercise power.While controlling conventional pollutants is not the same as reducing greenhouse gases, there is a strong correlation between these two forms of pollution. When fuel switching is used to control pollution and switch from coal to pretty much anything else, greenhouse gases are reduced. More importantly, the awareness of the health impacts of conventional pollutants helps increase awareness of other forms of environmental damage caused by fossil fuel use. This includes climate change, as well as ecosystem damage and loss of biodiversity. The best hope for bringing these pollutants under control is increased awareness and understanding of the total cost of fossil fuel use.In the United States, visible environmental destruction of the land, air and water helped build a deeper public understanding of the causes and effects of environmental damage. One might call this a stage of development. Once basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter are assured, people start to think about issues that once might have seen like luxuries. Intellectual stimulation, culture and entertainment become important; as does nutrition, physical fitness, health and psychological well-being. When a developing nation's elite travels to the United States and Europe and sees wealth without pollution, their tolerance for environmental insults is reduced. The argument that pollution is the price of development seems less plausible, and in any case, the fear of disease and death increases political support for environmental protection.Measuring and disclosing pollution levels is a critical element of air pollution control. In the United States, the web site Airnow.gov provides daily reports of over 4,000 air-monitoring stations throughout the United States. According to the Airnow site:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Park Service, tribal, state, and local agencies developed the AirNow system to provide the public with easy access to national air quality information. State and local agencies report the air quality index (AQI) for cities across the US and parts of Canada and Mexico.This resource ensures that journalists and the public have real time access to air quality data at all times. This access helps drive accountability and provides motivation for government vigilance and enforcement. Airnow International is now under development, and a growing number of international air monitoring stations are posting their data on this site.The growing movement to control air pollution in China and India gives us reason to hope that the dire projections of New York City's sea level rise released last week may not come to pass. New York is not the only coastal city that is under threat. Most coastal cities face similar challenges. Most cities are located by coasts and, as of 2007, most of the planet's population resided in cities. This trend is expected to accelerate throughout the 21st century. I know that New Yorkers will never abandon their city. To continue to live here we will need to reduce the amount of global warming that scientists now project, and adapt to the climate change that is already here. I am confident that we will somehow manage to accomplish these goals. Humans are an ingenious species and we somehow always find a way to stumble forward."}, {"title": "Ecopolis Iowa City: Will Riverfront Park Showcase Bold Leadership on Resiliency, Climate Action?", "text": "(All photos courtesy of Miriam Alarcón Avila)When the UN Climate Summit kicked off last fall with the short film, \"What's Possible,\" actor Morgan Freeman's challenge to \"our leaders to be brave, and their choices to be bold\" resonated with Iowa City residents, who filled a record six million sand bags along the Iowa River during the historic 2008 flood.Nearly seven years later, as the city formalizes plans to rebuild a new Riverfront Crossings Park in a flood-prone area slated for urban renewal, diverse groups of artists, local food entrepreneurs, permaculture advocates and community organizations took part in a forum on Feb. 21 to shape a bold Riverfront Park that reflects the city's commitment to resilience and climate action.The special event was hosted by the Ecopolis Forum, a growing movement of numerous groups in Iowa City advocating for the city and community to build on current sustainability efforts and work collaboratively on regenerative city initiatives in the areas of local food, renewable energy, and restorative urban designs.On Monday, Feb. 23, the City Council of Iowa City will be asked to set a public hearing on plans for the demolition of all structures, including the historic PWA-era Control House on the former site of the North Wastewater Treatment Plant, which will make up a large part of the proposed Riverfront Park.\"Everyone agrees that creating a resilient city is common sense,\" said Fred Meyer, a nationally recognized permaculture expert and director of the Iowa City-based Backyard Abundance. \"What we need now is common action. These Ecopolis Forums help galvanize residents, organizations, and city staff to take common sense actions.\"Meyer and Jenna Ladd, a former University of Iowa student gardener and environmental coalition leader, presented an overview of recent studies on climate change, including drought, and flooding in the riverfront area, and design possibilities for regeneration and restoration.City park plans include a wetlands restoration area, among other proposals. However, due to funding restrictions, according to a recent city memo, \"it is likely the future park site will sit as vacant grassy land for a number of years.\"(Riverfront Crossings District area, Iowa City)Forum participants broke into four discussion groups: Food, medicine, materials; water, river and creek restoration; resilience and permaculture; and an Ecopolis Center for the arts, environmental education and demonstration area.Part of this vision for a bold Riverfront Park includes the preservation and renovation of the historic PWA-funded Control House on the edge of the waste treatment plant as a public center for the Park, especially during the several winter months of minimal outdoor use.\"As a culture we discover and build our narratives on the art, artifacts and architecture of previous generations,\" said Louise Rauh, an Iowa City artist. \"Repurposing the PWA-built Control House into a community center where art, ecology and entrepreneurship meet will articulate the path Iowa City intends to take as far as preservation and sustainability and provide a strong visual gateway to the proposed development in this area.\"For many residents, the construction of the Control House in 1935 serves as a cautionary tale for the development of today's Riverfront Park: With generous federal funds and financial support from the University of Iowa, the historic Control House building and waste treatment plant emerged from a city outcry over open sewage and its impact on the Iowa River and community health.\"The undeniable urgency to address climate change today presents a similar challenge to our city and riverfront,\" said Carla Paciotto, an Iowa City resident. \"Are we going to ignore the lessons of history--and destroy historic buildings--or are we going to make sure we do all that is possible to preserve historic landmarks and incorporate them into our climate action plans for the future?\"(Iowa City residents at Ecopolis Forum on Riverfront Park)That future for many forum participants begins with the Iowa River and the Riverfront Park.\"People have their back turned to the very river that gave rise to this city 175 years ago,\" said Mel Schlachter, with the Iowa River Friends organization. \" The University has had its back turned. The City has had its back turned. Most citizens and candidates for city office know it only as a threat, and remember people by the hundreds filling and laying hundreds of thousands of sandbags in 2008.\"Schlachter added:\"Yet, you start to tell a story about the river, you pull out a photo of people swimming and boating in it in times past, you talk about the brown trout that used to swim in it and the mussels in it right now struggling for life; you talk about the guy who pulled out a 30 pound catfish by city park or describe a white water rapids that could go through a roller dam; you talk about your own kayak out there, and people start to turn, to turn and have another look at the river. You see the whisp of a thought that maybe it is not beyond reclamation, maybe we can find ways to enjoy it now and work for better later on. Now they are facing it. Maybe our City and University can be part of it again. The Old Capitol does look out at the river, after all.\""}, {"title": "Climate Questions From Smart Young Students", "text": "One of the perks of my job is answering emails from high school and junior high students doing their first research projects on climate change science, policy, and politics.A little while back, I got an email from a 14 year-old Virginia middle-schooler named Emily, who was working on a debate project about global warming. She asked me the six good questions below, and I thought I'd answer them via this post. But first, my apologies to Emily for taking so long - her debate probably has already taken place. I hope these responses will help some other students with their assignments.Emily, our personal choices and habits matters. Mine aren't perfect, but here are a few things I do and don't do. I drive a hybrid car, and I bike to work when the weather is mild (good exercise). In our home, I have installed energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, EnergyStar appliances (like our refrigerator and dishwasher) and energy-efficient LED and compact fluorescent lights. All those things help us use less energy, and using less energy creates less pollution--less carbon emissions from burning gasoline in our car, and less carbon emissions from burning coal and natural gas in the power plants that supply electricity to our house. I'm also a regular recycler, which the city's once-a-week pick-up makes easy--it takes just a fraction of the energy to make new cans from old empties, and to make new newsprint from yesterday's papers. Using less energy means we put less carbon pollution into our atmosphere, warming the planet and disturbing our fragile climate system.Individual consumers have a lot of power, and when they demand more efficient cars, lighting, appliances, etc., companies respond by making those products. But we're all busy doing our day jobs, and taking care of our families or going to school - and just looking for an hour a day to relax. It's too much to ask everyone to bone up on what's the most efficient product, and to do the dollars-and-cents calculations about whether the payback in lower gasoline or electric bills makes the extra front-end cost for this or that product worthwhile.That's why it makes sense to have energy efficiency standards that make it easier for people to protect their pocketbooks and the earth we all depend on. Let me give you an example: Energy-efficient light bulbs can help us save a huge amount of electricity and money. Still, for decades, the lighting industry kept making the same kind of bulbs that Thomas Edison invented more than 100 years ago. And those bulbs waste most of their energy making heat, rather than light.So in 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that set efficiency standards for light bulbs, with support from both Democratic and Republican representatives in Congress, and from President George W. Bush, who signed the bill into law. Companies have responded by making LED and other kinds of bulbs, in every shape and size, that give off just as much light for a fraction of the electricity. (They don't waste power turning it into useless heat.) The lightbulb standards in this law will save Americans a total of $13 billion a year and avoid the amount of pollution that would have poured out of 30 large power plants. And the light they produce - for a lot less electricity - is just as pleasing as from Edison's old incandescent bulb.Same story for our cars. In recent years, under the Clean Air Act and the Energy Independence law mentioned above, the federal government has set standards for new cars that will double how far they go on a gallong of gas and cut their carbon pollution in half -- all while saving car owners thousands of dollars at the pump.That's how our clean air and clean energy laws can help us go beyond our individual actions, to help out the environment and save money at the same time.I gotta go with scientists. You hear from some TV pundits and politicians that the science is uncertain, or that global warming is an out-and-out hoax. But I listen to the climate scientists. More than 97 percent of the world's climate scientists tell us that by polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, we're heating up the planet and changing our climate.One of the best summaries of climate science comes from the American Association for the Advancement of Science - the publishers of this country's pre-eminent science magazine, Science. Their summary of climate science is called What We Know: The Reality, Risks and Response to Climate Change..And we don't have the opportunity for do-overs. Unlike ordinary air pollutants, which disappear from the air in just a few days, carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping pollutants stick around in the atmosphere for very long times. Carbon dioxide, for example, stays there for more than 100 years. It just keeps building up, like continuing to fill a bathtub with a really slow drain. Which means your generation will have to live not only with the carbon pollution you emit in your lifetime, but also with the pollution your parents and grandparents put up there too.Bottom line: Climate scientists are as sure that carbon pollution causes global warming as medical scientists are sure that smoking causes cancer. And increasingly, climate scientists are getting really alarmed. They know time is running out to head off the worst impacts, and they are as frustrated as can be by the political forces that keep the public confused.So, to answer your question: If the vast majority of climate scientists were to say these changes weren't happening, or were just part of a natural process, I would believe them. Unfortunately, that's not what they say.Here's the good news, though: If we act now, there are still lots of things we can do to help protect your generation, and the ones to follow you, from the worst impacts.Emily, it's hard to say which effects of global warming will be the harshest. They all sound pretty bad--increased heat waves, wildfires and droughts. More severe hurricanes. Disruptions to agriculture, making food more scarce and expensive. The poorest countries and the poorest people are already suffering the most. But impacts are already happening everywhere, and all of us will feel climate change's effects.And in this interconnected world, the poorest countries don't suffer in isolation. When a hurricane hits the Philippines, we see it on TV, and it touches us all. But it's not just on our TV screens. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a \"threat multiplier,\" because it undermines countries' stability and aggravates the conditions that in too many places lead to refugee crises, civil unrest, and even war. Leading scholars and journalists, such as Tom Friedman of the New York Times, argue that higher grain prices, brought about by droughts and floods in places as remote as Russia and Australia, helped trigger the unrest across the Middle East that we call the Arab Spring.If we keep polluting at our current rate, over the next several decades, when you'll be in the prime of your life, we'll see a lot more climate disruption. That's why groups like NRDC are working hard at the national, state, local, and international level to make sure governments, businesses, and people everywhere change course--cut pollution, stop cutting down the world's really important forests, and move to cleaner energy. There's still a lot we can do to prevent the most terrible effects.The most important thing we can do to keep global temperatures down is to cut the carbon dioxide pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for electric power, transportation, and industry. Here in the U.S., nearly 40 percent of our global warming pollution comes just from power plants, and another 20 percent from our cars. That's why the EPA's Clean Car Standards and its Clean Power Plan are so important. These are the biggest things we can do right now to cut carbon pollution.There are lots of great ways to cut power plant pollution. Energy efficiency--using less energy to do the same stuff, like those energy-efficient light bulbs we talked about--is one of them. Here in the U.S., we waste a mind-blowing 60 percent of the energy we use, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have calculated. We've got the technology and the know-how to do a lot better.Switching to renewable energy, like wind and solar power, is another great way to keep the earth's temperature down, because wind and solar power don't add to the pollution in our atmosphere.It's also important to cut down on the amount of methane--the main component of natural gas--that leaks into our air from the pipelines and other oil and gas equipment that brings natural gas to our houses. And that we replace refrigerants called HFCs with new coolants that, when they leak into the air, don't contribute to more climate change. Recently, President Obama announced proposals to get started on both those things. But there's more to do.Saving forests is extremely important, too. Right now, deforestation--the cutting down of forests--is responsible for 15 percent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution. (When trees are cut down, most of the carbon they contain gets released into the atmosphere.)You can get the low-down on the science from the What We Know publication I mentioned earlier. It draws on the world's best reports, like those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.This is not something we discovered only yesterday. Scientists first discovered that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere in the mid-1800s, before the Civil War. And 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson first called on us to curb the carbon dioxide pollution that's causing climate change. Since then, the evidence that global warming is happening and caused by human activity has become so overwhelming that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the most authoritative group of scientists from around the world, has said \"scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\" In other words, science has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that global warming is definitely happening and we're causing it.The climate changes we've witnessed in the last 30 years can't be explained by computer models that describe normal weather patterns and temperatures. Only when greenhouse gas concentrations are factored in do the computer models reproduce the changes scientists and regular people observe.Unfortunately, even if we stopped polluting the atmosphere overnight, it would still take a very long time to completely reverse climate change's effects--perhaps a thousand years, given the technologies and natural processes available to us now. As I explained, once in the atmosphere carbon dioxide emissions stay there for more than 100 years, soaking up heat every day. Scientists are researching ways to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The current best technology for doing that is reforestation--planting new forests. Maybe we can improve on that.For now, the best thing we can do is to start cutting our carbon pollution now, and transitioning to a clean energy future. That's why NRDC wants to ramp up the use of clean energy and pollution-free cars and trucks fast, both here in the U.S. and around the world. The less pollution we put in the atmosphere now, the more we can slow down the impacts, and the more time we'll have to come up with better ways to get rid of the stuff.* * *Emily, I'm so glad you wrote and I hope these answers help other students -- even if they came too late for your debate. There'll be many more chances for you to debate global warming, and what to do about it."}, {"title": "Deeper Ties To Corporate Cash For A Doubtful Climate Scientist", "text": "For years, politicians wanting to block legislation on climate change have bolstered their arguments by pointing to the work of a handful of scientists who claim that greenhouse gases pose little risk to humanity.Read more on The New York Times"}, {"title": "Great Dane Puppy Struggles Mightily To Pick Up Frisbee, Jumps On It Instead", "text": "We can't tell if this Great Dane puppy is pouncing on the Frisbee in joy, or sheer frustration.Either way -- and despite the dog's enthusiasm -- the technique doesn't seem to be working very well.When you don't have opposable thumbs, few things can be as bothersome this toy.Keep at it, buddy.

Bitter cold is also expected, but conditions should start to ease in many areas by mid-morning, the service said.Boston, which had already been hit by 98.7 inches (251 cm) of snow going into the weekend, saw only about an inch Saturday, but local weather watchers there were forecasting the total tally to hit 100 inches by midnight. The city's total is well above the average yearly total of 31 inches (79 cm).The new round of harsh weather is part of a system that has cut a curving, 2,000-mile path from southern Missouri to Maine.Snow and ice contributed to major delays at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York Saturday, with some arriving flights delayed more than two hours, and flights destined for Newark International Airport in New Jersey were delayed more than three hours, according to a Federal Aviation Administration advisory.Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings were in effect until Sunday for parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire, the NWS said.The system dropped steady snow on Washington and Baltimore as it pushed up the East Coast Saturday. West Virginia saw 18 inches of snow, according to state officials.NWS warned that \"structural collapses\" are possible for rooftops overloaded with the persistent snowfall. Maryland State Police said people had abandoned their vehicles along interstates and roadways.Nearly a week of cold and ice has contributed to 18 weather-related fatalities in Tennessee since Monday, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.

That's the conclusion of a watchdog group's analysis of more than 130 documents distributed to policymakers by industry representatives.\"Research and statistics can be manipulated to say whatever the person using them wants to say,\" said Robert Galbraith, an analyst with the nonprofit Public Accountability Initiative and co-author of the report released on Wednesday. Public Accountability Initiative, which describes itself as a non-partisan advocate of corporate and government transparency, receives some financial support from groups opposed to fracking.Energy in Depth, the oil and gas industry's education and public outreach arm, presents its list of documents as evidence of the safety of a process that has been \"closely regulated and extensively studied.\" The industry used the documents to persuade the Allegheny County Council in Pittsburgh in May to lease mineral rights under its Deer Lakes Park for gas drilling.Public Accountability Initiative's analysis determined that only one of the industry studies was both peer-reviewed and explicitly addressed public health concerns. That study was funded by the industry. Also on the industry's research list: retracted studies, industry PowerPoint presentations and blog posts. Omitted were hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies of fracking and potential impacts to the environment and public health.The oil and gas industry group responded to the Public Accountability Initiative accusations with an attack, alleging that fracking opponents are responsible for their own share of deceit, denial and deflection in trying to align research with their arguments.\"This report comes just weeks after [Energy in Depth] revealed that a research paper touted as peer-reviewed science -- and used to justify New York's ban on shale gas development -- was actually written and peer-reviewed by anti-fracking activists,\" Katie Brown, a spokeswoman for Energy in Depth, told The Huffington Post.So, who are the real liars and cheats?Teasing out the truth isn't easy for policymakers or the public. In fact, it's a predicament common to a range of public health issues going back more than 100 years. Experts noted that a small but vocal number of scientists as well as some industry groups continue to borrow from a playbook first drafted by lead paint manufacturers in the early 20th century and expanded by Big Tobacco in subsequent decades. The tactics are chock full of legal and public relations tactics designed to preserve profitability, they say.As HuffPost reported Wednesday, manipulated science can pose serious public health harms. Manufactured data, concealed conflicts of interest and misleading conclusions are evident in influential research on vaccination, organic food, secondhand smoke and industrial chemicals.Fracking apparently is no exception.Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, highlighted a 2013 industry-funded study that concluded living close to fracking wells did not increase the risk of childhood cancer.\"They used the wrong time interval to be relevant for how long it takes childhood cancers to develop. Of course, they weren't going to find any cancer,\" said Rotkin-Ellman. She pointed to a rebuttal titled, \"Obfuscation Does Not Provide Comfort,\" later published by two experts in the same journal that contained the original article.\"This is a common symptom of industry-funded science -- a set of conclusions that are not supported by the study as it was done,\" Rotkin-Ellman added.Another example of potentially misleading misinformation came in November 2014, when University of Colorado researchers published a paper outlining a technique to trace a subset of the components in fracking fluid so groundwater contamination could be identified in the future. They did not actually test for toxicity. But the title of the institution's press release declared, \"Major class of fracking chemicals no more toxic than common household substances.\" Media coverage followed the lead, and Energy in Depth declared that the research supported fracking as a safe technology.A study held up by the New York state health commissioner on Dec. 17, as the state announced its decision to ban shale gas development due to potential public health risks, has sparked controversy as well. The industry called the work a \"violation\" of the ethics of scientific research.The \"anti-fracking activists\" behind the writing and reviewing of the study, said Energy in Depth's Brown, \"concealed their bias from the scientific community and the general public.\"In a statement to HuffPost, the co-founders of Concerned Health Professions of New York, Dr. Kathleen Nolan and Dr. Sheila Bushkin-Bediant, defended the study. They noted that the reviewers had no financial conflicts of interest to disclose. Further, their names -- as well as their reviews -- were publicly available with the report, as were the affiliations of some of the study authors with \"non-profit organizations whose mission is to reduce exposure to toxic chemicals.\"The \"real focus of this discussion,\" Nolan and Bushkin-Bediant added, should be on a library of 447 peer-reviewed studies created by Anthony Ingraffea, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University, and the non-profit Physicians Scientists & Engineers for Healthy Energy.Infraffea said the fact that there's \"very little overlap\" between his library of studies and Energy in Depth's list \"screams that something is wrong here.\"Ingraffea and his team published a report in January that analyzed the subset of scientific papers addressing environmental and public health impacts of shale gas production. They concluded that the \"majority of studies indicated negative impacts.\"Energy in Depth's \"hollow attempt to discredit one of those 447 peer-reviewed studies is clearly an effort to distract and deflect from the significant weight of evidence showing health and other serious impacts of drilling and fracking,\" Nolan and Buskin-Bedient said.Overall, the Public Accountability Initiative report found only 10 of Energy in Depth's highlighted studies had been both peer-reviewed and void of industry ties. And with many of those 10, said Galbraith, it was a stretch to say the research even addressed the possible impacts of fracking.One of the studies, for example, was a survey of trace elements conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s, before the shale gas boom had begun.\"This shows how important it is to have a full picture,\" said Galbraith. \"Where is your information coming from? What does it really say?\"Energy in Depth's Brown told HuffPost that the list Public Accountability Initiative attacks \"is in no way exhaustive.\" When asked if the industry group had a more exhaustive list to point to, Brown replied, \"Ah, we don't at the moment.\""}, {"title": "Let's Talk About Solar Power and Equity", "text": "We need to have \"the talk\" about solar power and equity, because ignoring uncomfortable questions will invite misinformation and bad decisions. We need an informed dialogue about how local solar power (large-scale and rooftop) can impact low-income communities and communities of color in the U.S. We need to talk about \"all the good things, and the bad things, that may be.\"First things first, the price of solar panels has fallen by 80 percent since 2008. Because of this significant decrease in cost, coupled with enabling policies like net metering which allow customers to send the energy they produce from their solar systems back to the grid and receive a credit on their bill, and the emergence of new financing models like solar \"leasing\" programs, the U.S. has seen an explosion of local solar.We now boast an estimated 20 gigawatts of solar energy nationwide (enough to power more than 4 million U.S. homes), and the United States added more solar capacity in the past two years than in the previous 30 years combined. In fact, as President Obama highlighted in his State of the Union address, \"Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.\"So who is benefiting from this solar boon? According to an analysis from the Center for American Progress, mostly middle-income and working class homeowners:Rooftop solar is not just being adopted by the wealthy; it is, in fact, mostly being deployed in neighborhoods where median income ranges from $30,000 to $90,000.The growth of the solar industry is also creating good jobs, and plenty of them. The solar industry added jobs nearly 20 times faster than the national average in 2014, and solar employment has increased 86 percent in the past five years. Solar installers make an average of $20 to $24 per hour, and solar salespeople can make $30 to $60 per hour. And, as I have written before, solar and other clean energy jobs are generally more accessible to people of color and folks without advanced degrees.Not to be overlooked are the environmental benefits of solar: this clean energy resource helped offset an estimated 20 million metric tons of harmful carbon emissions in 2014, the equivalent of taking four million cars off U.S. highways. The environmental benefits of solar are particularly important given that approximately 68 percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant (with similarly large numbers for Latinos) and a recent study claims that nearly 40 percent of communities of color breathe polluted air.While all of this news is encouraging, it does not fully answer important questions about local solar access and affordability for low income people, renters, and communities of color -- constituencies that greatly overlap.There is no easy answer, but fortunately this issue has been a priority for many lawmakers and advocates (Environmental Defense Fund included) who are working to find solutions. A community solar pilot project in Los Angeles, for example, will empower residents to own a share of a local solar garden without installing panels on their own roofs. This has the potential to reach 51 percent of the population in L.A. who rent, and large swaths of residents who can't afford their own solar system. These and other policies can create access and affordability for people who otherwise could not join the clean energy revolution -- and we need to get these policies right.But, in the meantime, we also need to be on the lookout for misinformation and bad ideas.Enter the \"solar hurts low-income people\" argument, which claims that low-income people are paying higher bills to subsidize solar power they can't afford -- and thus advocates lawmakers should oppose it. This argument is misguided and missing critical information. Even worse, many iterations of this argument come from bad influences: industry groups representing investor-owned utilities, who are trying to protect their profits by attempting to pit low-income communities against clean energy.To be clear, asking important questions regarding clean energy and equity is productive; so is pushing lawmakers to find solutions that work for all communities and don't place unfair, burdensome costs on low income people. What's unproductive is misinformation and conjecture. We need real, unbiased data and analysis on the costs of solar to customers and the grid. To start with, here are a few solar stats to consider, all from reputable sources:So why would some industry groups want to slow the growth of local solar? (Spoiler alert: THE MONEY) The Berkeley study linked above found that local solar will have significant impacts on utility shareholder profits -- up to a 40 percent loss for some. It seems clear that the efforts to attack local solar are more about disruptions to utility profits than negative impacts on low-income people.And, thus, we arrive back where we started: let's not decoy, avoid, or make void this topic. We need to ask complex and sometimes uncomfortable questions when it comes to local solar power and equity. It's ok to not have all the answers figured out ahead of time, as long as we learn together and arrive at solutions based on real information. But it's not ok to allow misinformation and bad ideas to lead us to making the wrong decisions."}, {"title": "Perfecting the Snap: A Prize Designer's Observations From the Field", "text": "By Stephanie WanderStephanie Wander is a Prize Designer with XPRIZE. During her two years with the Foundation, she has worked on the designs of the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, the Global Learning XPRIZE, and the proposed Personal Aerial Vehicle and Tissue Engineering XPRIZE competitions. Stephanie is a proud graduate of the UCLA Anderson School of Management and a Board Member of Clifford Beers Housing.In the wake of an epic Super Bowl, the 14 competing teams of the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, The XPRIZE Oceans Operations Staff, and I descended on Seattle--home of the Seahawks-- for phase 3 coastal trials. We had not anticipated the daily sea of purple-clad aquarium visitors streaming by our outdoor tank at the Seattle Aquarium. The \"12's,\" as Seahawks fans describe themselves, now looked on as scientists gently lowered the teams' pH sensors into the tank and secured them with sailor's knots. The $2 million Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE competition for the most accurate and easy-to-use ocean sensors was now in play.If innovation were football, the goal of XPRIZE is to perfect the snap. We try to set up the best possible conditions for our competing teams to succeed. When we do it right, we are rewarded with incredible plays and revolutionary breakthroughs. Breakthroughs like the creation of the first reusable, privately funded, manned spaceship that paved the way for the $2 billion private space flight industry; the development of the 100 MPGe industry standard for automobiles; and a quadrupled oil recovery rate, which redefined oil cleanup in the wake of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.For the remaining teams in the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, this phase is the second round of field-testing and a critical down-select. Fourteen entries are competing for one of five deep-sea ocean deployment slots--the final test before XPRIZE declares the winners. For me, this is the culmination of two years of work at XPRIZE as a Prize Designer (the Ocean Health XPRIZE Visioneering was my first project with the organization).Sunburst Sensors' entry in the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZEAs a Prize Designer, I think a lot about impact. From the impact we want to see in the world, we define the problem we want to solve. I have been privileged to ask, \"How should this XPRIZE impact the world?\" for prize designs in Ocean Health, Global Learning, Autonomous Personal Aerial Transportation and Tissue Engineering.With each of these designs, prize designers evaluate and customize a competition to maximize a number of impacts. For the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, our impact goals included encouraging the development of improved technical, scalable solutions, engaging communities of experts, innovators and the public, and positioning competing teams for success in a new industry. My role in the field is to ascertain if we are achieving those impacts. I keep an eye out for evidence, such as cross-team collaboration, innovation, plans to scale solutions, and community engagement.The energy and focus of teams is palpable as they prepare for deployment. One quickly sees that each team is its own fiercest competitor. Teams are quick to lend a tool or piece of advice, and quicker still to share their plans for the next prototype or eventual commercialization of their sensor. One team (Team Durafet) composed of industry stalwarts and leading scientists even went so far as to contribute to the crowdfunding campaign of a team of composed of high school students (Team pHFinescale). I am not sure there is a better example of the power of an XPRIZE to inspire disruption.The sensors hanging in the testing tank at the Seattle AquariumA quick conversation with Team SmartPhin, whose sensor is designed to attach to a surfboard fin, revealed that they are supported by an art foundation, the Lost Bird Project. This foundation sees artistic expression in tapping the surfing community to capture ocean data. Where they see art, we see a chance to transform the \"quantified self\" movement into the \"quantified earth\" movement.As part of our early design work, Prize Lead Paul Bunje and I had many conversations about the kinds of teams that might compete: had anyone used mass spectrophotometric (light-based) approaches? What about other industries? Could biomedical or agricultural sensing communities be sitting on a solution for better pH measurement of our oceans? It turns out they might be: several teams are taking a spectrophotometric approach using varying approaches in micro-fluidics and lab-on-a-chip designs, Team OSU-FABE Sastry Lab from Ohio utilized novel nanomaterials based their design on pH sensors used in food science, and a team of students from Duke University (Team Blue Devil Engineering) modified a technique used to measure pH in agriculture.All of this innovation is happening under the careful observation of our scientific advisory team, led by Dick Feely and Chris Sabine from NOAA's Seattle-based Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. Dick and Chris wrote landmark publications that advanced the world's understanding of ocean acidification. They contributed to early Visioneering of the prize concept and have been part of a key team of advisors through the ideation and design processes. They inspire us with their patience. It cannot be easy to advocate for better stewardship of our oceans with full knowledge of the urgency. We are positively humbled when they say to us that what we are doing is important.Best of all, Nicole Killebrew, a longstanding interpreter with our educational partner, the Seattle Aquarium, shared a story from their first day of tours: Upon viewing a tank filled with the active sensors, a 5-year-old girl asked \"Is this real science?\" Upon receiving affirmation she declared, \"Science is Awesome.\"One of our sayings at XPRIZE is \"the impact of a prize begins the day after a prize is won.\" It's our teams and the amazing innovations they produce that truly change the world. We also realize we may not know the full impact of our competition for a long time to come. These things are all true. In success, this competition triggers an exponential series of positive impacts, starting with better science and stories and hopefully resulting in better solutions and advocacy. And I can truly say that what I saw in Seattle is enough to make me want to throw Skittles (the in-game snack of famed Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch). We were in the home of the Seahawks, after all.Visit XPRIZE at xprize.org, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+, and get our Newsletter to stay informed."}, {"title": "A Resettlement Injustice in the Making", "text": "There is an old expression that says you cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. This basic logic sums up the international development approach of the World Bank: in order to make a project come to fruition, there will be consequences. Build a dam and you will flood large areas of land. Build a power plant and you will undoubtedly be adding to air pollution. The examples go on and on. One such consequence, however, has the most direct and long-lasting impact on local populations. Resettlement, both involuntary and voluntary, involves human beings with rights -- NOT eggs.The World Bank seems eager to provide financial support, in a form of Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG), to the Kosovar government for construction of a new coal-based power plant. To date, much of the criticism surrounding the plant has focused on the use of carbon-heavy and environmentally destructive coal as a power source and the tremendous amount of energy/electricity Kosovo loses through its outdated, antiquated power grid and transmission and delivery lines. These are all valid points. But what about the people who are in the path of the expanded power plant and coal mine? Kosovo and the World Bank are trying to avoid responsibility for the impoverishment and suffering that will surely come on the heels of the involuntary resettlement of over 7,000 Kosovars from their homes and communities.Photo caption: Houses destroyed to make way for the expansion of the coal mine in Hade village, in Kosovo (Photo credit: Dren Pozhegu)A recent report - commissioned by the Kosovo Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development (KOSID) and authored by the International Network on Displacement and Resettlement (INDR) president Dr. Ted Downing - concludes that although millions of World Bank development dollars have been spent on the ground on \"technical assistance,\" the resettlement plan fails to comply with basic international involuntary resettlement standards. These are the standards that must be met for any project to obtain international financing through the World Bank. Put another way, the Bank is not playing by its own rules. Clearly this does not bode well for Kosovo and the indigenous populations worldwide that may be next in line to be ignored and glossed over on the Bank's whim.There are several specific areas where the Bank falls well short of proper involuntary resettlement standards and norms. Downing's report lays out six. These include: wildly overestimating the capacity and capabilities of the government of Kosovo; drastically underestimating the costs of mass resettlement - and thereby overestimating the overall profitability of the new coal plant project; and perhaps most alarming of all, electric rate-payers will be left holding the tab for all cost overruns, not the government, World Bank, or private sector investors. It is safe to assume both that there will be cost overruns and that they will pit the displaced against the basic rate-payer. As a result, the costs of resettlement that the government did not anticipate will come out of the rate-payers' pockets. This is a recipe for internal disorder and strife in a young nation that may not be able to deal with it. To add insult to injury, there are no jobs waiting for the displaced where they are to be relocated. With their homes and communities to be lost to a power plant, they must suffer the double indignity of having their livelihoods lost as well.Photo caption: Excavator mining in the Sibovc open-pit mine in Kosovo (Photo credit: Dren Pozhegu)The World Bank has standards and safeguards that it is obliged to enforce and live up to itself. They are designed to prevent this very scenario: Bank client nations undermining their own citizens, environment, and/or laws to get funding that they are not rightly entitled to. And these very same safeguards are going through a multi-year refinement and improvement process right now. Opt-out clauses - like the one the Bank itself is pushing in Kosovo - are designed to legally avoid compliance with the Bank policies. These should be removed across the board. Not just on resettlement issues but environment, gender, climate, etc. Laws never work as desired if they are - for all intents and purposes - optional.So what can be done about this resettlement plan and the over 7,000 Kosovars set to be removed from their homes? Is there a way the global community can resist this World Bank overreach or is it on autopilot? Let's state some basic undeniable facts: Kosovo needs more power; Kosovo and the Bank need to invest in clean energy, not the dirty carbon-intense fuels of the past; and neither Kosovo nor the Bank should be skirting international norms to get a deal done quickly rather than correctly. With that in mind, the clear answer seems to be to get to work on a plan that will provide power and electricity nationwide without the use of coal or any other fossil fuels. Involuntary resettlement is just the most serious evil currently at play in this project. The Kosovo Power Project is rife with problems and outrages and it is only getting worse. There is no reason this can't end well for everyone involved. Unless attention is paid to fully restoring the lives and livelihoods of those in the way, the Bank and Kosovo government itself are planting the seeds of future civil strife in one of Europe's fledgling democracies."}, {"title": "Sweet 16", "text": "More proof that good things are worth waiting for. About a year and a half ago, my family and I hiked in Colorado's Browns Canyon, along with some military veterans, Sierra Club volunteers, and local rafting owners. At the time, local people had been trying for two decades to get permanent protection for the canyon (which has long been popular with whitewater rafters and other outdoor enthusiasts). As is often the case, they'd come tantalizingly close to succeeding more than once. Fortunately, they never gave up.Yesterday that dedication finally paid off when President Obama designated about 21,000 acres in Browns Canyon as one of our three newest national monuments. The other two new monuments are important historic sites: Pullman National Monument in Chicago, and Honouliuli National Monument in Hawaii.That makes a total of 16 national monuments from President Obama, who has used the Antiquities Act exactly as intended: to protect places of national importance that, if lost, could never be replaced. But although the president makes the designations, it also takes a lot of grassroots support and hard work locally to make them happen.The important thing is that these newest monuments did happen, and they belong to all of us.Why not take a moment to tell President Obama thanks?"}, {"title": "Breaking Bad Habits: How Vietnam War Veterans Broke Their Heroin Addictions", "text": "It was 1971 and the Vietnam War was heading into its 16th year when two congressmen, Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois, made a discovery that stunned the American public.While visiting the troops in Vietnam, the two congressmen discovered that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers had developed an addiction to heroin. (Later research, which tested every American soldier in Vietnam for heroin addiction, would reveal that 40 percent of servicemen had tried heroin and nearly 20 percent were addicted.) The discovery shocked the American public and led to a flurry of activity in Washington, which included President Richard Nixon announcing the creation of a new office called The Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention.The office was created to promote prevention and rehabilitation of drug addictions and also to track and research the paths of addicted servicemen and women when they returned home. It was this last part, the tracking of returning soldiers, that led to some surprising insights.Lee Robins, one of the researchers in charge of tracking the veterans, found that when the soldiers returned to the United States only 5 percent of them became re-addicted to heroin. In other words, 95 percent eliminated their addiction nearly overnight. [1]This finding completely contradicted the patterns of normal addiction. The typical heroin cycle went something like this: an addicted user would enter a clinic and get clean, but once they returned home, the re-addiction rate was 90 percent or higher. Nearly every heroin addict relapsed. The Vietnam soldiers were displaying a pattern that was exactly the opposite.What was going on here? And, perhaps more important, what can it teach us about changing our own behaviors, building better habits, and breaking bad ones?How Addictions Get ShapedHere is what happened in Vietnam: Soldiers spent all day surrounded by a certain environment. They were inundated with the stress of war. They built friendships with fellow soldiers who were heroin users. The end result was that soldiers were surrounded by an environment that had multiple stimuli driving them toward heroin use. It's not hard to imagine how living in a war zone with other heroin users could drive you to try it yourself.Once each soldier returned to the United States, however, they found themselves in a completely different environment. Not only that, they found themselves in an environment devoid of the stimuli that triggered their heroin use in the first place. Without the stress, the fellow heroin users, and the environmental factors to trigger their addiction, many soldiers found it easier to quit.Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. The individual picks up a bad habit at home, goes to a clinic to get clean (e.g., somewhere devoid of all the external stimuli that drive their habit), then return to their old environment with all of their old triggers surrounding them, and somehow hope to quit their bad habit. It's no wonder 90 percent of typical heroin users became re-addicted once they return home -- they are surrounded by all of the things that caused them to get addicted in the first place.Similar situations drive bad habits for all of us, from nail biting to smoking to drug use. Of course, none of this is to say that the change in drug use was purely due to environment changes. (It is likely there were a variety of factors at play. [2: There is an additional caveat to the Vietnam study that I believe is worth mentioning. The percentage of soldiers who remained addicted after returning to the U.S. was very similar to the percentage of addicts we typically find in society. I'm not an expert on addiction and can't say what the answer is, but it's obvious that environment change is not a magic cure to all addiction problems. It is best to view this simply as another tool in your tool belt that you can use to build new habits and break old ones. As always, the only truth for you as an individual will be what works for your life, so embrace an attitude of self-experimentation and try things out to see what works for you.]) But the central idea is a solid one: The stimuli that surround you shape your behaviors day after day, often without you realizing it. Environment drives behavior.To Change Your Behavior, Change Your EnvironmentThe impact that external stimuli can have on behavior is well-known. I have written previously about choice architecture and how it can be used to drive better health habits.These effects go beyond the physical environment. Your friendships matter too. One popular study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, tracked 12,067 people for 32 years and found that \"a person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.\" [3] The people we connect with and the places we live in often determine our behavior and habits as much as we do ourselves.The good news is that, at least to a certain degree, your environment is within your control. If you want to change your behavior, then change your environment. Even small adjustments can make a difference. One of the simplest ways to do this is to \"design for laziness\" and make default options healthier or more productive, which is a strategy I covered in detail here.Here are some other examples to get your creative juices flowing:Trying to build an exercise habit? Rather than going home after work, stop by a new place like a park or a hiking trail (or a gym, if that's your thing), and let the new environment be a blank slate for your new behavior rather than trying to force yourself to overcome all of the old triggers at your home.Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room or surround yourself with expansive architecture away from the normal space that drives most of your thought patterns. (More on the link between architecture and behavior here.)Hoping to buy healthier food? It is likely that you have some autopilot shopping habits right now. Try going to a new grocery store and developing a different routine of selecting food. You may find it much easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn't automatically know where it is located. (You can even use my outer ring strategy to avoid most of the processed food.)By simply removing yourself from an environment that triggers all of your old habits, you can make it easier to break bad habits and build new ones.James Clear writes at JamesClear.com, where he shares science-based ideas for living a better life and building habits that stick.

That is, if she ever makes it to the trailhead. This week, President Obama unveiled the \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative to connect children and their families with the great outdoors, ensuring millions of kids, regardless of where they live, have an opportunity to take that first step in nature. The initiative will provide free entrance to our nation's treasured public lands for every fourth grader in America -- oh, and they can take their families, too.This initiative matters, because not every kid has a forest in her backyard. In fact, most don't. More than 80 percent of America now lives in urban areas and this number grows every year. Opportunities to enjoy and explore nearby nature are limited for many children. Fewer than half of all kids in the United States can safely walk to a park from their home, and school testing priorities and funding cuts are reducing opportunities for physical education, recess and field trips. Fears about playing outdoors affect how children spend their free time. And today's youth are able to keep themselves contented indoors with television, video games and computers; they're clocking about 53 hours of screen time each week. The barriers to spending time in nature are high, and they're even higher for low-income communities.President Obama understands that not all kids have the same opportunities to connect with nature. Whether or not a child will climb a tree, run through a forest, roll down a hill, or splash in a creek depends a lot on where she grows up and the values and interests of her parents, teachers and other adult figures in her life. Last October, Obama knocked down one roadblock to getting outside by increasing close-to-home access to the outdoors, or nearby nature, for nearly 15 million people living in Los Angeles County. When the President established the San Gabriel Mountains as a National Monument, he said \"too many children in L.A. County, especially children of color, don't have access to parks where they can run free and breathe fresh air, experience nature, and learn about their own environment.\" With the San Gabriel designation, Obama protected 346,177 acres, providing improved outdoor recreation opportunities for millions of kids and families.President Obama's \"Every Kid in a Park\" is the latest in a series of barrier busting moves he's making to increase access to nature for all. The initiative will provide fourth graders across the nation an opportunity to visit America's great outdoors free of charge. To support \"Every Kid in a Park,\" the National Park Foundation will expand its Ticket to Ride program to award transportation grants to schools in need. The initiative builds on the US Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell's youth initiative to get children and youth playing, learning, serving and working outdoors. And it will kick off at the beginning of the 2015 school year, just in time to start celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. As we gear up for the centennial in 2016, \"Every Kid in a Park\" challenges us to think about the next 100 years. What will the future of our outdoor legacy look like if we don't make sure all kids have a chance to experience it?Sierra Club shares the President's vision. Whether it's a National Park or a neighborhood park, we'll do our part to ensure the next generation has opportunities to experience nature. Sierra Club's Nearby Nature initiative supports community-driven conservation efforts, like parks, gardens and trails, to help ensure that close-to-home access to the outdoors becomes a reality for kids and families across the socioeconomic spectrum. Our Inspiring Connections Outdoors program has been training and supporting volunteer mentors who empower kids to get outdoors for over 40 years and now reaches 15,000 youth each year with nature-based outings in our local and National Parks and everything in between. And the Outdoors Alliance for Kids, a diverse coalition of over 75 businesses and non-profits co-founded by Sierra Club, supports and will continue to advocate for efforts like the President's \"Every Kid in a Park\" initiative, that provide quality opportunities for our children to get outdoors."}, {"title": "North Carolina's Brevard College First in the Southeast to Divest", "text": "College students, faculty, and administrators at North Carolina's Brevard College are cheering at Friday's news that the school will divest from fossil fuels by 2018 -- making it the first university in North Carolina and the entire Southeast U.S. to divest!The school has a robust group of student organizers (Divest Brevard and the Brevard College Greens) who've been rallying, speaking, and working hard toward this goal since 2013.\"Divestment is important to our students because Brevard College is a place that, to quote from the mission statement, '(i)nspires social action,'\" says Brevard student and Co-President of Brevard College Greens Emily Crowley. \"As students we feel it is important to embrace the inspiration Brevard has given us to ignite a movement that is important to all facets of the world.\"The students worked closely with Jim Reynolds of the Sierra Club North Carolina's Pisgah Group -- who is also a professor at Brevard.

You place a bet that you sometimes do not even fully articulate to yourself. When Dale Sims and I started our company, CleanFish, we believed that people would increasingly care about the sources of their food. We sensed that better seafood producers were out there and that by promoting only select ecologically responsible products we could establish a new kind of market platform, one that would be part of sparking a return to healthier land-and-ocean ecosystem solutions. All the work we put toward our company was based on this simple belief that people did care about being more connected to the sources of all food, including our seafood.The fish and seafood business is tough. The practices and the general attitudes of many in our commercial seafood sector make it tougher than it needs to be. The U.S. market has multiple levels of disconnection between those producing most seafood and those consuming seafood products. This disconnection favors the seller over the buyer of most seafood products, this is not unique to seafood. Indeed, most of us have very little sense of what we are really buying as we check out of supermarkets and restaurants throughout this nation.This past week the nation celebrated the life and the lessons of two specific presidents, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln; respectively the first and the sixteenth President of the United States of America.It is interesting that Lincoln is reconfigured by many historians as another a Founding Father, as it was the task of Lincoln to guide this nation through the rough waters of the Civil War and set down in word and law a next wave of responses to challenges of freedom in his time. Lincoln's words reach out to touch us still as he engaged the challenges of his time as intensely connected and personal. He, therefore, made his inner struggles and his insights regarding our freedoms, lasting ones that many still hold dear.Lincoln stated the issues of his time in this manner: \"the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country...It is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says-- you toil and work, and earn bread; and I'll eat it. No matter in what shape it comes; whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor; or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.\"Lincoln called on the people of our nation to think hard on the meaning of those who died in battle. The Civil War touched the lives of most every family of that time. Subsequent wars by this nation up to and including Vietnam were efforts that touched the lives of each community in the land. The sense of honoring that loss was a major connecting element throughout this nation.This is not true today. In this season, we too often watch TV, or go to movies to become aware of the enormous personal price being paid by others. A mere 1% of our citizenry carries out our soldiering. The volunteer army has many consequences. The most profound, perhaps, is that it permits the visceral disconnection of most of our citizenry from the blood and treasure costs of war. Not so long ago we had a summer of \"Occupy\". The rallying cry was a calling out of Wall Street and the banking industry's executive criminals who stole money from each and every community in this nation. Again seeking to make awareness of that loss a point of connection the call went out: \"We are the 99%\". That calling out was intended to wake up the nation to the fact that access to wealth was becoming increasingly disconnected from the people of the nation.There are a string of disconnections that we would do well to awaken from.\"We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country\", said Lincoln. We must wake up from a period in which the trend to accept disconnection and the inequality that is its consequence becomes a given.This Great Disconnection as I shall call it, is robbing us of our pursuit of happiness, of our health, of that sense of common-wealth that has been our strength in times past. This characteristic of people benefiting from elements of finance, of defense, of food convenience to the detriment of their true wealth, freedom, and nutritional health is all part of this Great Disconnection.Next, there is, also, that hard-working 1% of us producing food for the 99% of us who are eating. This is a consequence of trading connection for convenience and it is a costly and traumatic disconnect. This aspect of the Great Disconnection is allowed to discontinue the value and the knowledge any people who want to survive must have about our food. As this knowledge dramatically drifts away from us there is a great loss, as part of the essential ground of interdependence of all things is as if taken away. This is a disconnection of connections of people, by people and for people that deals with how we feed ourselves and nurture our communities.\"We must disenthrall ourselves and then we can save our country\", said Abe Lincoln of those elements that allow and extend the emptiness of this disconnection if we are to revitalize and make certain that \"this nation of the people, for the people, and by the people...does not perish from (what we know see as an increasingly depleted) earth.\"As his version of calling out an inconvenient truth about rights and freedoms, Lincoln stated, \"we cannot escape history.\" The call that many sense today is to revitalize and redeem our political system, our social systems, and our food market system. We all benefit when we honor our desire to know where our food comes from. We delight in our fish that much more when we know how it comes to us. Today as we, each one of us, wake up from this Great Disconnection, \"we must think anew and act anew.\"Learn about the natural cycle of foods upon which you, and all of us depend; and, then, act to express your freedom of choice: vote with your fork."}, {"title": "Fighting Fast Track: Is It Really China or Us?", "text": "Is it really China or us?If we don't set the rules, China will, President Obama warned in his State of the Union Address, which was otherwise mostly a welcome call to action against economic inequality. President Obama stressed that Trade Promotion Authority, or Fast Track, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) were about China or us. This week U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman flew to Dallas to attend a constituent meeting with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and said the same thing.But is this an economic argument or an argument from the National Security Council and the State Department? Are U.S. working women and men again being called out to sacrifice, despite 30 years of no wage increases and millions of lost jobs, our cities hollowed out by the flight of once-good-paying manufacturing jobs to countries with pay that's 90 percent lower, no rights for workers or environmental regulation? Or do the president and the USTR really believe they are making an economic argument -- that U.S. workers will be better served competing with Vietnam's 75-cents-an-hour average pay?If it really is China or us, why don't we address currency manipulation and prevent Japan and other TPP nations from following China's example of controlling exchange rates so that our exports can't compete?And if it is really China or us, why does the USTR insist on guaranteeing multinational corporations profits when they invest abroad? Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei are certainly not interested in one-way lawsuits by multibillion-dollar corporations if they enact any legislation that threatens those corporate profits! Investor-State Dispute Settlement cases from old free trade agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA have already forced mostly poorer nations to pay tens of millions of dollars in settlements and arbitration awards, and 500 cases are pending now.In fact, our trade framework is an unholy alliance between the geopolitical concerns of the State Department and the business interests of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable. U.S. workers and those who care about the environment, global health care, human rights, consumer safety, balanced trade and manufacturing renewal are left out. We've heard nearly identical promises from Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama regarding previous deals with China, Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and Korea.Those deals and others like them have led to the U.S. accumulating more than $10 trillion in trade deficits over the past 20 years, far more than the rest of the world combined. Those deals have emptied small and large cities from Trenton to St. Louis of millions of jobs that would have provided a decent income to urban America. Instead our cities are burned out and in the case of Detroit and others, bankrupt.At the Dallas meeting, Froman said that the labor and environmental chapters of the TPP were a big improvement for American workers and environmentalists. That is true for those who compare the text to older agreements. But the enforcement of these chapters is exactly the same. It's the same story as I saw firsthand in Honduras, where our joint complaint was filed three years ago or Guatemala where Froman finally intervened six years after similar complaints about the destruction of human rights, failure to pay even the pitiful minimum wage or enforce any labor regulations.In fact, enforcement of virtually all of the TPP, except for the secret arbitration of profit obstacles for foreign corporations, is done by the USTR. In addition to the differences in speed, for citizen complaints there are no reparations, and there has never been any meaningful enforcement for U.S. workers or environmentalists in 20 years of these trade deals aside from some litigation against China for unfair competition and with little result.Next week Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will likely drop the same old Fast Track that we have seen the past 21 years. Fast Track guarantees a quick vote with little debate and no amendments in the House and Senate for the TPP and likely any other trade deal for years to come -- well into the next president's term of office. Hopefully some senators will stand up and shout about it, but likely Fast Track gets rammed through that body. The fight is in the House where 80 percent or more of Democrats are likely to vote \"no,\" and right now they're joined by enough Republicans to stop it. But Boehner Trade will only be stopped for sure if millions of Americans stand up and shout \"NO.\" We are mobilizing like never before to say we have had enough. The coalition against Fast Track is massive.We say to our president and his allies on the TPP, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), that no other government has Fast Track. This is not what democracy looks like -- secret trade deals rammed through in record time that guarantee fat corporate profits, but likely result in net job loss and wage competition that leads to pay stagnation in the U.S. for years to come. We have had enough of corporate lawsuits against nations that attempt to stop the destruction of their environment or promote public safety.This time talk about American workers once again competing and winning in the world economy with their hands tied behind their backs, while stock prices zoom and CEO pay rises will not confuse us.

Communities are flexing their muscles and taking control of their drinking water supplies -- instead of just letting outside interests call the shots on how to manage local water resources.Last week, I joined grassroots advocates, local officials in suburban Rockland County and the Chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission for a truly groundbreaking planning event. Our goal: create a comprehensive strategy for sustainable water supplies, better flood control and greater protection for aquatic flora and fauna, in the wake of the PSC's ruling last November rejecting a wasteful plan to desalinate the Hudson to create a new drinking water supply that Rockland simply doesn't need.State PSC Chairwoman Audrey Zibelman couldn't stop praising the community activists, government officials, business representatives and water utility officials involved in this unique from-the-ground-up planning process. In fact, she called it a campaign for sustainability that the whole state might one day be able to learn from.The morning after this great meeting in Rockland, I learned of another huge win for smart, community-driven water management planning, just a little farther up the Hudson.Victory number two was in Ulster County, near Woodstock, where the Niagara Bottling company decided to drop plans to build the region's first major water bottling plant, rather than go through an in-depth environmental impact review process, which skeptical local water advocates fought for and won earlier this year.Inspired by Rockland's example and their own success in forcing Niagara to defend their project or just go home, Ulster County's grassroots water protectors have started their own planning initiative, holding a \"Watershed Task Force\" organizing meeting the very same night that State PSC Chairwoman Zibelman was with Rockland's water management planners.Looking at the defeat of desalination in Rockland and the abandonment of plans to sell bottled water from Ulster, as well as the two community-based planning initiatives arising from the ashes of these failed projects, it's clear that something extraordinary is taking shape, here along the Hudson:The work ahead for Rockland's and Ulster's \"smart-tap\" planning coalitions won't be easy. Even in the relatively water-rich Hudson Valley, our H2O supplies face progressively increasing stress from climate change and companies hankering to slake thirsts in drier regions by getting hold of our own \"excess\" water supplies. Communities will need help to get these initiatives right -- they're simply bigger than what dedicated volunteer advocates and local nonprofits can manage on their own.But the first shots in the battle to protect our water supplies have already been fired and their aim was true. In turning back powerful and well-funded interests seeking to desalinate the Hudson River and export water from our lakes and streams, these grassroots water patriots are revolutionizing water resource planning here in New York. By doing so, they just might have provided us with a roadmap for success in many of the other big sustainability battles that lie ahead."}, {"title": "Environmental Collapse and Extinction: The Bright Side", "text": "It has always seemed painfully clear, that the human race was on a collision course: incessant war, casual destruction of natural habitats for quick profits, unbridled expansion, overconsumption; an indifferent, rapacious creature, believing itself to be above and outside of nature -- special, superior, made in the image and likeness of the creator -- never yielding its assumed right of way, entitled to do and have whatever it desires, without consequence. And now, never having paused or skipped a beat, standing, face to face with a global, environmental meltdown and mass extinction produced, directed by and starring... us. Surprise? Hardly. Seems like the inevitable, sadly predictable conclusion.Well, let's not be hasty with judgement. Perhaps, there is a bright side, to this grim, rapidly approaching, end of story. Maybe, we only think that we have the power to act, to be agents with free will and the ability to cause change.What if, it all has been predetermined, ordained? What if, in fact, we are included in a dynamic continuum of universal process, in an infinite, unbroken web of evolving life and consciousness? Not separate and detached, not the prime mover, as we have led ourselves to believe. If that is the case, then what is happening to earth's environment now, cannot be simply attributed to us. Rather, it can only be viewed as an evolutionary event, in the broadest sense. An instance of universal unfolding towards balance; perhaps, in a wider perspective than we can grasp with our limited, human awareness. What appears to be destructive, destabilizing behavior, may be nothing more than an evolutionary adjustment, moving a developing, larval species towards equanimity and harmony in a far wider context.Confusion may be a simple matter of the relativity of perspective. From the up-close, myopic perception of contemporary man, human activity may appear destructive, careless, arrogant ... even insane. Let's face it; what kind of organism willfully and deliberately persists in destroying the host environment on which its very own existence and survival depend? How evolved, superior and special is that?But, let's back up a bit and view this self-generated, extinction scenario from a distance. Maybe we are special ... in that an impersonal universal force has selected an evolving species (us) to unwittingly engineer the adverse environmental conditions necessary to drive a radical, adaptive response from the entire spectrum of life inhabiting earth. Picture it as a sort of turbo charged, evolutionary twitch.Think of it. Humanity, propelled by universal impulse (some might say, \"grand\" or \"divine\" plan), sets up and stokes a planetary extinction machine whose momentum builds to a level that decimates all life on earth. Well, it's never all. Some vestiges and remnants survive, having had the odd, anomalous gene that allows mutation, adaptation and survival. The seminal beginnings of a new earth. Not the end, but, rather, metamorphosis, transformation and emergence of a new, more evolved cycle of life. A new world order.Let's take this notion one step further. MARS! That's right, other worlds! The scientific/technical community is currently spending billions in preparation for a human settlement on Mars. Perhaps, our destiny to erase life, in preparation for a next cycle extends beyond planet earth. We may ultimately be the cosmic broom, sweeping away the old and preparing for the new, throughout the entire solar system ... the galaxy!CNN headline on February 11, 2015: \"Mars is the next step for humanity -- we must take it\"(CNN) - Elon Musk has built a $12 billion company in an endeavor to pave the way to Mars for humanity. He insists that Mars is a \"long-term insurance policy\" for \"the light of consciousness\" in the face of climate change, extinction events, and our recklessness with technology.So, lighten up! Rather than indulge in depression and guilt, over the fact that humanity, has, as a side effect, to its rapid bloom on this world, managed to sweep a flourishing, vibrant carpet of life to the gate of extinction; revel with pride and satisfaction in the notion that we may be wiping the slate clean in preparation for a new cycle of life: stronger, purified, cleansed and even more special.Even now, on the very eve of extinction, we continue to move forward with strength, courage and determination to complete the task of annihilation with the almost certain knowledge that our own demise is part of the package. Perhaps, in some distant and hazy future, archaeologists will discover a thin, toxic layer in the geological record of planet earth and reverently intone, \"this is what remains of original human civilization... that legendary and special race of beings, avatars of change, martyrs, who sacrificed so many of themselves so that we could be here\".The themes of environmental collapse, extinction and human evolution are developed more fully in Joseph Carlisi's book, Playing God on the Eve of Extinction, which is available from Amazon."}, {"title": "Watch 77 People Surf The Same River Wave In France", "text": "They say there's a unique wave for every surfer, but this swell might be suitable for everybody.In the video above, approximately 77 people surfed the same wave as it shot up the Dordogne River in southwestern France, according to a count by Surfer Mag.Jean-Marc Chauvet posted the clip to his Vimeo account about five months ago with the caption, in French, \"Some pictures of [a tidal bore] in Saint Pardon on the Dordogne.\"The video went viral this week when the Surf Federation of Costa Rica posted the video to its Facebook page, describing it as the \"best day in friendship\" but mistakenly identifying the wave as the pororoca, a tidal bore on the Amazon River.Tidal bores are seemingly endless waves that occur at the mouth of a river when a full or new moon brings the rising tide in so strongly that it flushes the river with water. This generates waves that travel upstream, temporarily reversing the river's course.It is literally a tidal wave.Tidal bores can be dangerous, as National Geographic explains:A tidal bore can be quite violent. The bore often changes the color of the river from blue or green to brown as it whips up sediment. Tidal bores can tear vegetation like trees from their roots. This makes the recreation sports of river surfing and kayaking very dangerous. Surfers from China to Alaska have been pulled into the river, bay or ocean. Even watching a bore can be dangerous: Tidal waves have been known to sweep over lookout points and drag people to the churning river.Dozens of people have been killed watching the impressive tidal bore in China's Qiantang River over the years, swept away or otherwise fatally injured when the river has surged over sea walls.In some locations, crocodiles, piranhas, bears, eagles and other carnivores wade in the bore's aftermath to scavenge for fish and birds left dazed or dead on the river banks.Dangers aside, tidal bores are attractive to surfers because they create 10-to-13-foot waves that travel as fast as 15 m.p.h. Surfers can ride them for 20 minutes or more.Windsurfer Robby Naish rode the pororoca bore in the Amazon river 1,476 feet from bank to bank, setting the Guinness World Record for the widest ride of a river tidal bore.Other famous bores include Alaska's Turnagain Arm, China's Qiantang, and others in France, where they're called mescarets."}, {"title": "These Red Pandas From The Cincinnati Zoo Are SO Excited About The Snow", "text": "These red pandas sure know how to make the most of the recent Arctic blast.Lissa Browning, a zookeeper at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, captured a video of two red pandas frolicking in the snow after a recent snowfall in Ohio, according to ABC News.

In 2009, after three combat tours in Iraq, Brandon had earned a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars with Valor Device, and was finally returning home. He was decorated and distinguished, but in his own words \"washed up\" as he was learning to survive with PTSD and the after-effects of war. He was not alone. Since 2001, more than two million troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Over half are married and 40% have at least two children. More than a quarter have self-reported depression, compounding the emotional and financial stress on their families.The path forward for returning veterans can be bolstered by treatment, therapy, and medication; but is also too often marked by addiction and suicide. Ultimately, Brandon would find his footing in the same place that his relentless sense of adventure took him as a boy growing up outside Cleveland - the outdoors. \"Recreation in nature has had a major impact on myself and on military families and my friends. You go out and you're refreshed. Your senses are cleaned. Your short-term memory resets; you don't remember emails and annoyances. You remember nature; you're in the now. You're in the present.\"After summiting Mt. Rainier on an outing with several other veterans, Brandon became addicted to climbing, hooked on aspects that are remarkably similar to those he encountered during combat - camaraderie, adventure, and a dose of adrenaline. Mountaineering is an experience he has since shared with hundreds of other veterans, first as the Military Organizer for the Sierra Club Mission Outdoors Program and now as a leader at a program called Project Rebirth.Brandon is mindful that outdoor recreation alone is not a substitute for professional treatment, but he is also clear that deep in the backcountry, men and women returning from war are discovering a sense of peace - and empowerment. And for those not ready to take on alpine adventures, nature is also waiting closer to home. Over the last two years, veterans and their families from across the country have come to IslandWood, an outdoor learning center that we direct near Seattle. They visit us to participate in Operation Purple Family Retreats offered by the National Military Family Association (NMFA).From our field experience, we have known for a long time that outdoor learning programs are a tipping point for children - a springboard to a lifelong love of discovery and commitment to stewardship. Now we are seeing a similar impact on veterans and their families, as do with the kids we serve. And the evidence is not just anecdotal: a 2013 report prepared by the University of Michigan found that veterans who participated in outdoor recreation activities - especially those that involved physical challenge, camaraderie, and achievement - were more likely to report improvements in psychological well being, social functioning, and outlook on life. This is particularly encouraging news for those veterans who feel more comfortable seeking help outdoors than in traditional counseling settings.At a time when many trends with returning warriors are going the wrong way - alarming rates of depression and suicide, skyrocketing healthcare costs - the idea that an affordable treatment may be instantly available without prescription, side effect, or stigma sounds almost too good to be true.But it was true for Joshua Brandon. And it is true for thousands of other veterans who are finding solace, hope, peace, and new direction in the outdoors. These nature-based experiences are saving lives. And, Brandon believes they are also helping to save nature itself. \"When veterans find the outdoors, they make it their own. They become accidental conservationists who come to see environmental concerns as a national security issue and not just a liberal issue.\" Time in nature has the power to transform lives, and in many cases to save lives too.This blog was coauthored by Martin LeBlanc.Need help?

Real Girls Don't Abuse Female Animals", "text": "If you missed the Super Bowl commercial that reframes the idea of doing something \"like a girl\" as a compliment (as it should be), I can't recommend it highly enough. But one pork industry spokesperson was also moved by the commercial -- moved to attempt to co-opt the hashtag by blogging about it on Pork Network in reference to what it means to \"Farm #LikeAGirl.\"There's a major problem with this PR ploy though: In the pork industry and in much of animal agriculture, it's actually the female animals who are the most abused.Case in point: Pork Network supports the standard pork industry practice of locking a female pig inside a tiny cage, forcing a human arm deep inside of her to artificially inseminate her and then leaving her to languish immobilized for the entirety of her four-month pregnancy. When she finally gives birth, she's moved to another crate where she'll also be so confined she can't even turn around and is separated from her babies. She'll push her body against the bars that confine her while her babies scream as their tails are cut off without painkiller. And after just a few weeks, those babies will be torn from her prematurely so she can be impregnated to start the cycle all over again. And again. And again.The pork industry's sordid track record of systematically tormenting female pigs is matched by the egg industry's rampant cruelty toward hens. Nearly all female chickens used for egg production are locked in cages so small they can't even spread their wings. For more than a year, these hens suffer in squalid, cramped conditions.And the dairy industry's abuse of female cows is also notorious. Like mother pigs used on breeding factories, dairy cows are essentially kept in a perpetual state of artificially-induced pregnancy, since of course only female mammals produce milk. Not only do we take the milk intended for their babies, but those babies are stolen from their mothers on the very first day of life, a traumatic experience for mother and baby alike.Even in farmed animal experimentation, this trend of female exploitation seems to continue. A recent New York Times exposé of a federally-funded meat industry research facility revealed that in order to study libido in cattle, the experimenters locked a cow's head in a cage so she couldn't escape and then put six bulls in with her. The researchers allowed the bulls to rape the immobile cow for hours, until \"her back legs were broken. Her body was just torn up.\" She died later that day from the assault.The point isn't to suggest that male animals don't suffer in the meat, egg and dairy industries. They do -- terribly. The point is, though, that often the most insidious abuses in the animal agribusiness world are reserved for female animals. It's almost as if the industry somehow feels even more comfortable inflicting horrific cruelty when the animal victims are female.If we really want to do something \"like a girl,\" we shouldn't be talking about farming animals like a girl. Rather, we should be protecting animals like a girl. That's to say we should be giving female animals -- and all abused animals -- a strong, powerful voice. And that voice should be saying that it's time we treat all farmed animals not as mere commodities, but as individuals who deserve our respect.

There May Soon Be An App For That", "text": "Ever wish you could swing by the local shelter and take a dog out for a walk?There might soon be an easy way to book that. A San Francisco-area couple is developing an app to help match up shelter dogs with canine lovers who want to take them out for a stroll.Walkzee was inspired by a program that Charlie Saunders and his wife Cristina enjoyed -- a lot -- while on a Hawaiian honeymoon. They took out a doggie named Big Z from the Kauai Humane Society, which encourages visitors to borrow shelter dogs for day trips like hiking or the beach.Such outings are great for the dogs, who get more relaxed and well-socialized. Wearing cute little \"adopt me\" vests, they also get exposed to lots of new potential adopters.The humans obviously love it, too. \"It really was the best thing we did on our honeymoon,\" Saunders says.\"While on the walk we talked about how amazing it was as a program,\" he told The Huffington Post. \"So many dog lovers don't have a dog to spend time with, because of their job or home situation. Meanwhile, so many dogs wait for a walk in a shelter. We think this is crazy.\"The pair wanted to see if they couldn't get more shelter dogs out walking with more dog lovers -- leading, in turn, to more adoptions.The couple had a great time with Big Z, and wanted to make it so other dog lovers -- and other shelter dogs -- could also get out walking. (photo courtesy Walkzee)Here's how the app would work: Shelters could list their dogs on Walkzee, then would-be walkers would search for those dogs by location. They'd request a walk using the shelter's preferred method, which could be through the app, by reaching out to the shelter directly, or in any other way the shelter likes to field requests.Afterward, walkers could leave Yelp-like reviews for both dogs and shelters. They'd also be able donate directly to the shelters through the app. Walkzee won't take a cut, Saunders says; the app, which will be free, will likely rely on advertising to make money.Users could also share their experiences on Facebook and other social media platforms, giving the dogs more exposure.And after that, if things go very well? \"You can also send an adoption request to the shelter and kick off the adoption process,\" says Saunders.The hope is that Walkzee will launch in June. Saunders and his wife are currently holding a Kickstarter campaign, which is about two-thirds of the way toward its $20,000 goal. Saunders says there are other funding avenues available, should crowdfunding not come through.  There are still a few other initial steps left to complete before the first version of the app is actually ready for use, like getting actual shelters on board. Saunders says he's already heard from a handful of organizations who are ready to sign on, and he's confident that there will be plenty more pickings by launch time.He has reason to be optimistic. For one thing, more and more shelters are already offering Kauai-like walking opportunities. They're available now at shelters in Northern Virginia, Austin, Atlanta and Utah, to name a few places.For another, there are designs on enticing more shelters into joining by offering up bonuses like dog-supply packages -- with leashes, blankets, etc. -- for participants.Future app features may include some sort of background check process for walkers, Saunders says, and perhaps a version of Walkzee for people who like cats. (May we suggest \"Meowzee?\")Itching to take a shelter dog for a walk? Don't go looking for Big Z, the inspiration for all these plans.

Hatfield's Legacy to Three Friends", "text": "Excerpt from Inside Out:Finally, a round of traditional spirits properly poured, raising our level of civility as the temp drops from rain to snow.\"You know it was Senator Hatfield who pushed this through?\"\"The Grandee Ronde?\"\"Ya, he did most of the Wild and Scenic Designations in Oregon. Long before it was popular.\"\"What opposition did he face?\" I asked, knee-jerk response of the politician in me.\"Mostly his own party. They'd say he was going to lock it up, let it burn, stop all hunting, kill western heritage and destroy private property rights. You know, the same stuff they always say before something is protected.\"The landmark Oregon Omnibus National Wild and Scenic River Act of 1988 was passed in the heat of the spotted owl debate. Senator Hatfield, having once floated the Rogue, falling in love with the wild and natural stretches of the lower river, weighed the effects of protecting natural waterways with the risks of development. The no-holds-barred, \"If you're gonna do it, do it right\" ethic of Senator Hatfield's office created the national model for rivers, which we now are floating. The historical bullet points of his accomplishment are easy to recite, but the stand-alone leadership his stance required, which many have forgotten, deserves the credit. Imagine the diplomacy, the finesse of a Republican who worked simultaneously to save timber jobs and prevent riverbanks from being logged. Many cried fouled, others charged hypocrisy, some conservatives said \"not Republican enough,\" while liberals claimed \"not environmental enough,\" all of which makes you wonder why in the world a powerful U.S. Senator would put himself out there like that?The controversies reached an alarming pitch. Many private property advocates got national special interest money behind them to promote the false impression this was a power grab by the Forest Service to take over private property rights. So much so that three of Oregon's rivers -- the John Day, The Alsea and the Nestucca -- were left out of the measure.Even if there were a thread of truth to any of those claims, and for the sake of argument, let's say there was, nevertheless, Hatfield crafted a compromise creating three levels of restrictions: Recreational rivers are the least restrictive, followed by the Scenic category, and then the largely roadless, Wild designation. This Act remains the largest river protection legislation in the nation's history, adding forty Oregon Rivers, totaling 1,500 river miles, to the National Wild and Scenic River system.Twenty-five years later, we are floating on a Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic section, and I have to admire someone who loved rivers enough to protect this place while promising not to satisfy anyone. Doing the right thing for the right reasons in 1988 was every inch as difficult as trying to reach an accord today. \"All these years later, every fear was unfounded, and this place is part of the economy of Wallow County,\" Landrover concludes, smiling proudly. That statement hit the rest of us like a tranquilizer dart, and we all sat quiet for a while, sipping and thinking and giving thanks.

Despite ongoing reassurances from farmers that methods of bile extraction are \"humane\" we have seen not one bear to this day who would lay willingly down for such an invasive procedure that compromises their physical and psychological health.Today, our sanctuaries in China and Vietnam bear witness to the reality of surgical mutilation and exploitation on a scale hard to comprehend. As over 500 bears are welcomed in to new lives, where their fear and pain are understood and brought to an end, we persevere to retain the patience and resilience necessary for working on the ground, until this cruelty ends.In Vietnam we have made multiple investigations of these miserable farms; catching the farmers in the act of bile extraction, despite laws that make this practice illegal today.One such trip saw Tuan Bendixsen, our Vietnam Director and I, seeing bear farm staff fleeing in the other direction when we made a visit to Halong Bay. A coach filled with tourists was also seen driving quickly away from the scene, leaving us in no doubt that there would be unconscious bears on the farm, having had their \"fresh\" bile extracted and sold to gullible people who believed that it would cure cancers and hangovers, and anything else in between.How I wished we'd had a Traditional Medicine doctor with us at the time -- someone who could detail the real truth of bear bile remedies, how historically it has been used in such small amounts for specific illnesses, and that for every single medical problem there was a herbal or synthetic remedy instead. Thankfully, since then, we've worked with thousands of Traditional Medicine doctors across Asia, \"Healing without Harm\" and spreading the message that people won't die from a lack of bear bile.Here on the farm, as anticipated, there was a moon bear lying prone in the cage, with what was left of the bear farm staff swearing that he was asleep. Despite reaching in and shaking the bear's head by the ears, I failed to wake him (thus proving that he had been drugged), and Tuan and I continued to film the shopping list of proof that this animal had just been cruelly milked of his bile.Old swabs stained with the yellow/brown bile, the nooses that had restrained the bear's head and limbs whilst anaesthetised, the bottles of the illegal drug Ketamine -- all carefully filmed and documented, while the now twitching bear began waking up in to consciousness, after his abdomen and gall bladder had been punctured time and time again by a 4 inch needle locating and draining his bile.Still, despite the film, the evidence of our own eyes, and the subsequent world wide appeals to close this farm, the government were unable to act under the provisions of the law.Today, this cruel and barbaric act is repeated almost every day in the three bile farms that remain in Halong Bay -- a remarkable UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Gulf of Tonkin, with its beautiful islands and seascape of limestone pillars... and with its dirty little secret of bear bile extraction.Bear farming is illegal in Vietnam but, in 2004 bear bile farmers were given the opportunity of officially micro-chipping and registering their bears, thus keeping them for public display, and as \"pets\". Any bears found without microchips from 2005 were deemed illegal, and confiscated by the authorities, where NGO's like ourselves could provide sanctuary for the rest of their lives.Just this past November our team were once again at Halong Bay. Flanked by government officials, and a police guard - Tuan and our veterinary staff were investigating the three remaining farms. On the worst they recoiled, healthchecking emaciated bears that were severely malnourished, wounded, obviously continuing to have their bile extracted - and dying in front of their eyes.Since visiting the three farms that day, 26 of the 49 bears have died -- and still government departments have failed to take decisive action and give Animals Asia a mandate to rescue the bears.It breaks our hearts to think how these bears have died. Where are the bodies, or the body parts of these bears? How is the farmer being held accountable? And how are the owners of all of these farms allowed to continue flouting the law and laughing all the way to the bank?So now, we need your help -- please --  in joining us in an appeal to the Prime Minister of Vietnam himself.

Globally, aviation accounts for five percent of climate change and is the fastest growing source of transportation emissions, expected to double by 2020 and quadruple by 2050.   The airline industry wants regulators to believe they are doing everything they can by making dubious assertions like \"we take our role in controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions very seriously\" and are \"committed to 1.5 percent annual average fuel efficiency improvements through 2020.\"The industry has never let the facts get in the way of a good message, but a recent report from the International Council on Clean Technology (ICCT) shoots holes in the claims big enough to fly a Boeing 747 through.The report analyzed the fuel efficiency, and therefore carbon intensity, of domestic airlines operating in the U.S. in 2013. The report clearly shows that fuel efficiency improvements have been slowing since 2010 and in 2013 there was no net gain in fuel efficiency.American Airlines, the nations largest carrier, actually saw its fuel efficiency drop 1.5 percent in 2013. This stagnant growth in efficiency comes as airlines are making record profits driven in most part by low fuel costs. The ICCT report also highlights that there is no correlation between fuel efficiency and profitability of airlines, so if profit is not driving innovation - sound policy and the health of our children should.The industry touts its dedication to \"reinvigorating research and development\" in aviation technology and calls aviation biofuels a \"game-changer.\" However, studies like this one from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) once again clips their wings.This MMU report shows that the most effective way to reduce aviation emissions is through market-based measures, while the least effective route is through expanded use of biofuels.Additionally, finding readily available, cost-effective sources of biofuels that don't come at the expense of forests, native ecosystems and food security is no small feat and years in the making. Having predictable limits on aviation pollution will only help incentivize and accelerate R&D into sustainable biofuels development and deployment.The mission of airline lobbyists is to protect their clients interests, even if it requires shilling hollow commitments and half truths. It is the purpose of the EPA to \"ensure that all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work.\"The EPA has the authority and a court mandate to fulfill its mission. Rather than waiting on ICAO to do nothing as the industry requests, EPA should move forward with a strong domestic policy that will drive international ambition on reducing the harmful effects of aviation pollution.This post includes contributions from Shelby White, Campaign Director for the Flying Clean Campaign."}, {"title": "The Climate Post: Clean Power Plan Targets May Change", "text": "The EPA administrator this week suggested that interim goals for existing power plants to comply with the agency's proposed Clean Power Plan could be softened before the rule is finalized this summer.The proposal unveiled last year calls for a 30-percent reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and sets state-by-state emissions targets, beginning as early as 2020. Regulators and electric utilities have complained that a lack of time could destabilize electric supplies. According to the News and World Report, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy stated that changes to the 2020 date are \"very, very much on the table.\"\"While states can craft their own glide path, we want to make sure they hit the targets that we need and they're going to be effective strategies,\" McCarthy told an audience at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' winter meeting. \"We clearly need to make sure there is trajectory towards a goal that is as far away as 2030, and that there is an ability to ensure that states are actively working and on a trajectory to achieve that final goal.\"New Climate Agreement Draft Long on Diversity of Views, Short on Resolutions\"[Eighty-six pages], 54000words, 1234square brackets: here's official draft of #Paris2015 #UNFCCC agreement\" -- that's how Sébastien Duyck, an Arctic Centre researcher and observer at last week's climate talks in Geneva, summarized the proceedings' output on Twitter. The draft negotiated in Lima last November more than doubled in size, and the number of words, phrases, and sentences not agreed upon by all countries (the brackets referred to in Duyck's tweet) also increased, but although the new draft became more complex (not simpler, as planned), it represents progress to some participants.\"Although it has become longer, countries are now fully aware of each other's positions,\" said Christiana Figueres, the head of the United Nations climate change secretariat.\"After years of false starts and broken promises, restoring ownership and trust in the process is no small achievement. And I think we have come a long way toward doing that,\" said Ahmed Sareer, a Maldives delegate who represents an alliance of island nations.Among the new draft's significantly varying proposals for checking climate change are a goal of zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a peaking of emissions \"as soon as possible.\"In new text, developed countries, including the United States, emphasized the need for all countries to contribute to emissions-reduction efforts, and developing countries asked for financial help to deal with climate change.The international agreement, to be reached in Paris in December, is supposed to go into effect in 2020. The next critical date is June in Bonn, where all countries are to announce their emissions-reduction plans.Experts Debate Economic, Carbon Impacts of Biomass Conversion to ElectricityLast November the EPA issued a policy memo that appeared to promote the harvest of forests to produce power by treating bioenergy as a carbon-free energy source. But there are a couple of problems with that strategy, reports The New York Times. It ignores the opportunity cost of dedicating land to bioenergy rather than to other purposes, potentially imperiling food supplies and ecosystems -- and, according to a recent World Resources Institute report, energy from forests and fields is not carbon-neutral.In a Feb. 9 letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy that decries the new power plant policy, 78 scientists said, \"Burning biomass instead of fossil fuels does not reduce the carbon emitted by power plants.\" In fact, \"Burning biomass, such as trees, that would otherwise continue to absorb and store carbon comes at the expense of reduced carbon storage.\"In a Feb. 11 letter to McCarthy, six Massachusetts-based environmental groups also opposed the policy, stating, \"We are pleased that EPA is moving forward with the Clean Power Plan. However, we write to express our deep concern at EPA's apparent decision to treat biomass power as carbon neutral for the purposes of EPA's Clean Power Plan and Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting.\" They added that the decision \"contradicts sound science and promotes burning forest wood for electric power production, which is exactly the wrong direction for our county's renewable energy policy.\"But a just-published report in the journal Nature Climate Change argues that deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) could produce a net reduction in atmospheric carbon -- with up to a 145-percent emissions cut from 1990 levels. Moreover, according to energy expert and study co-author Daniel Kammen, BECCS may be one of the few cost-effective carbon-negative opportunities available to mitigate the worst effects of climate change and could be critical should that change be worse than anticipated or should emissions reductions in non-energy sectors prove difficult to realize.On the basis of an analysis of various fuel scenarios using a detailed model of the American West power grid developed at the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory, the University of California Berkeley's report predicts that biomass conversion to electricity combined with prospective carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies could result in a carbon-negative power grid in the western United States by 2050.\"There are a lot of commercial uncertainties about carbon capture and sequestration technologies,\" admitted the study leader, Daniel Sanchez. \"Nevertheless, we're taking this technology and showing that in the Western United States 35 years from now, BECCS doesn't merely let you reduce emissions by 80 percent -- the current 2050 goal in California -- but gets the power system to negative carbon emissions: you store more carbon than you create.\"These latest contributions add to and continue what has been several years of debate on the possible benefits and drawbacks of biomass energy and how best to quantify the ultimate impact of its use.The Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.

Winter storms have set some crazy snowfall records, and New England has been hit with an endless cycle of freezing temperatures.But nationally, the country has been going through a surprisingly warm winter. According to the National Climatic Data Center, the December 2014 to January 2015 period has been the sixth warmest in the contiguous U.S. since record-keeping began in 1895. This January was also the second warmest on record globally.Nine states in the West have had a winter that ranks among the 10 warmest on record, and temps in drought-plagued California have been more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above average. Total precipitation levels have also been lower than average.Source: National Climatic Data Center/NOAANearly 3,500 records for daily high temperatures were broken or tied in January around the country, according to the NCDC, and 4,074 have already been set this month.

If you live in those areas, remember to stock up on emergency preparedness gear, and don't forget about keeping your pets safe as well.And in case your climate change-denying relatives mention the cold right now as evidence that global warming is a hoax, remind them that weather is not climate; a few cold days don't change the overall temperature trends, which are going up.

But after the crowds lost interest, it was Hogarth's job to cut down the nearly half-ton behemoths and watch their lifeless bodies float out to sea.Some 50 years ago, many people saw the ocean's bounty as limitless. But those images of wasted fish made a lasting impression on Hogarth, who eventually brought a conservation ethic to his role as the country's head of ocean fisheries under President George W. Bush.\"You could see the impact of the waste. I remember thinking that this couldn't last,\" recalled Hogarth, now 75 and director of the Florida Institute of Oceanography at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. I caught up with him recently when I went to Florida to oversee planning for The Pew Charitable Trusts' ocean conservation work in the Southeast.Bill Hogarth (right), former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's FisheriesService, shows off his catch after a 2007 fishing trip in Alaska with then-Senator Ted Stevens. The workof Stevens, who died in 2010, strengthened conservation provisions of the federal fishery law, which isThrough my years of environmental conservation work, I've seen Hogarth stay true to his mission: helping ensure that the nation has abundant fish for the future. He led efforts in 2006 to make sure fishery managers had deadlines for making plans to end overfishing. He told me he believes his successful push for changes to the nation's primary fish law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, has put billions of dollars into the economy as dozens of depleted fish populations have recovered.\"I would hate to see Magnuson reopened to weaken the law,\" he said of current efforts to do that. \"There's just not enough fish to go around. A lot of people see the ocean as a vast amount of water and think there is no way anyone could catch all those fish. We haven't done a good job of teaching conservation. People understand conservation rules on land. But when it comes to saltwater, it becomes a different mentality.\"As a young man, Hogarth never dreamed of a career in fish management. He grew up in a Virginia town of 600 residents, raised by his mother and three older sisters after his father died. Young Bill intended to go to medical school. But after working as a scrub nurse and losing interest in his studies, he had a chance encounter with a professor who was studying fish. Like me, he found fish fascinating.Hogarth meets with Lee Crockett, director of fish policy at The Pew Charitable Trusts, inHogarth went on to receive a doctorate in marine biology from North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Except for a brief stint as a grocery store owner, his career path in fish management was straight to the top. He worked 16 years for a North Carolina power company analyzing the impacts of nuclear plant discharges on the marine environment. He quit to head fisheries policy for the state for nine years, and then moved to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Fisheries Service, where I got to know him. Humble yet outgoing, smart and straightforward, he had an ability to bring competing interests to the table--a talent that didn't go unnoticed. So in 2001 he was tapped by the U.S. secretary of commerce to lead the fisheries service.\"Most of my work had been in the Southeast and on local issues. I wondered if I had the right background. I questioned myself if I could do it and not fail. It was humbling. But I sort of felt I had a good team and I wasn't in it by myself,\" Hogarth told me.While serving as director of North Carolina's fish policy in the 1980s, Hogarth (left) spends a dayHis doubts proved unwarranted. His seven years at the helm were marked by many achievements, including the 2006 renewal and overhaul of federal fish law, a dramatic improvement that dictates fishing rules affecting every saltwater angler and commercial fisherman today. It was a hard-fought battle: With Congress at an impasse in the waning days of its session, the renewal almost didn't happen, especially after Congress demanded certainty that the measure would end overfishing and that depleted fish populations would recover. So Hogarth and others devised a system for reducing fishing rates when species were in trouble. They understood that some economic hardship could follow when fishing restrictions would be needed.\"We were convinced we could get over the short-term pain for long-term gain,\" he said, crediting President Bush with backing what had to be done. \"He was always very supportive. He was an avid sportsman and didn't question the conservation regulations. I never got any pushback.\"Today, Hogarth agrees with me that tweaking rules under the existing law--rather than making larger changes to the law itself--can help resolve problems that remain, including getting a better handle on how to manage recreational fishing and how to deal with fish species that are recovering. He pointed to current struggles with the Gulf of Mexico red snapper, which is recovering from years of overfishing. Fish are getting larger, so quotas are met faster. Fishing seasons grow shorter even though the fish population is getting healthier--a conundrum that is hard for people to understand. Hogarth said educating the public and improving information about what fish, and how many, are being caught are challenges for the future.\"People believe we should have all the fish we want but don't realize we'll get back to where we were if we don't protect the spawners that can reproduce and replenish populations,\" he said.Fish management today, Hogarth told me, is complicated by more fishing made easier with better technology--and environmental changes such as warming seas. But he describes one basic tenet that should guide all decisions: \"You have to decide early in the game that fish are a public resource and everyone should enjoy the benefits.\""}, {"title": "The Ancient Greeks, Pacific Islanders, And Maya All Ignored This One Thing.

In 2013, some 70 percent of nursing pups perished in what NOAA declared an \"unusual mortality event\" linked to strandings.Melin said pups checked on San Miquel Island this month were 44 percent below average weight at seven months old, marking the lowest growth rate since scientists began recording such measurements in the 1990s.Most of the stranded pups have been recovered in Southern California, but the pups also swim or are carried further north, and may eventually turn up in Washington state and Oregon, according to Johnson.\"We're braced for more,\" Johnson said.
